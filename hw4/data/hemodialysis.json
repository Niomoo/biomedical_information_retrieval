    "title": "[Chronic renal failure and hemodialysis in Lom\u00e9: are patients on haemodialysis and their entourage well informed?]",
    "content": "End stage renal failure requires substitution therapy, including hemodialysis. Before initiation, patients and their entourage receive information on renal disease and treatment options. The purpose of this study is to assess the level of knowledge as well as the opinion of patients on haemodialysis and of their entourage on chronic kidney disease and substitution therapies. We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study in the Department of Haemodialysis at the Sylvanus Olympio University Hospital (CHU-SO) from 29 July to 19 August 2020. The study population was composed by all the haemodialysis patients in the Department of Haemodialysis at the CHU-SO and by their accompanying persons who gave their free and informed consent. Anonymous survey was used to collect data. Data collection and statistical analysis were carried out using the Epi Info software 7.2.2.6. Eighty-one patients and 79 accompanying persons were interviewed. The average ages of patients and their accompanying persons were 49.7 years \u00b1 13.5 and 39,6years \u00b1 13.2 respectively. All patients knew their disease and 94% of accompanying persons were informed about their parents' disease. Hemodialysis was considered very expensive by 95.1% of patients. Patients stated that improved quality of life was the most known benefit of hemodialysis (80.2%) while 15% also thought that renal transplantation was equally effective. The majority of accompanying persons (85%) stated that hemodialysis was the best treatment. Haemodialysis education program for patients and their accompanying persons is essential to better overall management of haemodialysis patients."

    "title": "Using patient feedback to adapt intervention materials based on acceptance and commitment therapy for people receiving renal dialysis.",
    "content": "Theory-based intervention materials must be carefully adapted to meet the needs of users with specific physical conditions. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has been adapted successfully for cancer, chronic pain, diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome, multiple sclerosis, and a range of other conditions, but not so far for people receiving renal haemodialysis. This paper presents findings from a study to adapt ACT-based intervention materials specifically for renal dialysis.Draft written materials consisting of four stories depicting fictitious individuals who used ACT-related techniques to help overcome different challenges and difficulties related to dialysis were adapted using a systematic patient consultation process. The participants were 18 people aged 19-80\u00a0years, with chronic kidney disease and receiving renal dialysis. Individual, semi-structured interviews were conducted to elicit participants' views about how the content of the draft materials should be adapted to make them more realistic and relevant for people receiving renal dialysis and about how the materials should be presented and delivered to people receiving renal dialysis. The interview transcripts were analysed using a qualitative adaptation of the Delphi method in which themes are used as a framework for translating feedback into proposals for modifications.The analysis of patient feedback supported the use of patient stories but suggested they should be presented by video and narrated by real dialysis patients. They also indicated specific adaptations to make the stories more credible and realistic. Participant feedback was translated into proposals for change that were considered along with clinical, ethical and theoretical factors. The outcome was a design for a video-based intervention that separated the stories about individuals from the explanations of the specific ACT techniques and provided greater structure, with material organised into smaller chunks. This intervention is adapted specifically for people receiving renal dialysis while retaining the distinctive theoretical principles of ACT.The study shows the value of consulting patients in the development of intervention materials and illustrates a process for integrating patient feedback with theoretical, clinical and practical considerations in intervention design."

    "title": "Direct and indirect costs of end-stage renal disease patients in the first and second years after initiation of nocturnal home haemodialysis, hospital haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.",
    "content": "To estimate the direct and indirect costs of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients in the first and second years of initiating peritoneal dialysis (PD), hospital-based haemodialysis (HD) and nocturnal home HD.A cost analysis was performed to estimate the annual costs of PD, hospital-based HD and nocturnal home HD for ESRD patients from both the health service provider's and societal perspectives. Empirical data on healthcare resource use, patients' out-of-pocket costs, time spent on transportation and dialysis by ESRD patients and time spent by caregivers were analysed. All costs were expressed in Hong Kong year 2017 dollars.Analysis was based on 402 ESRD patients on maintenance dialysis (PD: 189; hospital-based HD: 170; and nocturnal home HD: 43). From the perspective of the healthcare provider, hospital-based HD had the highest total annual direct medical costs in the initial year (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD) (hospital-based HD = $400\u2009057 \u00b1 62\u2009822; PD = $118\u2009467 \u00b1 15\u2009559; nocturnal home HD = $223\u2009358 \u00b1 18\u2009055; P\u2009<\u20090.001) and second year (hospital-based HD = $360\u2009924\u2009 \u00b1 63\u2009014; PD = $80\u2009796 \u00b1 15\u2009820; nocturnal home HD = $87\u2009028 \u00b1 9059; P\u2009<\u20090.001). From the societal perspective, hospital-based HD had the highest total annual costs in the initial year (hospital-based HD = $452\u2009151\u2009 \u00b1 73\u2009327; PD = $189\u2009191 \u00b1 61\u2009735; nocturnal home HD = $242\u2009038 \u00b1 28\u2009281; P\u2009<\u20090.001) and second year (hospital-based HD = $413\u2009017 \u00b1 73\u2009501; PD = $151\u2009520 \u00b1 60\u2009353; nocturnal home HD = $105\u2009708 \u00b1 23\u2009853; P\u2009<\u20090.001).This study quantified the economic burden of ESRD patients, and assessed the annual healthcare and societal costs in the initial and second years of PD, hospital-based HD and nocturnal home HD in Hong Kong. From both perspectives, PD is cost-saving relative to hospital-based HD and nocturnal home HD, except that nocturnal home HD has the lowest cost in the second year of treatment from the societal perspective. Results from this cost analysis facilitate economic evaluation in Hong Kong for health services and management targeted at ESRD patients."

    "title": "Renal staffs' understanding of patients' experiences of transition from peritoneal dialysis to in-centre haemodialysis and their views on service improvement: A multi-site qualitative study in England and Australia.",
    "content": "Many studies have explored patients' experiences of dialysis and other treatments for kidney failure. This is the first qualitative multi-site international study of how staff perceive the process of a patient's transition from peritoneal dialysis to in-centre haemodialysis. Current literature suggests that transitions are poorly coordinated and may result in increased patient morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to understand staff perspectives of transition and to identify areas where clinical practice could be improved.Sixty-one participants (24 UK and 37 Australia), representing a cross-section of kidney care staff, took part in seven focus groups and sixteen interviews. Data were analysed inductively and findings were synthesised across the two countries.For staff, good clinical practice included: effective communication with patients, well planned care pathways and continuity of care. However, staff felt that how they communicated with patients about the treatment journey could be improved. Staff worried they inadvertently made patients fear haemodialysis when trying to explain to them why going onto peritoneal dialysis first is a good option. Despite staff efforts to make transitions smooth, good continuity of care between modalities was only reported in some of the Australian hospitals where, unlike the UK, patients kept the same consultant. Timely access to an appropriate service, such as a psychologist or social worker, was not always available when staff felt it would be beneficial for the patient. Staff were aware of a disparity in access to kidney care and other healthcare professional services between some patient groups, especially those living in remote areas. This was often put down to the lack of funding and capacity within each hospital.This research found that continuity of care between modalities was valued by staff but did not always happen. It also highlighted a number of areas for consideration when developing ways to improve care and provide appropriate support to patients as they transition from peritoneal dialysis to in-centre haemodialysis."

    "content": "Hypomagnesaemia in haemodialysis (HD) is associated with increased mortality risk: its relationship with dialysis fluid (DF).Low concentrations of magnesium (Mg) in blood have been linked to the development of diabetes, hypertension, arrhythmias, vascular calcifications and an increased risk of death in the general population and in haemodialysis patients. The composition of the dialysis fluid in terms of its magnesium concentration is one of the main determinants of magnesium in haemodialysis patients.To study magnesium concentrations in haemodialysis patients, their predictive mortality rate and what factors are associated with hypomagnesaemia and mortality in haemodialysis.Retrospective study of a cohort of prevalent haemodialysis patients followed up for two years. Serum magnesium was measured every six months. The analysis used the initial and average magnesium values for each patient, comparing patients with magnesium below the mean (2.1mg/dl) with those with magnesium above the mean. During the follow-up, three types of dialysis fluid were used: type 1, magnesium 0.5 mmol/l; type 3, magnesium 0.37 mmol/l (both with acetate); and type 2, magnesium 0.5 mmol/l with citrate.We included 137 haemodialysis patients in the study, of which 72 were male and 65 were female, with a mean age of 67 (15) [26-95] years old. Of this group, 57 patients were diabetic, 70 were on online haemodiafiltration (OL-HDF) and 67 were on high-flow haemodialysis (HF-HD). The mean magnesium of the 93 patients with dialysis fluid type 1 was 2.18 (0.37) mg/dl. In the 27 patients with dialysis fluid type 3 it was 2.02 (0.42) mg/dl. And in the 17 with dialysis fluid type 2 it was 1.84 (0.24) mg/dl (p=.01). There was a pronounced direct relationship between Mg and P and albumin. After a mean follow-up of 16.6 (8.9) [3-24] months, 77 remained active, 24 had died and 36 had been transplanted or transferred. Patients with magnesium above than 2.1mg/dl had a longer survival (p=.008). The survival of patients with the three types of dialysis fluid did not differ significantly (Log-Rank, p=.424). Corrected for blood magnesium, patients with dialysis fluid with citrate have better survival (p=.009). The COX regression analysis shows how age, serum albumin, magnesium, dialysis technique and type of dialysis fluid have an independent predictive mortality rate.Low serum magnesium levels have a greater association with an increased risk of mortality compared to high levels. The type of dialysis fluid affects the magnesium concentration and the risk of death."

    "content": "To evaluate the effects of hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and renal transplantation on the quality of life of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and analyze the influencing factors.A total of 162 ESRD patients who received maintenance hemodialysis, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, and renal transplantation from February 2017 to March 2018 in our hospital were divided into a hemodialysis group, a peritoneal dialysis group, and a renal transplantation group. The baseline clinical data, serum indices, as well as environmental factors such as education level, marital status, work, residential pattern, household income, and expenditure were recorded. The quality of life was assessed using the short-form 36-item (SF-36) scale reflecting the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS). One-way analysis of variance and logistic stepwise multiple regression analysis were performed to analyze the factors influencing the quality of life.The renal transplantation group had the highest average scores for all dimensions of the SF-36 scale. The PCS and MCS scores of this group were higher than those of the hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis groups. The peritoneal dialysis group had higher scores for physical functioning, physical role, bodily pain, general health, mental health, PCS, and MCS than those of the hemodialysis group. Age, HGB, GLU, and ALP were the main factors influencing PCS. Age, education level, residential pattern, medication expenditure, and monthly per capita income mainly affected MCS.In terms of quality of life, renal transplantation is superior to peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis."

    "content": "BACKGROUND This study compared the effects of peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis on cognitive dysfunction and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients and analyzed other potential influencing factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 265 patients who received dialysis at our hospital were included and divided into the hemodialysis group (n=115) and the peritoneal dialysis group (n=150). The cognitive performance was assessed by the Beijing version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. The Kidney Disease Quality of 36-Item Short Form Survey and a kidney disease-related quality of life assessment were used for evaluating HRQOL. Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were used to explore the effects of dialysis on cognitive dysfunction and HRQOL. RESULTS As compared with the hemodialysis group, the peritoneal dialysis group had lower scores on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (\u00df=-8.35, 95% CI: -9.85 to -6.86), 36-Item Short Form Survey (\u00df=-10.20, 95% CI: -11.94 to -8.45), and kidney disease-related quality of life assessment (\u00df=-8.67, 95% CI: -10.10 to -7.23). After adjustment for sex, age, BMI, marital status, educational level, income level, presence of diabetes, duration of kidney disease, duration of dialysis, and dialysis frequency, the results were consistent with that of the crude model. CONCLUSIONS In the present study, patients receiving peritoneal dialysis had worse cognitive dysfunction and worse HRQOL compared to patients receiving hemodialysis, which might lead to poorer outcomes of ESRD patients. The related factors affecting cognitive dysfunction and HRQOL were also explored, which could help clinicians to determine the optimal treatment for ESRD patients."

    "content": "Patients on renal dialysis often develop severe acne. In spite of this, the literature remains scarce about the use of isotretinoin for the treatment of acne in this group of patients, and many clinicians remain apprehensive and hesitant to use it.To systematically review the literature surrounding the safety and efficacy of isotretinoin for the treatment of acne in patients on renal dialysis.Four electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Emcare) were systematically searched in March 2021. The search strategy incorporated the terms 'isotretinoin', 'renal', 'kidney', 'dialysis' and 'acne', along with terms closely related to these. Studies were considered eligible if they reported the use of isotretinoin for treatment of acne in patients with renal impairment or on renal dialysis, and if they had relevant implications to this topic.The search resulted in a total of 63 results. Using the PRISMA approach, 11 articles were deemed relevant to this review: 1 randomized single-blinded placebo-controlled trial, 2 case series, 2 retrospective studies and 6 case reports. Hence the level of evidence was mostly low (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations level 3).This review of the literature suggests that low-dose isotretinoin (10-20\u2009mg) can safely and successfully be used to treat severe acne in patients on renal dialysis, leading to a significant improvement in their quality of life. As the current literature on this topic is scarce, more studies would be beneficial to further establish the safe use of isotretinoin in patients on renal dialysis."

    "content": "Cryptococcosis is a lethal fungal infection mainly caused by Cryptococcus neoformans/C. gattii species. Currently, our understanding of cryptococcosis episodes in HIV-negative patients during renal dialysis remains scarce and fragmented. Here, we performed an analysis of pooled cases to systemically summarize the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of cryptococcosis among HIV-negative patients with renal dialysis. Using pooled data from our hospital and studies identified in four medical databases, 18 cases were identified and analyzed. The median duration time of renal dialysis for peritoneal renal dialysis and hemodialysis cases was 8\u00a0months and 36\u00a0months, respectively. Several non-neoformans/gattii species were identified among the renal dialysis recipients with cryptococcosis, particularly Cryptococcus laurentii and Cryptococcus albidus, which share similar clinical manifestations as those caused by C. neoformans and C. gattii. Our analyses suggest that physicians should consider the possibility of the occurrence of cryptococcosis among renal dialysis recipients even when cryptococcal antigen test result is negative. The timely removal of the catheter is crucial for peritoneal dialysis patients with cryptococcosis. In addition, there is a need for optimized antifungal treatment strategy in renal dialysis recipients with cryptococcal infections."

    "content": "The aim was to compare dental and skeletal indices in panoramic radiography between patients undergoing haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and age- and sex-matched control group.In this comparative cross-sectional study, quantitative Indices including Antegonial Index (AI), Mental Index (MI), Panoramic Mandibular Index (PMI) and qualitative indices including Mandibular Cortical Index (MCI) and Trabecular Pattern (TP) were evaluated in panoramic images of 32 haemodialysis patients, 14 patients under peritoneal dialysis and 52 healthy individuals. The images were also investigated for pulp canal calcification, pulp stones, soft tissue calcification, changes in or loss of lamina dura, radiolucencies associated with brown tumour and ridge resorption. The indices were compared between the three groups and were investigated for association with the patients' blood test parameters and their diseases causing chronic renal failure (CRF). Intraobserver agreement for the 2-week interval of assessment was calculated for the indices.MI (<i>p</i> = 0.574) and PMI (<i>p</i> = 0.100) were not significantly different, but AI (<i>p</i> = 0.01), MCI (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and TP (<i>p</i> = 0.002) were significantly different between the two case groups and the control group. The prevalence of pulp calcification (<i>p</i> = 0.03) and ridge resorption (<i>p</i> = 0.005) was higher in the haemodialysis group. Soft tissue calcification (<i>p</i> = 0.85) and lamina dura changes (<i>p</i> = 0.9) showed no significant difference. Brown tumours were observed in only one case in the haemodialysis group.AI, MCI and TP showed a reduction in mineral density of the cortical and trabecular bone in CRF patients and more severely in patients under haemodialysis than those under peritoneal dialysis."

The aim of this study is to assess differences in prevalence and symptom dimensions of anxiety and depression between patients receiving peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis.Baseline data from the Depression Related Factors and Outcomes in Dialysis Patients With Various Ethnicities and Races Study were used. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured with the Beck Anxiety Inventory and Beck Depression Inventory- second edition. Linear and logistic regression models were used to compare anxiety and depression total scores and somatic and subjective/cognitive symptom dimension scores between patients receiving peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis, adjusted for potential confounders.In total, 84 patients receiving peritoneal dialysis and 601 patients receiving haemodialysis were included. Clinically significant symptoms of anxiety and depression were present in respectively 22% and 43% of the patients, with no differences between dialysis modality. Both modalities scored high on the somatic symptom dimensions and on individual somatic items. Almost all patients reported symptoms related to loss of energy and sleep.No differences in symptom dimensions of anxiety and depression were found between patients receiving peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis. The high prevalence of somatic symptom dimensions in both groups underscores the possible interaction between somatic and psychiatric symptoms in dialysis patients and the need for early recognition and treatment of symptoms of anxiety and depression regardless of treatment modalities."

Pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure (SBP) more than 160\u2009mmHg was thought to be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. The present study was performed to explore the clinical characteristics and management of hemodialysis patients with pre-dialysis SBP \u2265 160\u2009mmHg.A total of 1233 patients undergoing hemodialysis from nine hemodialysis centers were enrolled. Pre-dialysis and home BP were measured and clinical data were collected. The characteristics of patients with pre-dialysis SBP \u2265 160\u2009mmHg were explored. Clinical parameters between hypertensive and non-hypertensive patients were compared. The partial correlation analyses performed to identify the associations between BP and clinical parameters.There were 24.6% of the hemodialysis patients had pre-dialysis SBP \u2265 160\u2009mmHg and the average SBP was 173.8\u2009\u00b1\u200910.9\u2009mmHg. Only 21.4% of the patients achieved dry weight after dialysis and up to 30.2% of patients were not given combination therapies of antihypertensive drugs. Compared to patients with pre-hemodialysis SBP < 160\u2009mmHg, patients with pre-dialysis SBP \u2265 160\u2009mmHg had lower target-reaching rate of Kt/v and higher incidences of intradialytic hypotension and muscle spasm. Most patients (96%) with pre-dialysis SBP \u2265 160\u2009mmHg had home SBP\u2265 135\u2009mmHg. Patients with home SBP \u2265 160\u2009mmHg had higher left ventricular weight index and lower hemoglobin levels when compared to their counterparts with home SBP <160\u2009mmHg.Pre-dialysis SBP \u2265 160\u2009mmHg is common in clinical practice and most of the patients could diagnosed to be hypertensive according to their home SBP. Patients with pre-dialysis SBP \u2265 160\u2009mmHg are more likely to be subjected to dialysis insufficiency and intradialytic complications. Achieving dry weight and sufficient pharmacologic interventions should be strengthened to improve BP control in the hemodialysis population."

To improve the understanding of transmission risks in six Scottish renal dialysis units, we utilised the rapid whole-genome sequencing data generated by the COG-UK consortium.We combined geographical, temporal and genomic sequence data from the community and hospital to estimate the probability of infection originating from within the dialysis unit, the hospital or the community using Bayesian statistical modelling and compared these results to the details of epidemiological investigations.Of 671 patients, 60 (8.9%) became infected with SARS-CoV-2, of whom 16 (27%) died. Within-unit and community transmission were both evident and an instance of transmission from the wider hospital setting was also demonstrated.Near-real-time SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data can facilitate tailored infection prevention and control measures, which can be targeted at reducing risk in these settings."

We herein report the experience of the Hemodialysis Unit of Parma University Hospital (Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria, Parma, Italy) and the Dialysis Centers of Parma territory, in the period from March 1st, 2020 to June 15, 2020. Among patients undergoing chronic haemodialysis, 37/283 (13%) had positive swabs for SARS\u2011CoV\u20112, 9/37 (24%) died because of COVID-19. Twenty-three patients required hospitalization, while the remaining were managed at home. The primary measures applied to contain the infection were: the strengthening of personal protective equipment use by doctors and nurses, early identification of infected subjects by performing oro-pharyngeal swabs in every patient and in the healthcare personnel, the institution of a triage protocol when entering Dialysis Room, and finally the institution of two separate sections, managed by different doctors and dialysis nurses, to physically separate affected from unaffected patients and to manage \"grey\" patients. Our experience highlights the importance and effectiveness of afore-mentioned measures in order to contain the spread of the virus; moreover, we observed a higher lethality rate of COVID-19 in dialysis patients as compared to the general population."

    "content": "This study attempts to develop and determine the effect a rational-emotive-behaviour-therapy-based self-management programme can have on the self-efficacy, self-care, depression and dyssomnia of patients undergoing early renal dialysis.When renal dialysis is initiated, changes in everyday life are inevitable, and patients can suffer from both psychological and physical symptoms. Hence, to obtain the best results from renal dialysis, active self-management is required.Quasi-experimental and longitudinal.Forty-eight early-stage renal dialysis patients registered for and undergoing renal dialysis at a hospital located in S city participated in this study.\u00a0These individuals were divided into an experimental and control group. The former group engaged in a self-management programme consisting of eight weekly sessions of 50\u00a0min in duration, while the latter received traditional nursing care. Data were collected from June 2012-May 2014 through the use of a preliminary survey, a postsurvey that was distributed after the eight sessions of the self-management programme had been completed, and a follow-up survey allocated 4\u00a0weeks after the postsurvey. Data collection was conducted using the Self-efficacy Scale, Self-care Practice Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, and Korean Sleep Scale, and a repeated-measures ANOVA was used to perform analysis.The experimental group significantly differed from the control group in regard to self-efficacy (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006) and self-care (p\u00a0=\u00a00.031), but differences in terms of depression (p\u00a0=\u00a00.492) and dyssomnia (p\u00a0=\u00a00.141) were nonsignificant. In the experimental group, the depression decreased but then increased again, while the dyssomnia gradually decreased.The provision of a rational-emotive-behaviour-therapy-based self-management programme that involves lectures, discussions, teach-backs, demonstrations and posters explaining diet choices improves the self-efficacy and self-care of patients receiving renal dialysis.Rational-emotive-behaviour-therapy-based self-management programmes can be used in clinical nursing sites to improve the self-efficacy and self-care of early renal dialysis patients."

We hypothesized that gender differences in health care access exist and therefore aimed at determining whether characteristics and outcomes of haemodialysis patients over time differ by sex.We studied all 28\u00a0323 adults who began haemodialysis during 1965-2014 in the Austrian Dialysis Registry, analysing trends in patient characteristics by sex and decade with mortality (via Cox regression), which was compared with the mortality of the Austrian general population.More men than women started haemodialysis (60.1% men versus 39.9% women overall), with minor differences among decades and age groups. The male:female mortality rate ratio in the general population ranged from 1.2 to 2.4 for age groups >18\u2009years and in haemodialysis patients ranged from 0.80 to 1.3 (closer to 1 than in the general population, but consistently >1 in Decades 3-5). In recent decades, diabetes and hypertension replaced glomerulonephritis as the primary cause of end-stage renal disease in both men and women. Interaction analyses showed the mortality risk associated with haemodialysis access (only recorded in Decade 5) was significantly lower for men than for women.The male:female mortality rate ratio and the proportion of women starting haemodialysis were remarkably stable, which does not support the hypothesis of gender differences in health care/haemodialysis access or could imply that such differences might have persisted over decades. Future research should expand to other countries and other forms of RRT."

Subjects were patients aged 65-99 years who underwent surgical treatment for femoral neck fractures or intertrochanteric fractures. A generalized estimating equation model with Poisson distribution and logarithmic link function was used to estimate adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to measure associations between renal dialysis and cumulative mortality in various time frames.The total number of patients included in this study was 16,818. These patients were divided into two groups: 116 (0.69%) in the dialysis group and 16,702 (99.31%) in the no-dialysis group. The mean length of hospital stay was 43.87 \u00b1 48.45 days in the dialysis group and 36.29 \u00b1 37.49 days in the no-dialysis group (<i>P</i> = 0.095). The effect of renal dialysis on all-cause mortality was 2.29-fold (aRR; 95% CI, 1.29-4.06; <i>P</i> = 0.005) within 30 days and 1.72-fold (aRR; 95% CI, 1.34-2.21; <i>P</i> < 0.001) within 1-year after hip fracture compared to the no-dialysis group. And, the effect of renal dialysis of in-hospital mortality was 2.72-fold (aRR; 95% CI, 1.71-4.33; <i>P</i> < 0.001) compared to the no-dialysis group.Elderly patients who underwent dialysis have very high mortality rates after hip fracture. Therefore, it is considered that postoperative care through multidisciplinary management and understanding of pathophysiology for the ESRD patients is necessary."

    "content": "The extension of the interdialytic interval due to due to dialysis session non-attendance varies according to which session of the week the patient misses. The impact of this on subsequent hospitalization and mortality is unknown.The ARO cohort study prospectively collected data from hemodialysis patients across 15 European countries on demography, comorbidity, laboratory, hospitalisation, mortality and individual hemodialysis sessions from 2007 to 2014. Event rates for death and hospitalisation according to dialysis day of the week were calculated for patients who attended the three previous scheduled hemodialysis sessions, who then on the next scheduled dialysis day either attended or did not attend. The hazard ratio for these events following non-attendance for the first compared to the second dialysis session of the week was estimated using Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for patient demographics.3.8 million hemodialysis sessions in 9397 patients were analysed. The non-attendance rates for Monday/Wednesday/Friday sessions were 0.8, 0.9% & 1.4% respectively, and for Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday sessions were 0.6, 1.0% & 1.2% respectively. Compared to those who attended, for the 48-72\u2009h between non-attendance and the next scheduled haemodialysis session, mortality significantly increased from 4.86 to 51.9/100\u2009pt-yrs and hospitalisation increased from 0.58 to 2.1/yr. As time from the two-day break increased, the risk associated with non-attendance lessened: compared to missing the second hemodialysis session, missing the first session had a hazard ratio for mortality of 2.04 (95% CI 1.27-3.29), and for hospitalisation 1.78 (95% CI 1.29-2.47). In patients who attended their scheduled dialysis session and the three preceding, after the two-day break there were absolute increases in mortality (8.3 vs. 4.9/100\u2009pt-yrs) and hospitalisation (1.0 vs. 0.6/yr for the rest of the week) comparable to previous studies.In addition to hospitalisation and mortality increases seen after the two-day break, additional harm may be manifested in the greater increases in mortality and hospitalisation observed after non-attendance for the first hemodialysis session after the two-day break compared to missing other sessions."

    "content": "Pulmonary artery hypertension is a serious comorbidityof dialysis in patients with end-stage renal disease. The prevalence of dialysis-induced pulmonary artery hypertension is still a subject of debate. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of pulmonary artery hypertension in patients undergoing hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.This cross-sectional study was conducted on patients undergoing either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis in Montaserieh Dialysis Center in Mashhad, Iran during 2015 and 2016. Pulmonary artery pressure, ejection fraction, and serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, creatinine, and parathyroid hormone were measured.A total of 50 patients (25 on hemodialysis and 25 on peritoneal dialysis) participated in the study. The mean age of the participants was 34 \u00b1 12 years. The mean pulmonary artery pressure was significantly higher in the hemodialysis group compared to the peritoneal dialysis group (P < .001). Serum calcium was significantly higher in the peritoneal dialysis group compared (P = .04). Pulmonary artery hypertension was observed in 11 patients (22%), all of whom were in the hemodialysis group. There was a significant negative relationship between serum calcium and pulmonary artery pressure (P< .01). Hemodialysis was significantly related to higher pulmonary artery pressure (P < .001).This study revealed a high prevalence of pulmonary artery hypertension among end-stage renal disease patients undergoing dialysis. This study also found a novel significant negative relationship between serum calcium level and pulmonary artery pressure, and hemodialysis was found to be significantly related to higher pulmonary artery pressure."

However, the association between pre-dialysis diastolic blood pressure and intradialytic hypotension is not well understood.Patient-level (N\u2009=\u2009545) and haemodialysis session-level (N\u2009=\u20093261) data were collected; the exposure variable was pre-dialysis diastolic blood pressure. The primary outcome of interest was the development of intradialytic hypotension, defined as any nadir\u2009<\u2009100\u00a0mmHg if the pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure was\u2009\u2265\u2009160\u00a0mmHg, or any nadir\u2009<\u200990\u00a0mmHg if the pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure was\u2009<\u2009160\u00a0mmHg. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using mixed-effects logistic regression for the association between pre-dialysis diastolic blood pressure and intradialytic hypotension, after adjusting for potential confounders.Intradialytic hypotension occurred in 14.4% of the sessions. All sessions were divided into five categories according to pre-dialysis diastolic blood pressure. The adjusted ORs for intradialytic hypotension were 2.72 (95% CI 1.64-4.51), 1.07 (95% CI 0.68-1.66), 1.68 (95% CI 1.08-2.62), and 1.81 (95% CI 1.05-3.14) in sessions with pre-dialysis diastolic blood pressure of\u2009<\u200960\u00a0mmHg,\u2009\u2265\u200960 to\u2009<\u200970\u00a0mmHg,\u2009\u2265\u200980 to\u2009<\u200990\u00a0mmHg, and\u2009\u2265\u200990\u00a0mmHg, respectively, compared with the reference pre-dialysis diastolic blood pressure of\u2009\u2265\u200970 to\u2009<\u200980\u00a0mmHg. Cubic spline analyses revealed a reverse J-shaped association between pre-dialysis diastolic blood pressure and intradialytic hypotension.Low and high pre-dialysis diastolic blood pressure levels were associated with intradialytic hypotension. This may help identify patients at a high risk of developing intradialytic hypotension."

    "title": "Using Occupational Histories to Assess Heat Exposure in Undocumented Workers Receiving Emergent Renal Dialysis in Georgia.",
    "content": "Immigrants often work in jobs that are known as dirty, demanding, and dangerous. Globally, the agricultural occupations have been associated with the emergence of chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) primarily in outdoor worker populations. The disease has also been reported in immigrants in the United States who work in agricultural occupations, but little research has been done outside of agricultural workers to determine whether immigrants who work other occupations are at risk for developing CKDu.This study assessed the self-reported occupational histories of undocumented immigrants receiving frequent, emergent-only dialysis in Atlanta, GA. We assessed demographics, employment status, and work history, using the Grady Dialysis Questionnaire and the Occupational/Environmental Health History Form.Fifty undocumented immigrants receiving frequent, emergent-only hemodialysis were recruited for this study. The average age was 49.5 years (<i>SD</i> \u00b1 11.5), and the majority (52%) were female and originated from Mexico (66%). A majority (74%) reported having worked in the past 5 years and 28% reported currently working. A total of 68 unique jobs were reported. In decreasing order of frequency, our sample worked in occupations with documented renal toxicant exposures, such as applying pesticides in landscaping, heat exposure in agriculture, construction, landscaping, and dry cleaning, and lead paint fumes in construction.Occupational histories provide a greater understanding of the exposures and working conditions of those receiving frequent, emergent-only hemodialysis. This exploratory study suggests that further research is needed to investigate and assess whether renal toxicants are associated with occupations with high numbers of undocumented workers.A detailed and thorough occupational history should be conducted from those receiving frequent, emergent-only hemodialysis. Developing continuing education for nursing and medical staff in dialysis centers on taking an occupational history, mandatory State reporting requirements, and hazard communication training for workers should be considered. Collaborations between occupational health professionals, public health authorities, employers, dialysis providers, and clinicians who see undocumented workers is required to understand and develop appropriate prevention measures for this population."

    "title": "Dialysis dose and mortality in haemodialysis: is higher better?",
    "content": "The effect of dialysis dose on mortality remains unsettled. Current guidelines recommend targeting a single-pool Kt/V (spKt/V) at 1.20-1.40 per thrice-weekly dialysis session. However, the optimal dialysis dose remains mostly disputed.In a nationwide registry of all incident patients receiving thrice-weekly haemodialysis, 32\u2009283 patients had available data on dialysis dose, estimated by Kt/V and its variants epuration volume per session (Kt) and Kt indexed to body surface area (Kt/A). Survival was analysed with a multivariate Cox model and a concurrent risk model accounting for renal transplantation. A predictive model of Kt in the upper quartile was developed.Regardless of the indicator, a higher dose of dialysis was consistently associated with better survival. The survival differential of Kt was the most discriminating, but marginally, compared with the survival differential according to Kt/V and Kt/A. Patient survival was higher in the upper quartile of Kt (>69\u2009L/session) then deteriorated as the Kt decreased, with a difference in survival between the upper and lower quartile of 23.6% at 5\u2009years. Survival differences across Kt distribution were similar after accounting for kidney transplantation as a competing risk. Predictive factors for Kt in the upper quartile were arteriovenous fistula versus catheters and graft, haemodiafiltration versus haemodialysis, scheduled dialysis start versus emergency start, long weekly dialysis duration and spKt/V measurement versus double-pool equilibrated Kt/V.Our data confirm the existence of a relationship between dialysis dose and survival that persisted despite correcting for known confounders. A model for predicting a high dose of dialysis is proposed with practical relevance."

    "content": "It is well established that end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality both in the adult and pediatric population. Although the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood, compromised nitric oxide (NO) bioactivity has been suggested as a contributing factor. With this in mind, we investigated the effects of hemodialysis on NO homeostasis and bioactivity in blood.Plasma and dialysate samples were obtained before and after hemodialysis sessions from adults (n\u00a0=\u00a033) and pediatric patients (n\u00a0=\u00a010) with ESRD on chronic renal replacement therapy, and from critically ill adults with acute kidney injury (n\u00a0=\u00a012) at their first sustained low-efficiency dialysis session. Levels of nitrate, nitrite, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and amino acids relevant for NO homeostasis were analyzed. We consistently found that nitrate and cGMP levels in plasma were significantly reduced after hemodialysis, whereas post-dialysis nitrite and amino acids coupled to NO synthase activity (i.e., arginine and citrulline) were only significantly reduced in adults with ESRD. The amount of excreted nitrate and nitrite during dialysis were similar to daily endogenous levels that would be expected from endothelial NO synthase activity.Our results show that hemodialysis significantly reduces circulating levels of nitrate and cGMP, indicating that this medical procedure may impair NO synthesis and potentially NO signaling pathways."

    "content": "We used insurance claims data of Taiwan to compare the risk of non-traumatic lower extremity amputation between haemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients.We identified 77\u00a0669 HD patients and 10\u00a0035 PD patients without prior amputation from 2000 to 2010. Incidence rates and hazard ratios (HRs) of lower extremity amputation, and subsequent 30-day mortality after amputation were evaluated up to 31 December 2011.There were 2427 and 216 patients undergoing lower extremity amputation during follow-up in the HD and PD groups with incidence rates of 8.35 and 5.79 per 1000 person-years, respectively. Compared with the HD group, the overall adjusted HR of lower extremity amputation for the PD group was 1.27 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.10-1.46). The impact of diabetes status on the risk of lower extremity amputation interacted with dialysis modality significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Compared with the corresponding HD patients, the PD patients with diabetes had an adjusted HR of 1.44 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.24-1.67) for amputation, whereas those without diabetes had an adjusted HR of 0.58 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.36-0.95). The subsequent 30-day mortality rates after amputation were not significantly different between the HD and PD groups (8.45% vs. 9.72%) with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.41 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.87-2.28, PD versus HD).Compared with corresponding HD patients, the amputation risk is higher for PD patients with diabetes, while the risk is lower for PD patients without diabetes. Dialysis patients have a high 30-day mortality risk after amputation."

    "content": "This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of haemodialysis (HD), continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in Singapore.A Markov model was developed to examine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of HD, CAPD and APD over the 10-year time horizon from the societal perspective, using clinical data from an observational study and the national renal registry, utilities from published studies and costs from dialysis services providers. The base-case analysis was for a hypothetical cohort of 60-year-old non-diabetic ESRD patients. A high-risk group of 60-year-old diabetic ESRD patients was also studied.In the base-case analysis, the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were 3.27 with CAPD, 3.48 with APD and 4.69 with HD. The total costs were Singapore dollar $169\u2009872 for CAPD, $201\u2009509 for APD and $306\u2009827 for HD. CAPD and HD had extended dominance over APD. The ICER of HD versus CAPD was $96\u2009447 (US$69\u2009121) per QALY. One-way sensitivity analyses indicated that the results were most sensitive to the utility of HD. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that CAPD had the maximum probability of being cost-effective among treatments under evaluation at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $60\u2009000 (US$43\u2009000) per QALY. The high-risk group analyses showed similar results. The ICER of HD versus CAPD was $106\u2009281 (US$76\u2009168) per QALY and the probability of CAPD being optimal was the highest using the same WTP threshold.Our analysis suggested that starting dialysis with CAPD is most cost-effective for ESRD patients in Singapore."

    "title": "Intravascular Renal Denervation in Renal Dialysis Patients with Uncontrolled Hypertension: A Case Series of Four Patients.",
    "content": "BACKGROUND Hypertension is a common complication of renal dialysis and is inadequately controlled in approximately one-third of patients. Intravascular renal denervation is an option to control sympathetic overdrive and decrease blood pressure. Four renal dialysis patients are presented with uncontrolled hypertension who were treated with intravascular renal denervation. CASE REPORT In a renal dialysis unit, patients were screened for therapy-resistant hypertension, which was defined as an outpatient blood pressure >160/100 mmHg and a blood pressure by interdialytic ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) >130/80 mmHg. Four patients were identified with a mean ABPM of 175/95 mmHg. The four patients included a 24-year-old man with neurogenic bladder undergoing hemodialysis; a 55-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus undergoing peritoneal dialysis; a 56-year-old woman with a history of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) undergoing peritoneal dialysis; and a 72-year-old man with a history of ADPKD undergoing hemodialysis Following intravascular renal denervation, one patient had antihypertensive medicines withdrawn at 12 months, and he remained normotensive up to renal transplantation at 24 months. In two patients, ABPM did not decrease until renal transplantation was performed. The fourth patient was not a candidate for renal transplantation, and he was also a non-responder for intravascular renal denervation. None of the patients experienced hypotension or other adverse events following intravascular renal denervation. CONCLUSIONS A case series of four patients showed that, for some patients who have unresponsive hypertension while on renal dialysis, intravascular renal denervation is a safe procedure."

Twenty men aged between 20 and 59 years (<i>Mean<sub>age</sub></i> = 40.65 yrs; <i>SD</i> = 12.52) participated in the study. Participants were recruited purposefully. Data were collected over a period of 4 months through in-depth face-to-face interviews and analyzed using the Interpretative Phenomenological Analytical method. The following three key themes were extracted from the interviews: (a) the emotional pain and fear of death following a diagnosis of ESRD; (b) living on dialysis interferes with the management and handling of \"manly\" responsibilities and duties and, (c) dialysis as a challenging yet life-saving measure. The findings further suggest that renal dialysis has an impact on men's sense of masculinity and has the potential to complicate the management of renal failure. The paper concludes by recommending that cultural and community factors be taken into account when considering interventions to manage the health of men living with renal conditions."

    "content": "To evaluate the effect of haemodialysis on doravirine concentrations in people living with HIV (PLWH) undergoing routine haemodialysis.An exploratory clinical trial that included PLWH undergoing intermittent haemodialysis was undertaken. After enrolment (day 1), doravirine 100\u2005mg once daily was added to stable combined ART for 5\u2005days. On day 6, blood samples were collected from each participant at the beginning and at the end of a dialysis session. Additionally, paired samples of blood entering ('in') and leaving ('out') the dialyser and the resulting dialysate were collected during the dialysis session to evaluate drug removal during dialysis. Doravirine concentrations in plasma and in the dialysate were determined by LC-MS/MS. The ratio of doravirine concentrations in plasma after/before the haemodialysis session and the haemodialysis extraction coefficient were calculated for each participant. The study was registered at https://www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04689737).Eight participants (six male) were included. The median (range) age and BMI were 49.5 (28-67) years and 23.6 (17.9-34.2) kg/m2, respectively. The doravirine dialysis extraction ratio was 34.3% (25.8%-41.4%). The ratio of doravirine concentrations in plasma after/before the haemodialysis session was 0.8 (0.6-1.0). At the end of the haemodialysis session (time post-dose 20.8-27.3\u2005h), doravirine concentrations in plasma were 785 (101-1851) ng/mL.Despite moderate removal of doravirine by haemodialysis, trough doravirine concentrations in plasma after the haemodialysis sessions remained in excess of the protein-binding-adjusted EC50 (5\u2005ng/mL). Doravirine dosage adjustments are unnecessary in PLWH undergoing intermittent haemodialysis."

A total of 12 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 932 participants were collected.Meta-analysis results suggested that comparing with peritoneal dialysis group, hemodialysis group had a higher incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and bleeding complications. There was no statistically significant difference regarding the infection (P\u2009=\u20090.71) or malnutrition (P\u2009=\u20090.53) incidence between the two forms of dialysis. Hemodialysis could better improve the levels of albumin [mean difference (MD)\u2009=\u20096.80, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009(4.17-9.44)] and hemoglobin [MD\u2009=\u20093.40, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009(0.94-5.86)] than peritoneal dialysis after 3\u00a0months or more.In treating end-stage diabetic nephropathy patients, peritoneal dialysis had a lower incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, as well as bleeding complication than hemodialysis.

    "content": "Kidney failure prevalence is increasing worldwide. Haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis or kidney transplantation are undertaken to extend life with kidney failure. People receiving haemodialysis commonly experience fatigue, pain, nausea, cramping, itching, sleeping difficulties, anxiety and depression. This symptom burden contributes to poor health-related quality of life (QOL) and is a major reason for treatment withdrawal and death. The Symptom monitoring WIth Feedback Trial (SWIFT) will test the hypothesis that regular symptom monitoring with feedback to people receiving haemodialysis and their treating clinical team can improve QOL.We are conducting an Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant (ANZDATA) registry-based cluster randomised controlled trial to determine the clinical- and cost-effectiveness at 12 months, of 3-monthly symptom monitoring using the Integrated Palliative Outcome Scale-Renal (IPOS-Renal) survey with clinician feedback, compared with usual care among adults treated with haemodialysis. Participants complete symptom scoring using a tablet, which are provided to participants and to clinicians. The trial aims to recruit 143 satellite haemodialysis centres, (up to 2400 participants). The primary outcome is change in health-related QOL, as measured by EuroQol 5-Dimension, 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) instrument. Secondary outcomes include overall survival, symptom severity (including haemodialysis-associated fatigue), healthcare utilisation and cost-effectiveness.SWIFT is the first registry-based trial in the Australian haemodialysis population to investigate whether regular symptom monitoring with feedback to participants and clinicians improves QOL. SWIFT is embedded in the ANZDATA Registry facilitating pragmatic recruitment from public and private dialysis clinics, throughout Australia. SWIFT will inform future collection, storage and reporting of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) within a clinical quality registry. As the first trial to rigorously estimate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of routine PROMs collection and reporting in haemodialysis units, SWIFT will provide invaluable information to health services, clinicians and researchers working to improve the lives of those with kidney failure.Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12620001061921 .

    "title": "End Stage Renal Disease among Patients Undergoing Haemodialysis at a Tertiary Care Centre: A Descriptive Cross-sectional Study.",
    "content": "Chronic kidney disease is defined as structural or functional damage of the kidney persisting for three or more months. Studies have shown hypertension and diabetes as the leading causes of chronic kidney disease. The aim of this study is to find out the prevalence of end-stage renal disease patients undergoing haemodialysis in a tertiary care hospital.This was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted among 96 patients undergoing haemodialysis from February 13, 2021 to April 4, 2021 in the hemodialysis unit of a tertiary care centre after receiving ethical clearance from the Institutional Review Committee (Reference number: 354). Convenience sampling was done and all patients older than 18 years who were on maintenance haemodialysis on an outpatient basis were included in the study. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Data were analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Science version 22.0. Point estimate at 95% Confidence Interval was calculated along with frequency and percentages for binary data and mean with standard deviation for continuous data.Among 96 patients undergoing haemodialysis, the prevalence of end-stage renal disease was 83 (86.45%) (79.60-93.30 at 95% Confidence Interval). The most common underlying condition was hypertensive nephropathy in 34 (40.96%) patients, followed by both hypertensive and diabetic nephropathy in 26 (31.33%) patients.The prevalence of end-stage renal disease in our study was higher when compared to similar studies conducted in similar settings. Early diagnosis and adequate treatment of hypertension and diabetes could be crucial to reducing the prevalence of the end-stage renal disease.chronic kidney failure; chronic renal insufficiency; end stage renal disease; hemodialysis; Nepal."

    "title": "Urgent-start peritoneal dialysis versus haemodialysis for people with chronic kidney disease.",
    "content": "Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who require urgent initiation of dialysis but without having a permanent dialysis access have traditionally commenced haemodialysis (HD) using a central venous catheter (CVC). However, several studies have reported that urgent initiation of peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a viable alternative option for such patients.This review aimed to examine the benefits and harms of urgent-start PD compared to HD initiated using a CVC in adults and children with CKD requiring long-term kidney replacement therapy.We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 25 May 2020 for randomised controlled trials through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. For non-randomised controlled trials, MEDLINE (OVID) (1946 to 11 February 2020) and EMBASE (OVID) (1980 to 11 February 2020) were searched.All randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and non-RCTs comparing urgent-start PD to HD initiated using a CVC.Two authors extracted data and assessed the quality of studies independently. Additional information was obtained from the primary investigators. The estimates of effect were analysed using random-effects model and results were presented as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The GRADE framework was used to make judgments regarding certainty of the evidence for each outcome.Overall, seven observational studies (991 participants) were included: three prospective cohort studies and four retrospective cohort studies. All the outcomes except one (bacteraemia) were graded as very low certainty of evidence given that all included studies were observational studies and few events resulting in imprecision, and inconsistent findings. Urgent-start PD may reduce the incidence of catheter-related bacteraemia compared with HD initiated with a CVC (2 studies, 301 participants: RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.41; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; low certainty evidence), which translated into 131 fewer bacteraemia episodes per 1000 (95% CI 89 to 145 fewer). Urgent-start PD has uncertain effects on peritonitis risk (2 studies, 301 participants: RR 1.78, 95% CI 0.23 to 13.62; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; very low certainty evidence), exit-site/tunnel infection (1 study, 419 participants: RR 3.99, 95% CI 1.2 to 12.05; very low certainty evidence), exit-site bleeding (1 study, 178 participants: RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.33; very low certainty evidence), catheter malfunction (2 studies; 597 participants: RR 0.26, 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.91; I<sup>2</sup> = 66%; very low certainty evidence), catheter re-adjustment (2 studies, 225 participants: RR: 0.13; 95% CI 0.00 to 18.61; I<sup>2</sup> = 92%; very low certainty evidence), technique survival (1 study, 123 participants: RR: 1.18, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.61; very low certainty evidence), or patient survival (5 studies, 820 participants; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.07; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; very low certainty evidence) compared with HD initiated using a CVC. Two studies using different methods of measurements for hospitalisation reported that hospitalisation was similar although one study reported higher hospitalisation rates in HD initiated using a catheter compared with urgent-start PD.Compared with HD initiated using a CVC, urgent-start PD may reduce the risk of bacteraemia and had uncertain effects on other complications of dialysis and technique and patient survival. In summary, there are very few studies directly comparing the outcomes of urgent-start PD and HD initiated using a CVC for patients with CKD who need to commence dialysis urgently. This evidence gap needs to be addressed in future studies."

    "content": "Despite national descriptions of awareness, knowledge, and perceptions about the exposure to the biological risk among nurses employed in renal-dialysis care are pivotal to increase work safety, there is a paucity of data on these descriptions in the Italian context. This study aimed at describing Italian nurses' awareness and knowledge about biological risk in delivering care for renal-dialysis patients, and their experiences of biological accidents.A pilot survey using cross-sectional data collection and convenience sampling procedure. 124 nurses were enrolled receiving a 7-item questionnaire: Questions 1, 2, and 7 were referred to the awareness about educational learning needs, questions 3 and 4 explored nurses' knowledge about biological risk, questions 5 and 6 collected accident-related information.Overall, nurses' awareness and knowledge about biological risk appeared almost limited. Surprisingly, 52% of the enrolled nurses experienced a biological accident, and 29.5% reported to know colleagues who developed work-related disease after a biological accident. We found positive significant associations between awareness and knowledge.This pilot study highlighted the need to further describe Italian nurses' awareness and knowledge about biological risk in delivering care for renal-dialysis patients, as well as the need of up-to-date epidemiological description about biological accidents. Accordingly, future studies are highly recommended to provide robust evidence aimed at supporting policy makers, educators, clinicians, regulators, and managers."

    "content": "Although high-volume online hemodiafiltration has been associated with higher clearance and lower pre-dialysis concentration of middle molecular weight toxins compared to hemodialysis, its effect on protein-bound uremic toxins has shown inconclusive results. In this study, we investigated whether hemodiafiltration impacts pre-dialysis plasma levels of the toxins indoxyl sulfate, p-cresyl sulfate, and indole-3-acetic acid compared to high-flux hemodialysis.This is a post-hoc analysis of the multicenter, randomized controlled trial HDFit (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02787161). Uremic toxins were determined by high performance liquid chromatography at baseline, 3, and 6\u00a0months. Mean differences in monthly changes of pre-dialysis uremic toxin concentrations between hemodiafiltration and high-flux hemodialysis were analyzed using linear mixed-effect models.One hundred ninety-three patients (mean age 53\u00a0years old, 71% males) were analyzed. There were no differences between groups regarding clinical and biochemical characteristics at baseline or duration of dialysis session and blood flows throughout the follow-up. Mean differences in rates of change (\u03bcM/month, [confidence interval CI]) in high-flux hemodialysis vs. hemodiafiltration were 2.4 [0.3 to 4.56], 3.94 [-\u20091.54 to 9.41] and 0.06 [-\u20090.6 to 0.5] for indoxyl sulfate, p-cresyl sulfate and indole-3-acetic acid, respectively. In the exploratory analysis, these differences in high-flux hemodialysis vs. hemodiafiltration subgroup with convective volume\u2009>\u200927.5\u00a0L were 2.86 [0.43 to 5.28], 7.43 [0.7 to 14.16] and -\u20090.19 [-\u20090.88 to 0.50].These exploratory findings suggest that hemodiafiltration is more effective in reducing indoxyl sulfate as compared to standard high-flux hemodialysis, and also that this effect was extended to p-cresyl sulfate in patients achieving higher convective volumes."

    "content": "To evaluate the physicochemical and microbiological quality of dialysis water and dialysate samples from haemodialysis centres.Samples were fortnightly collected from three haemodialysis centres in Bauru City, Brazil, between July 2017 and June 2018, at the stages of post-reverse osmosis, reuse and dialysate. Analyses included determination of conductivity, fluoride, nitrate and sulphate; test for total coliform bacteria; count of heterotrophic bacteria; count and identification of non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli (NFGNB); drug susceptibility test; biofilm formation capacity; and genetic similarity among some isolated NFGNB. Of the analysed samples, only 4/72 (5.6%) had conductivity values \u226510 mS/cm, 4/216 (1.9%) presented total coliforms and 1/216 (0.5%) had heterotrophic bacteria count >100\u00a0CFU/ml. NFGNB were isolated from 99/216 (45.8%) samples, and the major identified micro-organisms included Herbaspirillum aquaticum/huttiense, Brevundimonas aurantiaca, Cupriavidus metallidurans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Ralstonia insidiosa. Isolates of P. aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia complex were sensitive to most antimicrobials and, together with isolates of Ralstonia insidiosa and Ralstonia pickettii, showed strong biofilm formation capacity. Some isolates expressed the same electrophoretic profile on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, indicating the persistence of bacterial clones in the systems over time.NFGNB were observed in several dialysis water and dialysate samples from all investigated centres, which may represent a risk to the health of patients.Regular inclusion of actions for NFGNB control and monitoring in haemodialysis fluids are suggested for greater safety of the dialytic process."

    "title": "Vascular access in children requiring maintenance haemodialysis: a consensus document by the European Society for Paediatric Nephrology Dialysis Working Group.",
    "content": "There are three principle forms of vascular access available for the treatment of children with end stage kidney disease (ESKD) by haemodialysis: tunnelled catheters placed in a central vein (central venous lines, CVLs), arteriovenous fistulas (AVF), and arteriovenous grafts (AVG) using prosthetic or biological material. Compared with the adult literature, there are few studies in children to provide evidence based guidelines for optimal vascular access type or its management and outcomes in children with ESKD.The European Society for Paediatric Nephrology Dialysis Working Group (ESPN Dialysis WG) have developed recommendations for the choice of access type, pre-operative evaluation, monitoring, and prevention and management of complications of different access types in children with ESKD.For adults with ESKD on haemodialysis, the principle of \"Fistula First\" has been key to changing the attitude to vascular access for haemodialysis. However, data from multiple observational studies and the International Paediatric Haemodialysis Network registry suggest that CVLs are associated with a significantly higher rate of infections and access dysfunction, and need for access replacement. Despite this, AVFs are used in only \u223c25% of children on haemodialysis. It is important to provide the right access for the right patient at the right time in their life-course of renal replacement therapy, with an emphasis on venous preservation at all times. While AVFs may not be suitable in the very young or those with an anticipated short dialysis course before transplantation, many paediatric studies have shown that AVFs are superior to CVLs.Here we present clinical practice recommendations for AVFs and CVLs in children with ESKD. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system has been used to develop and GRADE the recommendations. In the absence of high quality evidence, the opinion of experts from the ESPN Dialysis WG is provided, but is clearly GRADE-ed as such and must be carefully considered by the treating physician, and adapted to local expertise and individual patient needs as appropriate."

    "content": "Haemodialysis patients experience significant symptom burden and effects on health-related quality of life. Studies have shown increases in fluid overload, hospitalization and mortality immediately after the long interdialytic interval in thrice weekly in-centre haemodialysis patients, however the relationship between the dialytic interval and patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) has not been quantified and the extent to which dialysis day of PROM completion needs to be standardised is unknown.Three times a week haemodialysis patients participating in a stepped wedge trial to increase patient participation in haemodialysis tasks completed PROMs (POS-S Renal symptom score and EQ-5D-5L) at recruitment, six, 12 and 18 months. Time from the long interdialytic interval, HD day of the week, and HD days vs non-HD days were included in mixed effects Linear Regression, estimating severity (none to overwhelming treated as 0 to 4) of 17 symptoms and EQ-5D-5L, adjusting for age, sex, time on HD, control versus intervention and Charlson Comorbidity Score.517 patients completed 1659 YHS questionnaires that could be assigned HD day (510 on Mon/Tue/Sun, 549 on Wed/Thu/Tue, 308 on Fri/Sat/Thu and 269 on non-HD days). With the exception of restless legs and skin changes, there was no statistically significant change in symptom severity or EQ-5D-5L with increasing time from the long interdialytic interval. Patients who responded on non-HD days had higher severity of poor appetite, constipation, difficulty sleeping, poor mobility and depression (approximately 0.2 severity level), and lower EQ-5D-5L (-0.06, CI -0.09 to -0.03) compared to HD days.Measuring symptom severity and EQ-5D-5L in haemodialysis populations does not need to account for dialysis schedule, but completion either on HD or non-HD days could introduce bias that may impact evaluation of interventions. Researchers should ensure completion of these instruments are standardized on either dialysis or non-dialysis days."

The two SENV types, SENV-H and SENV-D, are non-A to E hepatitis viruses \u00a0in those who are infected. The purpose of this study is to find out how common SENV and its variations are among renal dialysis patients and healthy blood donors.The study used a cross-sectional design, with 300 blood samples collected from KFMMC patients, 150 from healthy blood donors and 150 from renal dialysis patients, between January 2019 and January 2021. The samples were screened for the presence of SENV-D and\u00a0SENV-H.\u00a0using nested PCR.Molecular analysis of the SEN virus revealed that 9.3% of the samples (14 out of 150) tested positive for SEN virus infection in renal dialysis patients. The data from healthy donors revealed that 10% of the samples tested positive for the SEN virus (15 out of 150).The presence of SEN-V in healthy blood donors and renal dialysis patients demonstrates the virus's blood-borne nature and emphasizes the dangers of blood-borne transmission."

    "content": "Few studies have evaluated the viability and outcomes between peritoneal dialysis (PD) and haemodialysis (HD) in urgent-start renal replacement therapy (RRT). This study aimed to compare infectious and mechanical complications related to urgent-start PD and HD. Secondary outcomes were to identify risk factors for complications and mortality related to urgent-start dialysis.A quasi-experimental study with incident patients receiving PD and HD in a Brazilian university hospital, between July 2014 and December 2017. Subjects included individuals with final-stage chronic kidney disease who required immediate RRT, that is, HD through central venous catheter or PD in which the catheter was implanted by a nephrologist and utilized for 72 h, without previous training. Patients with PD were subjected, initially, to high-volume PD for metabolic compensation. After hospital discharge, they remained in intermittent PD in the dialysis unit until training was completed. Mechanical and infectious complications were compared, as well as the recovery of renal function and survival.In total, 93 patients were included in PD and 91 in HD. PD and HD groups were similar regarding age (58\u2009\u00b1\u200917 vs. 60\u2009\u00b1\u200915 years; <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.49), frequency of diabetes mellitus (37.6% vs. 50.5%; <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.10), other comorbidities (74.1% vs. 71.4%; <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.67) and biochemical parameters at the beginning of RRT, that is, creatinine (9.1\u2009\u00b1\u20094.1 vs. 8.0\u2009\u00b1\u20092.8; <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.09), serum albumin (3.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6 vs. 3.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6; <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.06) and haemoglobin (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 vs. 9.8 \u00b1 2.0; <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.44). After a minimum follow-up period of 180 days and a maximum follow-up period of 2 years, there was no difference regarding mechanical complications (24.7% vs. 37.4%; <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.06) or bacteraemia (15.0% vs. 24.0%; <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.11); however, there was a difference regarding infection of the exit site (25.8% vs. 39.5%; <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.04) and diuresis maintenance [700 (0-1500) vs. 0 (0-500); <i>p</i> < 0.001], with better results in the PD group. There was better phosphorus control at 180 days in the PD group (62.4% vs. 41.8%; <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.008), with a lower requirement for phosphate binder usage (28% vs. 55%; <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001), erythropoietin (18.3% vs. 49.5%; <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001) and anti-hypertensives (11.8% vs. 30.8%; <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.003). Time to death was similar between groups. In the multivariate analysis, PD was a predictor of renal function recovery [odds ratio: 3.95 (1.01-15.4)].PD is a viable and safe alternative to HD in a scenario of urgent-start RRT with complication rates and outcomes similar to those of HD, highlighting the results regarding renal function recovery."

    "title": "Initiating renal replacement therapy through incremental haemodialysis: Protocol for a randomized multicentre clinical trial.",
    "content": "Thrice-weekly haemodialysis is the usual dose when starting renal replacement therapy; however, this schedule is no longer appropriate since it does not consider residual renal function. Several reports have suggested the potential benefit of beginning haemodialysis less frequently and incrementally increasing the dose as the residual renal function decreases. However, all the data published so far are from observational studies. Thus, this clinical trial avoids any potential selection bias and will assess the possible benefits that have been observed in observational studies.This report describes the study protocol of a randomized prospective multi-centre open-label clinical trial to evaluate whether starting renal replacement therapy with twice-weekly haemodialysis sessions preserves residual renal function better than the standard thrice-weekly regimen. We also explore other clinical parameters, such as concentrations of uremic toxins, dialysis doses, control of anaemia, removal of medium-weight uremic toxins, nutritional status, quality of life, hospital admissions and mortality. Only incident haemodialysis patients who can maintain a urea clearance rate KrU \u2265 2.5\u2009mL/min/1.73\u2009m<sup>2</sup> are eligible. Patient recruitment began on 1 January 2017 and will last for 2 years or until the required sample size has been recruited to ensure the established statistical power has been reached. The minimum follow-up period will be 1 year. Anuric patients with acute renal failure and patients who return to haemodialysis after a kidney transplant failure are excluded. It has been calculated that 44 patients should be recruited into each group to achieve a power of 80% in a two-sided comparison of means with a usual significance level of 0.05. A time-to-event analysis will estimate the probability of kidney function survival in both groups using the Kaplan-Meier method. Survival curves will be compared with log-rank tests. This survival analysis will be complemented with a proportional hazard model to estimate the hazard ratio of kidney function survival adjusted for any confounding factors. Analyses will be carried out in accordance with the intention-to-treat principle.The incremental initiation of dialysis may preserve residual renal function better than the conventional treatment, with similar or higher survival rates, as reported by observational studies. To our knowledge, this is the first clinical trial to evaluate whether initiating renal replacement therapy with twice-weekly haemodialysis sessions preserves residual renal function better than beginning with the standard thrice-weekly regimen.ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03302546.

    "content": "Although the clearance of low-molecular weight toxins is modulated by dialysis dose, the relationship between dialysis adequacy and middle systemic inflammatory mediators is often overlooked. Thus, the relationship between dialysis adequacy, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in hemodialysis (HD) patients was investigated. Forty-eight HD patients (19 women and 25 men) were investigated. Age, body mass index, time in HD, nutritional status, Kt/V and blood biochemical parameters was similar in patients of both sexes (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Thus, patients were stratified by dialysis adequacy measured by Kt/V method (adequate Kt/V\u00a0\u2265\u00a01.2). Post-HD urea, creatinine, cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, IL-4 and IL-10) and chemokines (CCL-2, CCL-5, CXCL-8 and CXCL-10) were higher in patients with Kt/V\u00a0<\u00a01.2 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Kt/V exhibited significant correlation with CXCL-10/IP-10 serum levels. Positive correlation between creatinine with IFN-\u03b3, CCL-2/MCP-1, and CXCL-10/IP-10, and negative correlation with IL-10 was identified in patients with Kt/V\u00a0<\u00a01.2 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In patients with Kt/V\u00a0\u2265\u00a01.2, only IL-10 was positively and CXCL-10/IP-10 negatively correlated with creatinine levels (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Kt/V and creatinine levels exhibited variable predictive value (Kt/V\u00a0=\u00a027% to 37%, creatinine\u00a0=\u00a029% to 47%) to explain cytokines and chemokines circulating levels in patients with adequate and inadequate dialysis dose. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that in addition to modulating uremic toxins levels, such as urea and creatinine, dialysis dose is associated with circulating levels of inflammatory mediators. Thus, low Kt/V results and creatinine accumulation are potential indicators of the systemic inflammatory stress determined by up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and downregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines."

Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curve was performed for survival time.Serum level of HMGB1 in patients on HD was higher than PD. HMGB1 levels were gradually decreased with the treatment of HD or PD. Furthermore, HMGB1 was positively correlated with IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1. Moreover, patients with higher HMGB1 had more complications than patients with lower HMGB1, but there was no difference for the survival rate. In addition, the quality of life was associated with different dialysis methods.The serum level of HMGB1 and prognosis of ESRD patients was associated with different dialysis methods."

    "content": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasingly recognised as an important cause of morbidity and mortality in South Africa (SA). Although the cost of dialysis is well documented in developed countries, little is known about this cost in sub-Saharan Africa.To review the costs of providing peritoneal dialysis (PD) and haemodialysis (HD) at the Pietersburg renal dialysis public-private partnership (PPP) unit in Limpopo Province, SA.A retrospective review of the cost of inputs required for HD and PD was conducted from a provider's perspective, covering the period 2007 - 2012. A top-down approach was used to estimate the average annual cost per patient on HD and PD.During the 6-year period under review, the number of patients on dialysis increased from 77 in 2007 to 182 in 2012. More than 60% of the patients were on HD. The average annual cost per patient was estimated to be ZAR212 286 (USD25 888) and ZAR255 076 (USD31\u00a0106) for HD and PD, respectively, in 2012. Personnel cost, PD supplies, HD supplies, the outsourcing fee and pharmaceutical supplies were the main cost drivers. PD proved to be more expensive than HD, despite the use of locally manufactured fluids.The study highlights the exceptionally high cost of dialysis treatment. Dialysis should be made more accessible by implementing measures to address the main cost drivers. Moreover, a comprehensive approach that includes prevention of CKD at primary healthcare level, an organ donation programme and an effective kidney transplant programme is urgently required in Limpopo. Further research is required to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the PPP approach."

Thematic analysis was utilised to analyse the data.Thematic analysis identified four main themes which are perspectives of mental Illness, patient and staff safety concerns, facilitators of care and education and support needs.Renal nurses experienced difficulty managing challenging behaviours manifested by patients with severe mental illness. Despite the various challenges, renal nurses adopted a person-centred approach. Staff shortages and lack of training were significant hindrances to care delivery. Education on mental health conditions, support from senior staff and collaborative working can enable confidence and increase renal nurses' knowledge and experience in mental health care."

The aim of the present study is to analyse the long-term effects of HHD on patient survival and on subsequent renal transplantation, compared with institutional hemodialysis (IHD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD), taking age and comorbidity into account.Patients starting HHD as initial renal replacement therapy (RRT) were matched with patients on IHD or PD, according to gender, age, Charlson Comorbidity Index and start date of RRT, using the Swedish Renal Registry from 1991 to 2012. Survival analyses were performed as intention-to-treat (disregarding changes in RRT) and per-protocol (as on initial RRT).A total of 152 patients with HHD as initial RRT were matched with 608 IHD and 456 PD patients, respectively. Median survival was longer for HHD in intention-to-treat analyses: 18.5\u2009years compared with 11.9 for IHD (p\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.001) and 15.0 for PD (p\u2009=\u20090.002). The difference remained significant in per-protocol analyses omitting the contribution of subsequent transplantation. Patients on HHD were more likely to receive a renal transplant compared with IHD and PD, although treatment modality did not affect subsequent graft survival (p\u2009>\u20090.05).HHD as initial RRT showed improved long-term patient survival compared with IHD and PD. This survival advantage persisted after matching and adjusting for a higher transplantation rate. Dialysis modality had no impact on subsequent graft survival."

    "content": "End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a chronic disease that can adversely affect the patient's quality of life (QoL) in terms of functional limitation and cognitive impairment. This study aimed to identify the factors associated with QoL in patients with ESRD undergoing dialysis at a national hospital in Vietnam.A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among outpatients aged \u226518\u00a0years who underwent haemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) for at least 3\u00a0months at Thong Nhat Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam from May 2020 to July 2021. QoL was measured using the validated Vietnamese version of the EuroQol-5 Dimensional-5 Level (EQ-5D-5L). The factors associated with the QoL of patients with ESRD undergoing dialysis were identified using multiple linear regression analysis.In total, 131 (73.6%) and 47 (26.4%) patients underwent HD and PD, respectively. Overall, 178 (55.6%) patients were men (median age, 66 [56-79] years). The mean EQ-5D-5L score was significantly higher in patients undergoing PD than in those undergoing HD (0.848\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.183 vs. 0.766\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.231; p\u00a0=\u00a00.030). Older age (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.006; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and peptic ulcer disease (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.083; p\u00a0=\u00a00.029) were associated with lower QoL scores. PD treatment was associated with higher QoL scores (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.065; p\u00a0=\u00a00.046).It is necessary to improve the QoL of patients undergoing dialysis, especially of elderly patients and patients with peptic ulcer disease. PD may be a better method for maintenance dialysis, if applicable, in terms of QoL."

The current study aims to describe and compare ESRD patients' QOL according to dialysis modalities (hemodialysis [HD] and peritoneal dialysis [PD]).This is a cross-sectional study, conducted in dialysis facilities of a Moroccan university hospital, during October 2018. All adult ESRD patients, treated either by HD or PD for more than 3\u2009months and agreeing to participate, were included. Medical data were collected using a questionnaire, whereas the QOL data were collected using the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form (KDQOL SF v 1.3) scale previously validated in dialectal Arabic. The patients' characteristics and QOL data were compared between dialysis modalities (HD vs. PD), using a linear regression, before and after adjustment on several demographic and medical factors as well as a propensity score created to reduce the effect of confounding factors related to the choice of the treatment.Out of the 91 included patients (50.5% of men, median age 52.0 (IQR [36.5; 62.0]) years), 71 were on HD and 20 were on PD. The highest subscale score, for all participants, was the social support's one with a median of 83.3 (IQR [66.7; 100]), and the lowest one was the kidney disease burden with a median of 25.0 (IQR [0.00; 46.9]). The univariate analysis showed that the Physical Component Score (PCS), the cognitive function, and the dialysis staff encouragement were better in PD patients (p\u2009=\u20090.03, p\u2009=\u20090.04, and p\u2009=\u20090.007, respectively), while the multiple linear regression indicates that the PCS, the dialysis Staff encouragement, and the patient's satisfaction subscores decreased within patients on HD compared with those on PD (p\u2009=\u20090.01, p\u2009=\u20090.03, and p\u2009=\u20090.02, respectively) and that the burden of the kidney disease and the work status subscores increased within patients on HD against those on PD (p\u2009=\u20090.007 and p\u2009=\u20090.04, respectively).This study showed a significant difference between dialysis modalities in some sides of quality of life."

    "content": "Residual renal function (RRF) is an important determinant of mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Different dialysis types may have different effects on RRF. We therefore conducted this meta-analysis to examine the RRF protective effect of different dialysis types for hemodialysis patients.A systematic search was performed on PubMed, EMbase, Web of Science, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Wanfang database, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure for randomized controlled trials and cohort studies. Dialysis types included low-flux hemodialysis (LFHD), high-flux hemodialysis (HFHD), hemodiafiltration (HDF), and hemodialysis and hemoperfusion (HD+HP). The mean of endogenous creatinine clearance rate (CCR) and urea clearance rate (Curea), or urine volume was used to estimate RRF [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 6.05-16.80].There were 12 articles involving 1224 patients, including 11 random controlled trials and 1 cohort study. Meta-analysis showed that the RRF protective effect of HFHD [mean difference (MD)\u200a=\u200a1.48, 95% CI (2.11 to 0.86), P\u200a<\u200a.01] and HD+HP [MD\u200a=\u200a0.41, 95% CI (0.69 to 0.12), P\u200a=\u200a.005] was better than that of LFHD, and the RRF decline rate was the lowest in HFHD group [MD\u200a=\u200a0.13, 95% CI (0.17 to 0.09), P\u200a<\u200a.01]. Descriptive analysis showed that HDF could better protect RRF when compared with LFHD. However, there was no consistency among other interventions when removing LFHD due to limited data.For patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis, the HFHD, HD+HP and HDF may better protect RRF, compared with LFHD."

    "content": "More than a third of the 65,000 people living with kidney failure in the UK attend a dialysis unit 2-5 times a week to have their blood cleaned for 3-5 h. In haemodialysis (HD), toxins are removed by diffusion, which can be enhanced using a high-flux dialyser. This can be augmented with convection, as occurs in haemodiafiltration (HDF), and improved outcomes have been reported in people who are able to achieve high volumes of convection. This study compares the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of high-volume HDF compared with high-flux HD in the treatment of kidney failure.This is a UK-based, multi-centre, non-blinded randomised controlled trial. Adult patients already receiving HD or HDF will be randomised 1:1 to high-volume HDF (aiming for 21+ L of substitution fluid adjusted for body surface area) or high-flux HD. Exclusion criteria include lack of capacity to consent, life expectancy less than 3 months, on HD/HDF for less than 4 weeks, planned living kidney donor transplant or home dialysis scheduled within 3 months, prior intolerance of HDF and not suitable for high-volume HDF for other clinical reasons. The primary outcome is a composite of non-cancer mortality or hospital admission with a cardiovascular event or infection during follow-up (minimum 32 months, maximum 91 months) determined from routine data. Secondary outcomes include all-cause mortality, cardiovascular- and infection-related morbidity and mortality, health-related quality of life, cost-effectiveness and environmental impact. Baseline data will be collected by research personnel on-site. Follow-up data will be collected by linkage to routine healthcare databases - Hospital Episode Statistics, Civil Registration, Public Health England and the UK Renal Registry (UKRR) in England, and equivalent databases in Scotland and Wales, as necessary - and centrally administered patient-completed questionnaires. In addition, research personnel on-site will monitor for adverse events and collect data on adherence to the protocol (monthly during recruitment and quarterly during follow-up).This study will provide evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of HD as compared to HDF for adults with kidney failure in-centre HD or HDF. It will inform management for this patient group in the UK and internationally.ISRCTN10997319 . Registered on 10 October 2017."

Quality of life (QOL) among hemodialysis patients is strongly associated with higher risk of death. This study aimed to describe the health-related QOL and its change in older maintenance hemodialysis patients and to demonstrate characteristics associated with health-related QOL.Data on 892 maintenance hemodialysis patients aged 60 years or older who were surveyed using the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form at baseline and 2 years after study enrollment in phases 4 (2009-2011) and 5 (2012-2014) of the Japanese Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study were analyzed. We categorized participants into 3 age groups (60-69, 70-79, and \u226580 years) and described baseline physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores, as well as their distribution of changes after 2 years across each category.Hemodialysis patients aged 70-79 years and \u226580 years had lower PCS scores than those aged 60-69 years (median: 70-79 years = 43.1; interquartile range [IQR], 35.2-49.4; \u226580 years = 38.8; IQR, 31.6-43.8; 60-69 years = 45.4; IQR, 37.5-51.4; p < 0.001).

As dialysis vintage lengthened, the PCS score significantly became lower, whereas no association was found with change in the MCS score. The MCS score declined over time in older patients, especially among those aged 80 years and older after 2 years' follow-up.Physical QOL became worse as dialysis vintage lengthened.

However, it remains unclear whether changes in gut microbiota of dialysis ESRD patients result from dialysis or ESRD, or both. Similarly, there is a dearth of information on the relationship between gut microbiota and ESRD prognoses. We collected fecal samples and tracked clinical outcomes from 73 ESRD patients, including 33 pre-dialysis ESRD patients, 19 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, and 21 hemodialysis (HD) patients. 16S rRNA sequencing and bioinformatics tools were used to analyze the gut microbiota of ESRD patients and healthy controls. Gut microbiota diversity was different before and after dialysis. Bacteroidetes were significantly deceased in HD patients. Twelve bacterial genera exhibited statistically significant differences, due to dialysis (all <i>P</i> < 0.05, FDR corrected). HD reversed abnormal changes in <i>Oscillospira</i> and <i>SMB53</i> in pre-dialysis patients. Functional predictions of microbial communities showed that PD and HD altered signal transduction and metabolic pathways in ESRD patients. Furthermore, <i>Bacteroides</i> and <i>Phascolarctobacterium</i> were associated with cardiovascular mortality. <i>Dorea</i>, <i>Clostridium</i>, and <i>SMB53</i> were related to peritonitis in PD patients. This study not only demonstrated differences in gut microbiota between pre-dialysis and dialysis ESRD patients, but also firstly proposed gut bacteria may exert an impact on patient prognosis."

This study was aimed to compare the risks of lupus flares, all-cause infections, all-cause cardiovascular events, and mortality, between hemodialysis versus peritoneal dialysis as initial RRT - modality before renal-transplant in LN-ESRD patients, by systematic review and meta-analysis.PubMed, EMBASE, and SCOPUS were searched for observational-studies comparing LN-ESRD -patients undergoing hemodialysis (Group1) versus peritoneal-dialysis (Group 2) prior to renal-transplantation, by their risks of lupus flare, all-cause infections, all-cause cardiovascular events, and mortality as outcome measures. Relative-Risks of outcomes between the groups measured overall effects at a 95% significance level. RevMan 5.3 computer software was used for analysis.From search, 16 eligible studies reported 15,636 LN-ESRD -patients prior to renal transplantation with 4616 patients on hemodialysis, 2089 on peritoneal dialysis, 280 directly underwent kidney transplantation, 8319 were eliminated with reasons and 332 participants' details were not reported.

    "content": "Plant phenols may accumulate in end-stage kidney disease. The effect of hemodialysis on their plasma concentration remains poorly determined. Contingent on concentration, health-promoting or noxious effects occur; therefore, we assessed plasma concentration in hemodialyzed patients. In total, 21 maintenance hemodialyzed patients with diuresis < 500 mL per day (with oliguria), nine hemodialyzed patients with diuresis \u2265 500 mL per day (without oliguria) and 31 healthy volunteers were included. Nine phenolic acids were identified with high-performance liquid chromatography and total polyphenol concentration was determined with the Folin-Ciocalteu method in pre- or post-hemodialysis plasma and pre- or intra-hemodialysis dialysate. The concentration of total polyphenols was 27% higher in pre-hemodialysis plasma than in that of controls (0.95 \u00b1 0.18 mmol/L [P < 0.0001]). The concentration of total polyphenols was higher in patients with oliguria (1.01 \u00b1 0.17) than in those without (0.84 \u00b1 0.13 mmol/L), despite the former having more intense hemodialysis (Kt/V 1.29 \u00b1 0.31 and 0.77 \u00b1 0.25, respectively). Pre-hemodialysis phenolic acid concentration in patients undergoing dialysis exceeded reference values by 3 to 34 times (3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and vanillic acid, respectively), from 0.69 (dihydrocaffeic acid) to 169.3 \u03bcmol/L (hippuric acid). The concentration of six phenolic acids (3-hydroxyhippuric, caffeic, dihydrocaffeic, hippuric, homovanillic, and vanillic acid) was 1.1 (homovanillic) to 11.3 (3-hydroxyhippuric) times higher in patients with oliguria than in those without. 4-hydroxyhippuric acid occurred more in the plasma of patients with oliguria than in those without oliguria. A single hemodialysis session decreased total polyphenol concentration by 16% and phenolic acids from 30% (caffeic) to 58% (vanillic and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) and these compounds appeared in the dialysate. The percentage decrease (\u0394%) of creatinine concentration correlated with the \u0394% of total polyphenols and five phenolic acids (3-hydroxyphenylacetic, dihydrocaffeic, hippuric, homovanillic, and vanillic acid). Urea \u0394% and Kt/V correlated only with the \u0394% of homovanilic acid. The results demonstrate that phenols accumulate variably in hemodialyzed patients and are differently eliminated during hemodialysis. Residual renal function ensures a lower concentration of plasma phenols."

More frequent haemodialysis 5-6 days/week in randomized clinical trials has shown benefits for controlling volume overload, blood pressure and phosphorus, reducing left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and improving patient tolerance to therapy. Therapy prescriptions were guided by volume of urea cleared, time-integrated fluid loading control and increased phosphate-\u03b22 microglobulin removal, with greater treatment frequency to address clinical efficacy targets. Case studies in all three categories show that treatment with more frequent haemodialysis in low-dialysate flow systems (Qd <200 mL/min, dialysate of 25-30 L/session, 5-7 days/week for 2.5-3.0 h/session) improves control of heart failure. In pregnancy, treatment 7 days/week with 30 L and 3 h/session of dialysis enabled successful delivery of infants at 32-34 weeks, with all doing well 2-5 years after birth. Obese patients with a body mass index (BMI) >35 achieved control of volume, blood pressure and uraemic symptoms compared to their prior 3 times/week in-centre haemodialysis. Greater application of more frequent haemodialysis should be considered, particularly in high-risk populations, to improve clinical care."

    "content": "Vaccination against COVID-19 in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on replacement therapy and kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) is particularly important due to the high mortality rate. Here, we tested the local and systemic immunity to the novel Pfizer BioNTech (BNT162b2) messenger RNA (mRNA) in ESRD, KTR patients, and healthy individuals (150 subjects). The ESRD group was divided into: hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD). We investigated the local and systemic immunity based on anti-N (nucleoprotein) and anti-S (spike1/2) Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, respectively. Additionally, we performed an Interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) release test Interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) to monitor the cellular component of vaccine response. The control group had the highest level of anti-S IgG antibodies (153/2,080 binding antibody units (BAU)/ml) among all analyzed patients after the 1st and 2nd dose, respectively. The HD group (48/926 BAU/ml) had a diminished antibody level compared to PD (93/1,607 BAU/ml). Moreover, the seroconversion rate after the 1st dose was lower in HD than PD (56% vs. 86%). KTRs had extremely low seroconversion (33%). IgA-mediated immunity was the most effective in the control group, while other patients had diminished IgA production. We observed a lower percentage of vaccine responders based on the IFN-\u03b3 level in all research participants (100% vs. 85% in control, 100% vs. 80% in PD, 97% vs. 64% in HD). 63% of seropositive KTRs had a positive IGRA, while 28% of seronegative patients produced IFN-\u03b3. Collectively, PD patients had the strongest response among ESRD patients. Two doses of the Pfizer vaccine are ineffective, especially in HD and KTRs.

    "content": "Hepatitis B (HB) vaccination in hemodialysis patients is important as they are at a higher risk of contracting HB. However, hemodialysis patients have a lower HB seroconversion rate than their healthy counterparts. As better sleep has been associated with better seroconversion in healthy populations and early hemodialysis start has been linked to significant sleep-wake disturbances in hemodialysis patients, we examined if hemodialysis treatment start time is associated with HB vaccination response.Demographics, standard-of-care clinical, laboratory, and treatment parameters, dialysis shift data, HB antigen status, HB vaccination status, and HB titers were collected from hemodialysis patients in Fresenius clinics from January 2010 to December 2015. Patients in our analysis received 90% of dialysis treatments either before or after 8:30 a.m., were negative for HB antigen, and received a complete series of HB vaccination (Engerix B\u00ae or Recombivax HB\u2122). Univariate and multivariate regression models examined whether dialysis start time is a predictor of HB vaccination response.Patients were 65 years old, 57% male, and had a HD vintage of 10 months. Patients whose dialysis treatments started before 8:30 a.m. were more likely to be younger, male, and have a greater dialysis vintage. Patients receiving Engerix B\u00ae and starting dialysis before 8:30 a.m. had a significantly higher seroconversion rate compared to patients who started dialysis after 8:30 a.m. Early dialysis start was a significant predictor of seroconversion in univariate and multivariate regression including male gender, but not in multivariate regression including age, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and vintage.While better sleep following vaccination is associated with seroconversion in the general population, this is not the case in hemodialysis patients after multivariate adjustment. In the context of end-stage kidney disease, early dialysis start is not a significant predictor of HB vaccination response. The association between objectively measured postvaccination sleep duration and seroconversion rate should be investigated."

The primary aim of this guideline was to provide recommendations on screening for blood-borne viruses and multi-resistant organisms for dialysis units based on the available evidence.The Kidney Health Australia Caring for Australasians with Renal Impairment guidelines, overall approach to guideline development follows the GRADE framework. A facilitated workshop was conducted to ensure that patient and caregiver concerns were considered. The evidence from relevant medical databases on the impact of screening on detection and transmission rates, hospitalization, mortality and psychosocial care, was reviewed and critically appraised. The guideline group made recommendations from the evidence available.The main guideline recommendations are: Dialysis units adopt a comprehensive approach that encompasses standard infection control precautions. Conduct routine surveillance for key blood-borne viruses and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Conduct routine surveillance of individual levels of protection against hepatitis B for patients on haemodialysis. Use dedicated dialysis machines for HBV-infected patients. The evidence in totality was not found to support routine surveillance of vancomycin-resistant Enterococci . Enhanced surveillance in light of the local risk of transmittable infectious agents should be considered by dialysis units. Very few studies have reported on the potential adverse effects of screening and associated practices.Future research should focus on the potential benefits and adverse effects of screening and associated practices on clinical outcomes including infections prevented and health service delivery, and psychosocial domains for patients. Given the results of trials in the critical setting, the effectiveness of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus decolonization in people receiving dialysis therapy warrants further research."

There are a few studies showing hyperintensity of basal ganglia associated with manganese deposition in hemodialysis (HD) patients. The present study aimed to investigate the intensity changes as markers of manganese deposition in the basal ganglia and to demonstrate their association with blood manganese levels using ICP/MS technique in HD, peritoneal dialysis (PD), and renal transplant patients.The study included 20 HD, 20 PD, 20 renal transplant patients, and 20 healthy controls. Blood manganese levels were obtained, and cranial magnetic resonance images were evaluated for basal ganglia hyperintensity.Blood manganese levels were similar across all study groups (p\u00a0=\u00a00.308), whereas symmetric basal ganglia hyperintensity indicating manganese deposition was detected only in HD patients (p\u00a0=\u00a0<\u00a00.001). There was a significant relationship between manganese deposition and duration of dialysis (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05).Imaging findings suggesting manganese deposition in the basal ganglia being present only in HD patients suggest that manganese deposition could be caused by the hemodialysis method itself rather than uremia and renal failure. Further studies are required in this regard, as previous studies have not clearly identified the mechanisms by which hemodialysis causes these changes."

After a baseline 8 h haemodialysis session, subjects were randomized to either 2\u2009weeks of 8 h haemodialysis or 4 h haemodiafiltration with cross-over to the alternative treatment after a 2-week washout period. Subjects were additionally randomized to the Fresenius FX80 or Nipro Elisio in a parallel design. Blood and dialysate samples were collected at baseline and at the end of both study periods.Twelve patients completed the study. Mean (SD) age and body mass index were 55.1\u2009\u00b1\u200911.5\u2009years and 36.4\u2009\u00b1\u200910.8, respectively. Urea and creatinine reduction ratios were higher with extended-hours haemodialysis compared to haemodiafiltration (difference 14.0%, 95% CI\u2009=\u200910.6, 17.3; P\u2009<\u20090.001 and 9.1%, 95% CI\u2009=\u200911.0, 7.2; P\u2009<\u20090.001). Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) clearance was superior with haemodiafiltration (difference 20.1%, 95% CI\u2009=\u20098.7, 31.6; P\u2009=\u20090.001). No difference was seen in reduction ratios for phosphate, retinol binding protein, alpha-1-microglobulin, beta-2-microglobulin and fetuin with both modalities. Compared to Nipro Elisio, Fresenius FX80 dialyser achieved higher beta-2-microglobulin clearance (Period 1: difference 7.8%, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.3, 14.4; P\u2009=\u20090.02, Period 2:7.5%, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.0, 14.1; P\u2009=\u20090.02).Small solute clearance was superior with extended-hours haemodialysis while haemodiafiltration enhanced FGF23 clearance. Beta-2-microglobulin clearance was improved with Fresenius FX80 dialyser, but this difference is unlikely to be clinically significant."

    "content": "End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are at a substantially higher risk for developing cognitive impairment compared with the healthy population. Dialysis is an essential way to maintain the life of ESRD patients. Based on previous research, there isn't an uncontested result whether cognition was improved or worsened during dialysis.To explore the impact of dialysis treatment on cognitive performance, we recruited healthy controls (HCs), predialysis ESRD patients (predialysis group), and maintenance hemodialysis ESRD patients (HD group). All ESRD patients performed six blood biochemistry tests (hemoglobin, urea, cystatin C, Na+, K+, and parathyroid hormone). Neuropsychological tests were used to measure cognitive function. By using diffusion tensor imaging and graph-theory approaches, the topological organization of the whole-brain structural network was investigated. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were performed to investigate blood biochemistry predictors of the neuropsychological tests and the results of graph analyses in the HD group and predialysis group.Neuropsychological analysis showed the HD group exhibited better cognitive function than the predialysis group, but both were worse than HCs. Whole-brain graph analyses revealed that increased global efficiency and normalized shortest path length remained in the predialysis group and HD group than the HCs. Besides, a lower normalized clustering coefficient was found in the predialysis group relative to the HCs and HD group. For the GLM analysis, only the Cystatin C level was significantly associated with the average fiber length of rich club connections in the predialysis group.Our study revealed that dialysis had a limited effect on cognitive improvement."

    "content": "The GEHIS (German Epidemiological Hemodialysis Itch Study) is a representative cohort study started in 2013 with 860 haemodialysis (HD) patients in 25 German dialysis units. Chronic itch (CI) has been reported to be a poor prognostic marker for patients on HD; however, this has not been investigated in a representative patient cohort. In 2017, all HD patients were contacted again to investigate mortality in those with and without CI and to identify its determinants. Patients' characteristics, study instruments and CI were assessed, as in 2013. The response rate was 84.2% (n\u2009=\u2009724). One-year mortality was 15.3%. Mortality was significantly higher in those with secondary scratch lesions compared with those with non-affected skin. This was also true after controlling for age and sex in a multivariate model. This study demonstrates a high mortality in HD patients; however, mortality depends on itch intensity, not on the occurrence of CI itself."

    "content": "Dialysis is associated with frequent hospitalisations. Studies comparing hospitalisations between peritoneal dialysis (PD) and haemodialysis (HD) report conflicting results and mostly analyse data of patients that remain on their initial dialysis modality. This cohort study compares hospitalisations between PD and HD patients taking into account transitions between modalities.The Dutch nOcturnal and hoME dialysis Study To Improve Clinical Outcomes collected hospitalisation data of patients who started dialysis between 2012 and 2017. Primary outcome was hospitalisation rate, analysed with a multi-state model that attributed each hospitalisation to the current dialysis modality.In total, 695 patients (252 PD, 443 HD) treated in 31 Dutch hospitals were included. The crude hospitalisation rate for PD was 2.3 (\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.0) and for HD 1.4 (\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2) hospitalisations per patient-year. The adjusted hazard ratio for hospitalisation rate was 1.1 (95%CI 1.02-1.3) for PD compared with HD. The risk for first hospitalisation was 1.3 times (95%CI 1.1-1.6) higher for PD compared with HD during the first year after dialysis initiation. The number of hospitalisations and number of hospital days per patient-year were significantly higher for PD. The most common causes of PD and HD hospitalisations were peritonitis (23%) and vascular access-related problems (33%).PD was associated with higher hospitalisation rate, higher risk for first hospitalisation and higher number of hospitalisations compared with HD. Since the PD hospitalisations were mainly caused by peritonitis, more attention to infection prevention is necessary for reducing the number of hospitalisations in the future."

This study compared the survival between incident hemodialysis (HD) and PD patients, with and without diabetes, in the era of icodextrin treatment.From the Taiwan health insurance database, 53,103 incident end-stage renal disease patients undergoing dialysis were identified from 2005 to 2010. The mortality risks among HD and PD patients with or without icodextrin treatment were compared. The follow-up period started from the date of dialysis initiation to December 31, 2011. The competing-risks regression model was used to estimate the subhazard ratio (SHR) of death with considering renal transplantation as a competing event.Compared with the corresponding HD patients, mortality risks were higher in diabetic PD patients with icodextrin treatment (Bonferroni adjusted SHR=1.16, 98.3% CI=1.04-1.30) and without the treatment (Bonferroni adjusted SHR=1.35, 98.3% CI=1.16-1.57), particularly for elderly patients. Mortality risks for patients without diabetes were not different among the three cohorts. The time-dependent competing-risks model showed that PD patients with icodextrin treatment exhibited a reduced risk of death for diabetic patients, compared with those without icodextrin treatment (adjusted SHR=0.84, 95% CI=0.72-0.97).Icodextrin could attenuate the survival disadvantage for PD relative to HD in diabetic patients, particularly for the elderly patients."

    "content": "Nutritional status and micronutrient levels of end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients may vary depending on the mode of renal replacement therapy (RRT). We aimed to compare the effects of hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis (PD) and renal transplantation (RT) on micronutrient levels and nutritional status in ESRD patients.A total of 77 ESRD patients who had not received RRT were included in this prospective longitudinal study. All ESRD patients underwent a blood serum analysis that assessed the micronutrients such as selenium, copper, zinc, chromium, retinol, thiamine and vitamin B6 as well as a nutritional status assessment. After the baseline assessments and the initiation of RRT was accomplished, all patients were followed for 6 months.The study showed significant improvements in subjective global assessment scores (percentage increases in score A were 26.6 and 36.6; p\u202f=\u202f0.039 and p\u202f=\u202f0.001; respectively), mid-arm circumference and the skin-fold thicknesses (p\u202f<\u202f0.001, p\u202f<\u202f0.001; respectively) in the RT and hemodialysis groups. The examinations at sixth month revealed a significant increase in body weight (4.8\u202fkg; p\u202f=\u202f0.002) and albumin levels (0.6\u202fg/dL; p\u202f<\u202f0.001) in only RT group. Zinc, thiamin and vitamin B6 were the most deficient micronutrients (44.1 %, 24.7 % and 35.1 %; respectively) in ESRD patients. There was a significant increase in selenium and retinol levels (p\u202f=\u202f0.020 and p\u202f<\u202f0.001; respectively) but a significant decrease in thiamin levels (p\u202f=\u202f0.041) in RT patients. A significant increase in retinol levels (p\u202f=\u202f0.028) and a significant decrease in thiamin levels (p\u202f=\u202f0.022) was observed in the hemodialysis patients. However, no significant change in micronutrient levels was observed in the PD patients.The results support the recommendation that ESRD patients should be supplemented with water-soluble vitamins, especially thiamine and vitamin B6, and trace elements, especially zinc. RT appears to be superior to other modes of RRT when examining SGA score, anthropometric measurements, albumin and micronutrient levels."

Given that renal comorbidities are common in patients admitted for CABP, understanding the pharmacokinetics of lefamulin in the face of severe renal impairment, including those requiring hemodialysis, is needed.Open-label, Phase-1 pharmacokinetic study.Research Study Center.Twenty-three matched subjects were included, seven with \"Normal\" renal function (creatinine clearance >90\u00a0ml/min), eight with \"Severe\" renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate <30\u00a0ml/min/1.73\u00a0m<sup>2</sup> ), and eight subjects requiring hemodialysis.Subjects were administered a single dose of lefamulin IV 150\u00a0mg as a 1-h infusion. Subjects in the hemodialysis group started hemodialysis within 1\u00a0h after lefamulin infusion (On dialysis), as well as, on a non-dialysis day (Off dialysis). Plasma, urine, and dialysate fluid were collected for 36\u00a0h and analyzed for lefamulin and its major metabolite, BC-8041. Lefamulin was primarily excreted non-renally across groups. Statistical analyses revealed lefamulin and BC-8041 pharmacokinetics were similar between Normal and Severe groups, except for renal clearance, which decreased in Severe subjects (mean 1.3 L/h Normal vs. 0.4 L/h Severe). Likewise, lefamulin pharmacokinetics during on and off dialysis were unchanged, with lefamulin not measurably filtered in dialysate fluid. Two, three, and three subjects reported drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) in Normal, Severe, and Hemodialysis groups, respectively. All TEAEs were mild, except one (infusion-site reaction) that was classified as moderate.No dosage adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment, and lefamulin can be administered without regard to hemodialysis timing."

    "content": "Survival of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients in Japan is high, but few reports exist on cause-specific mortality, transfer to haemodialysis (HD) or hybrid dialysis and hospitalisation risks. We aimed to identify reasons for transfer to HD, hybrid dialysis and hospitalisation in the Japan Peritoneal Dialysis and Outcomes Practice Patterns Study.This observational study included 808 adult PD patients across 31 facilities in Japan in 2014-2017. Information on all-cause and cause-specific mortality and hospitalisation and permanent transfer to HD and PD/HD hybrid therapy were prospectively collected and rates calculated.Median follow-up time was 1.66 years where 162 patients transferred to HD, 79 transferred to hybrid dialysis and 74 patients died. All-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related mortality rates were 5.1 and 1.7 deaths/100 patient-years, respectively. Rates of transfer to HD and hybrid therapy were 11.2 and 5.5 transfers/100 patient-years, respectively. Among HD transfers, 40% were due to infection (including peritonitis), while 20% were due to inadequate solute/water clearance. Eighty-one percent of hybrid dialysis transfers were due to inadequate solute/water clearance. All--cause, peritonitis-related and CVD-related hospitalisation rates were 120.4, 21.1 and 15.6/100 patient-years, respectively. Median hospital length of stay was 19 days.Mortality, hospitalisation and transfer to HD/hybrid dialysis rates are relatively low in Japan compared to many other countries with hybrid transfers, accounting for one-third of dialysis transfers from PD. Further study is needed to explain the high inter-facility variation in hospitalisation rates and how to further reduce hospitalisation rates for Japanese PD patients."

    "content": "Population-specific consensus documents recommend that the diagnosis of hypertension in haemodialysis patients be based on 48-h ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring. However, until now there is just one study in the USA on the prevalence of hypertension in haemodialysis patients by 44-h recordings. Since there is a knowledge gap on the problem in European countries, we reassessed the problem in the European Cardiovascular and Renal Medicine working group Registry of the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association.A total of 396 haemodialysis patients underwent 48-h ABP monitoring during a regular haemodialysis session and the subsequent interdialytic interval. Hypertension was defined as (i) pre-haemodialysis blood pressure (BP)\u2009\u2265140/90\u2009mmHg or use of antihypertensive agents and (ii) ABP\u2009\u2265130/80\u2009mmHg or use of antihypertensive agents.The prevalence of hypertension by 48-h ABP monitoring was very high (84.3%) and close to that by pre-haemodialysis BP (89.4%) but the agreement of the two techniques was not of the same magnitude (\u03ba statistics\u2009=\u20090.648; P\u2009<0.001). In all, 290 participants were receiving antihypertensive treatment. In all, 9.1% of haemodialysis patients were categorized as normotensives, 12.6% had controlled hypertension confirmed by the two BP techniques, while 46.0% had uncontrolled hypertension with both techniques. The prevalence of white coat hypertension was 18.2% and that of masked hypertension 14.1%. Of note, hypertension was confined only to night-time in 22.2% of patients while just 1% of patients had only daytime hypertension. Pre-dialysis BP\u2009\u2265140/90\u2009mmHg had 76% sensitivity and 54% specificity for the diagnosis of BP\u2009\u2265130/80\u2009mmHg by 48-h ABP monitoring.The prevalence of hypertension in haemodialysis patients assessed by 48-h ABP monitoring is very high. Pre-haemodialysis BP poorly reflects the 48\u2009h-ABP burden. About a third of the haemodialysis population has white coat or masked hypertension. These findings add weight to consensus documents supporting the use of ABP monitoring for proper hypertension diagnosis and treatment in this population."

The treatment available includes haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and kidney transplantation. All treatment options have their pros and cons, needs and preferences, though haemodialysis is one of the most available entity in Pakistan. There are a few intrinsic problems associated with haemodialysis which has significant environmental as well as economic impact. One of the most important is the need of huge quantity of water to carry out the haemodialysis procedure along with production of solid waste in the form of disposables and electricity consumption. Peritoneal dialysis on the other hand is more environment-friendly and cost-effective and it should be one of the preferred options for our CKD patients."

We also determined whether differences in Medicare expenditures across dialysis modalities persisted as more patients were placed on PD. We used propensity scores to match 8305 patients initiating PD with 8305 similar patients initiating hemodialysis.Overall average expenditures were US$108,656 (2017) for hemodialysis and US$91,716 for PD (proportionate difference, 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09 to 1.13). This difference did not change over time (<i>P</i> for time interaction term=0.14). Hemodialysis had higher estimated intravenous (iv) dialysis drug costs (1.69; 95% CI, 1.64 to 1.73), rehabilitation expenditures (1.35; 95% CI, 1.26 to 1.45), and other nondialysis expenditures (1.34; 95% CI, 1.30 to 1.37). Over time, initial differences in total dialysis expenditures disappeared and differences in iv dialysis drug utilization narrowed as nondialysis expenditures diverged. Estimated iv drug costs declined by US$2900 per patient-year in hemodialysis between 2008 and 2014 versus US$900 per patient-year in PD.From the perspective of the Medicare program, savings associated with PD in patients \u226567 years have remained unchanged, despite rapid growth in the use of this dialysis modality. Total dialysis expenditures for the two modalities converged over time, whereas nondialysis expenditures diverged."

A Spearman correlation coefficient analysis revealed that shortened RBC age positively correlated with transferrin saturation (r\u2009=\u20090.54), ferritin level (r\u2009=\u20090.47), and haptoglobin level (r\u2009=\u20090.39) but inversely related with reticulocyte (r\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.36), weekly doses of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs; r\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.62), erythropoietin resistance index (r\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.64), and intradialytic ultrafiltration rate (r\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.32).Shortened RBC age was observed in patients who were receiving maintenance haemodialysis and was associated with iron deficiency, greater haptoglobin consumption, higher ESA requirements, and poor erythropoietin responsiveness, as well as with greater intradialytic fluid extraction."

    "title": "Peritoneal dialysis has optimal intradialytic hemodynamics and preserves residual renal function: Why isn't it better than hemodialysis?",
    "content": "Rates of cardiovascular mortality are disproportionately high in patients with end stage kidney disease receiving dialysis. However, it is now generally accepted that patient survival is broadly equivalent between the two most frequently used forms of dialysis, in-center hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD). This equivalent patient survival is notable when considering how specific aspects of HD have been shown to contribute to morbidity and mortality. These include more rapid loss of residual renal function (RRF), HD-induced myocardial and cerebral ischemia, and risk factors associated with the intermittent delivery of HD. Potential mechanisms specific to PD that may drive cardiovascular disease include the metabolic consequences of excessive absorption of glucose and glucose degradation products (GDPs), inadequate volume control, and high rates of hypokalemia. The aim of this review is to compare and contrast the different drivers of adverse outcomes between the dialysis modalities, as greater understanding of this may help in patient-centered decision-making when considering options for renal replacement therapy."

The subjects were divided into two groups according to their pre-dialysis blood pressure: a standard target group (pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure of 110-140\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg) and a relaxed target group (pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure of 155-165\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg). The Quality Metrics SF-36 survey instrument was used to assess health-related quality of life in the study participants. In addition, general clinical data and biochemical indicators including heart rate, respiration rate, blood pressure and ultrafiltration volume and rate during dialysis were observed and recorded. Patients were followed-up for 12\u00a0months, and prognostic data were recorded. Death was regarded as the endpoint.Scores on the SF-36 in the standard target group were significantly higher than those in the relaxed target group, with the exception of the role-emotional (RE) and mental health (MH) dimensions. At the end of the study, the number of mortality events in the relaxed target group was higher than in the standard target group. There were no other significant differences between the two groups.The scores from the health-related quality of life survey were higher in standard target group, but no differences in mortality risk between the two groups were observed."

This study explored patient- and centre-level characteristics associated with weekly haemodialysis hours.Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant (ANZDATA) Registry data were analysed. Characteristics associated with weekly duration were evaluated using mixed-effects linear regression models with patient- and centre-level covariates as fixed effects, and dialysis centre and state as random effects using the 2017 prevalent in-centre haemodialysis (ICHD) and home haemodialysis (HHD) cohorts. Evaluation of patterns of weekly duration over time analysed the 2000 to 2017 incident ICHD and HHD cohorts.Overall, 12\u2009494 ICHD and 1493 HHD prevalent patients in 2017 were included. Median weekly treatment duration was 13.5 (interquartile range [IQR] 12-15) hours for ICHD and 16 (IQR 15-20) hours for HHD. Male sex, younger age, higher body mass index, arteriovenous fistula/graft use, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ethnicity and longer dialysis vintage were associated with longer weekly duration for both ICHD and HHD. No centre characteristics were associated with duration. Variability in duration across centres was very limited in ICHD compared with HHD, with variation in HHD being associated with state. Duration did not vary significantly over time for ICHD, whereas longer weekly HHD treatments were reported between 2006 and 2012 compared with before and after this period.This study in the Australian and New Zealand haemodialysis population showed that weekly duration was primarily associated with patient characteristics. No centre effect was demonstrated. Practice patterns seemed to differ across states/countries, with more variability in HHD than ICHD."

    "content": "The pharmacokinetics of oxycodone in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring haemodialysis are largely unknown. Therefore, we investigated the pharmacokinetics of oxycodone/naloxone prolonged release and their metabolites in patients with ESRD during and between haemodialysis sessions.Single doses of oxycodone/naloxone (5/2.5 or 10/5\u2009mg) were administered in nine patients with ESRD using a cross-over design on the day of dialysis and on a day between dialysis sessions. Plasma, dialysate and urine concentrations of oxycodone, naloxone and their metabolites were determined up to 48\u2009h post-dosing using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry system.Haemodialysis performed 6-10\u2009h after dosing removed \u223c10% of the administered dose of oxycodone predominantly as unconjugated oxycodone and noroxycodone or conjugated oxymorphone and noroxymorphone. The haemodialysis clearance of oxycodone based on its recovery in dialysate was (mean \u00b1 SD) 8.4\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1\u2009L/h. The geometric mean (coefficient of variation) plasma elimination half-life of oxycodone during the 4-h haemodialysis period was 3.9\u2009h (39%) which was significantly shorter than the 5.7\u2009h (22%) without haemodialysis. Plasma levels of the active metabolite oxymorphone in its unconjugated form were very low.Oxycodone is removed during haemodialysis. The pharmacokinetics including the relatively short half-life of oxycodone in patients with ESRD with or without haemodialysis and the absence of unconjugated active metabolites indicate that oxycodone can be used at usual doses in patients requiring dialysis."

    "content": "The main objective of the study was to analyse the progression of residual renal function according to the dialysis technique (peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis) and the frequency of treatment (two or three sessions of haemodialysis per week). As secondary objectives, we studied the progression of the serum concentration levels of \u03b22 microglobulin and the response of anaemia to erythropoietic agents.193 non-anuric patients were included and began renal replacement therapy with dialysis in our hospital between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2011, with a follow-up period of over three months. 61 patients (32%) began treatment with two haemodialysis sessions per week, 49 patients (25%) with three haemodialysis sessions per week and 83 patients (43%) with peritoneal dialysis. The glomerular filtration rate was measured as the mean of the renal clearances of urea and creatinine.The rate of decrease in glomerular filtration was the same in patients who began treatment with two haemodialysis sessions per week and with peritoneal dialysis (median 0.18 ml/min/month) and it was higher in patients who began treatment with three sessions of haemodialysis per week (median 0.33 ml/min/month, P<.05). Throughout progression, the glomerular filtration rate did not display differences between the group that began with two weekly sessions of haemodialysis and the group on peritoneal dialysis, and it was lower in the group that began treatment with three sessions of haemodialysis per week with statistical significance during the first 24 months of follow up. In the three patient groups, \u03b22-microglobulin concentration increased as the glomerular filtration rate decreased and it was higher in the group on three weekly haemodialysis sessions for the first 12 months of follow up. In all the controls carried out, there was a negative correlation between the beta-2 microglobulin concentration and the glomerular filtration rate (P<.001). The erythropoietin dose was negatively related to glomerular filtration. Patients who began with two sessions of haemodialysis per week required a lower dose of erythropoietin than patients that began renal replacement therapy with three weekly sessions. The erythropoietin dose in the peritoneal dialysis group was below that of the group of two weekly haemodialysis sessions despite maintaining a similar glomerular filtration rate.Patients who begin treatment with two sessions of haemodialysis per week experience the same rate of decrease in residual renal function as patients treated with peritoneal dialysis. The progression of the concentration of \u03b22-microglobulin is parallel to that of the glomerular filtration rate. Patients treated with two haemodialysis sessions require a lower dose of erythropoietin than those who receive three sessions per week, but a significantly higher dose than those treated with peritoneal dialysis, which suggests that the response of anaemia to erythropoietic agents is not only related to residual renal function, but also to other factors that are inherent to the dialysis technique."

Comparisons were made using Chi-square and corresponding P values were reported accordingly. P < 0.05 was considered significant.A total of 1167 patients' data were studied. Of these, 252 (21.6%) patients with end-stage renal disease were dialyzed at SHS. The SHS dialysis center experienced 5 months of interruption in dialysis service. Only 38 (15.1%) patients sustained dialysis beyond 90 days and 105 (41.7%) patients had more than three sessions of hemodialysis. Only one patient was referred for kidney transplant from the dialysis center during the review period. SHS performed better than Federal Medical Center and Sir Yahaya Hospitals in terms of service availability, duration on hemodialysis, and greater number of hemodialysis sessions (\u03c7<sup>2</sup> = 29.06, df = 3, P < 0.001).PPP has improved the availability of dialysis service, mean duration on dialysis, and mean number of dialysis sessions but did not improve the kidney transplant referral rate at SHS. There is a need to encourage the current arrangement in the Hospital as well as other centers offering similar partnerships."

All studies reported a marked improvement in hip function following THA. There were 27 failures (15.7% revision rate) in the haemodialysis group and 101 failures (16.0% revision rate) in the transplant group. The revision rate for cemented implants was higher in haemodialysis versus transplant patients (23% vs. 15%), with the converse being true for uncemented implants (3.8% vs. 6.9%). The deep infection rate was higher in the haemodialysis group (10.8% vs. 2.1%).Patients receiving haemodialysis or with a history of renal transplantation can expect good functional outcome following THA. However, the revision rate and deep infection rate are higher than would be expected in patients receiving THA for primary OA. Aseptic loosening is the most common reason for revision. Uncemented implants appear to be associated with lower failure rates both in haemodialysis patients and those who have had a transplant."

    "content": "Free-living amoeba (FLA), including Acanthamoeba, Naegleria, Balamuthia and Vermamoeba, have been isolated from water, sand, soil, dust and air. Numerous studies considered that FLA are a significant cause of neurological and ocular complications in high-risk groups, including immunocompromised individuals. The present study aimed to identify morphological and molecular characteristics of FLA isolates in dialysis fluid samples of hydraulic systems in hemodialysis units in Iran.A total of 328 dialysis fluid samples were collected from 16 dialysis machines, including 164 samples before hemodialysis sessions (after cleaning) and 164 samples after hemodialysis sessions (before cleaning). Filtration and cultivation were performed on non-nutrient agar medium. Also, PCR and sequencing were applied by using the genus-specific primers along with a common primer set on positive samples.Both morphology and molecular investigations showed that 22.5% (74/328) of dialysis fluid samples were positive for FLA. There was a positive relationship between the high frequency of FLA after hemodialysis sessions (before cleaning) compared with before hemodialysis sessions (after cleaning) (OR=2.86; 95% CI 1.5 to 5.45). Considering the PCR assay, 16.46% (54/328) samples were identified as Acanthamoeba spp. (belonging to T3 and T4 genotypes), 5.18% (17/328) as Vermamoeba vermiformis and 0.91% (3/328) as Vahlkampfiidae family (Naegleria australiensis, Naegleria pagei and Allovahlkampfia).The present results support a need to improve filtration and purification methods for dialysis fluid of hydraulic systems in hemodialysis units. They also highlight the relevance of periodic screenings for FLA-related diseases in hemodialysis patients."

Evidence on the possible echocardiographic differences between hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis (PD) is scarce. This study aimed to evaluate differences in left (LA) and right atrial (RA), left (LV) and right ventricular (RV) geometry, systolic and diastolic function in hemodialysis, and PD patients. Thirty-eight hemodialysis and 38 PD patients were matched for age, sex, and dialysis vintage. Two-dimensional and tissue-Doppler echocardiography, and lung ultrasound were performed during an interdialytic day in hemodialysis and before a programmed follow-up visit in PD patients. Vena cava diameter (11.09\u2009\u00b1\u20094.53 vs. 14.91\u2009\u00b1\u20094.30\u2009mm; p\u2009<\u20090.001) was significantly lower in hemodialysis patients. Indices of LA, RA, LV, and RV dimensions were similar between the two groups. LVMi (116.91 [38.56] vs. 122.83 [52.33]\u00a0g/m<sup>2</sup> ; p\u00a0=\u00a00.767) was similar, but relative wall thickness was marginally (0.40 [0.14] vs. 0.45 [0.15]\u00a0cm; p\u00a0=\u00a00.055) lower in hemodialysis patients. LV hypertrophy prevalence was similar between groups (73.7% vs. 71.1%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.798), but hemodialysis patients presented eccentric and PD patients concentric LVH. Regarding ventricular systolic function, stroke volume (p\u00a0=\u00a00.030) and cardiac output (p\u00a0=\u00a00.036) were higher in hemodialysis, while RV systolic pressure (RVSP) (20.37 [22.54] vs. 27.68 [14.32]\u00a0mm Hg; p\u00a0=\u00a00.009) was higher in PD. No significant differences were evidenced in diastolic function indices and lung water excess between the two groups. A moderate association was noted between ultrasound B-lines score and LA volume index (r\u00a0=\u00a00.465, p\u2009<\u20090.001), RVSP (r\u00a0=\u00a00.431, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and E/e' ratio (r\u00a0=\u00a00.304, p\u00a0=\u00a00.009).

    "content": "Residual renal function (RRF) confers survival in patients with ESRD but declines after initiating hemodialysis. Previous research shows that dialysate cooling reduces hemodialysis-induced circulatory stress and protects the brain and heart from ischemic injury. Whether hemodialysis-induced circulatory stress affects renal perfusion, and if it can be ameliorated with dialysate cooling to potentially reduce RRF loss, is unknown.We used renal computed tomography perfusion imaging to scan 29 patients undergoing continuous dialysis under standard (36.5\u00b0C dialysate temperature) conditions; we also scanned another 15 patients under both standard and cooled (35.0\u00b0C) conditions. Imaging was performed immediately before, 3 hours into, and 15 minutes after hemodialysis sessions. We used perfusion maps to quantify renal perfusion. To provide a reference to another organ vulnerable to hemodialysis-induced ischemic injury, we also used echocardiography to assess intradialytic myocardial stunning.During standard hemodialysis, renal perfusion decreased 18.4% (<i>P</i><0.005) and correlated with myocardial injury (<i>r</i>=-0.33; <i>P</i><0.05). During sessions with dialysis cooling, patients experienced a 10.6% decrease in perfusion (not significantly different from the decline with standard hemodialysis), and ten of the 15 patients showed improved or no effect on myocardial stunning.This study shows an acute decrease in renal perfusion during hemodialysis, a first step toward pathophysiologic characterization of hemodialysis-mediated RRF decline. Dialysate cooling ameliorated this decline but this effect did not reach statistical significance. Further study is needed to explore the potential of dialysate cooling as a therapeutic approach to slow RRF decline."

    "content": "Fatigue is prevalent in hemodialysis patients who for survival follow a strict dialysis treatment regimen - dialysis and non-dialysis days. As a result, the daily activities, symptom burden, and clinical outcomes of hemodialysis patients vary significantly between dialysis and non-dialysis days. Fatigue is one of the most reported debilitating symptoms by hemodialysis patients with profound negative impact on their quality of life. Prior studies assessed fatigue during the preceding 7 or 30\u2009days and did not discriminate fatigue characteristics between dialysis and non-dialysis days. We aimed to characterize and compare fatigue severity and fatigue interference with daily activities between dialysis and non-dialysis days.Hemodialysis patients self-reported fatigue on consecutive dialysis and non-dialysis days using the 9-item Brief Fatigue Inventory. The differences in fatigue characteristics between dialysis and non-dialysis days were analyzed using one-way\u00a0ANCOVA.Global fatigue burden was worse on a dialysis day compared to a non-dialysis day (P for all <\u20090.001). Age and education were associated with fatigue, but hemodialysis-related variables were not. A significant inverse association of physical activity with fatigue severity observed on non-dialysis day; there was also a negative association between the normalized protein catabolic rate and fatigue severity on both dialysis and non-dialysis days. The positive association of depression with fatigue severity and fatigue interference were consistent on both dialysis and non-dialysis days. None of these factors, however, explained differences in fatigue characteristics between dialysis and non-dialysis days.Fatigue, measured in severity and interference, was more pronounced on a dialysis day relative to a non-dialysis day. These differences were not explained by age, sex, education, hemodialysis-related variables, habitual exercise, nutritional status, and or depression. The quantitative measures of fatigue characteristics may facilitate future interventional trials design and better fatigue management for hemodialysis patients."

    "content": "Post-dialysis recovery time (DRT) has an important relationship to quality of life and survival, as identified in studies of ESRD patients on conventional dialysis. ESRD patients are often discharged from hospitals to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) where on-site treatment using home hemodialysis technology is increasingly offered, but nothing is known about DRT in this patient population.From November 4, 2019 to June 11, 2021, within a dialysis organization providing service across 12 states and 154 SNFs, patients receiving in-SNF, more frequent dialysis (MFD) (modeled to deliver 14 treatment hours minimum per week and stdKt/V \u22652.0) were asked to describe their post-dialysis recovery time following their previous treatment, within predefined categoric choices: 0-\u00bd, \u00bd-1, 1-2, 2-4, 4-8, 8-12\u2009h, by next morning, or not even by next morning. Patients reporting DRT following at least one full-week treatment opportunity were included in a mixed model logistic regression of rapid recovery (DRT \u22642\u00a0h).Two thousand three hundred and nine patients met the statistical modeling inclusion criteria, providing DRT on 108,876 dialysis sessions, while receiving mean (SD) 4.3 (0.96) weekly dialysis treatments. 2118 (92%) reported DRT \u22642\u00a0h. Results appeared biologically plausible, as lower odds of rapid DRT were observed for patients who were older, missed their previous treatment, or experienced intradialytic hypotension. Greater odds of rapid DRT were observed in patients receiving five dialyses in the previous week or having 160-179\u00a0mmHg pre-hemodialysis systolic blood pressure. Rapid recovery was associated with reduced mortality or hospitalization.SNF dialysis patients receiving 5x per week MFD report rapid recovery time \u22642\u2009h in 92% of dialyses despite advanced age, frailty, and comorbidities. Future studies will assess the practical ramifications of rapid DRT perception/experience on nursing home rehabilitation programs, which could impact patient health beyond the nursing home stay."

    "title": "Renal Association Clinical Practice Guideline on Haemodialysis.",
    "content": "This guideline is written primarily for doctors and nurses working in dialysis units and related areas of medicine in the UK, and is an update of a previous version written in 2009. It aims to provide guidance on how to look after patients and how to run dialysis units, and provides standards which units should in general aim to achieve. We would not advise patients to interpret the guideline as a rulebook, but perhaps to answer the question: \"what does good quality haemodialysis look like?\"The guideline is split into sections: each begins with a few statements which are graded by strength (1 is a firm recommendation, 2 is more like a sensible suggestion), and the type of research available to back up the statement, ranging from A (good quality trials so we are pretty sure this is right) to D (more like the opinion of experts than known for sure). After the statements there is a short summary explaining why we think this, often including a discussion of some of the most helpful research. There is then a list of the most important medical articles so that you can read further if you want to - most of this is freely available online, at least in summary form.A few notes on the individual sections: 1. This section is about how much dialysis a patient should have. The effectiveness of dialysis varies between patients because of differences in body size and age etc., so different people need different amounts, and this section gives guidance on what defines \"enough\" dialysis and how to make sure each person is getting that. Quite a bit of this section is very technical, for example, the term \"eKt/V\" is often used: this is a calculation based on blood tests before and after dialysis, which measures the effectiveness of a single dialysis session in a particular patient. 2. This section deals with \"non-standard\" dialysis, which basically means anything other than 3 times per week. For example, a few people need 4 or more sessions per week to keep healthy, and some people are fine with only 2 sessions per week - this is usually people who are older, or those who have only just started dialysis. Special considerations for children and pregnant patients are also covered here. 3. This section deals with membranes (the type of \"filter\" used in the dialysis machine) and \"HDF\" (haemodiafiltration) which is a more complex kind of dialysis which some doctors think is better. Studies are still being done, but at the moment we think it's as good as but not better than regular dialysis. 4. This section deals with fluid removal during dialysis sessions: how to remove enough fluid without causing cramps and low blood pressure. Amongst other recommendations we advise close collaboration with patients over this. 5. This section deals with dialysate, which is the fluid used to \"pull\" toxins out of the blood (it is sometimes called the \"bath\"). The level of things like potassium in the dialysate is important, otherwise too much or too little may be removed. There is a section on dialysate buffer (bicarbonate) and also a section on phosphate, which occasionally needs to be added into the dialysate. 6. This section is about anticoagulation (blood thinning) which is needed to stop the circuit from clotting, but sometimes causes side effects. 7. This section is about certain safety aspects of dialysis, not seeking to replace well-established local protocols, but focussing on just a few where we thought some national-level guidance would be useful. 8. This section draws together a few aspects of dialysis which don't easily fit elsewhere, and which impact on how dialysis feels to patients, rather than the medical outcome, though of course these are linked. This is where home haemodialysis and exercise are covered. There is an appendix at the end which covers a few aspects in more detail, especially the mathematical ideas. Several aspects of dialysis are not included in this guideline since they are covered elsewhere, often because they are aspects which affect non-dialysis patients too. This includes: anaemia, calcium and bone health, high blood pressure, nutrition, infection control, vascular access, transplant planning, and when dialysis should be started."

For those with valid Fitbit data (defined as \u226510\u2009hours of wear per day) for 28\u2009days (n = 45), participants walked an average of 3688 steps per day, and 73% of participants were sedentary (<5000\u2009steps/day). Participants aged >80\u2009years were less active than younger (age\u2009<\u200965\u2009years) participants (1232 vs. 4529 steps, P = 0.01). There were no statistical differences between the groups when stratified by gender (women vs. men [2817 vs. 4324 steps, respectively]), urbanicity (rural vs. urban dialysis unit [3141 vs. 4123 steps, respectively]), and dialysis/nondialysis day (3177 vs. 4133 steps, respectively). Due to the small sample size, we also calculated effect sizes. The effect size was medium for the gender differences (cohen's d = 0.57) and small to medium for urbanicity and dialysis/nondialysis day (d = 0.37 and d = 0.33, respectively). We found no association between physical activity and self-reported depression and fatigue scale. The majority of participants (62%, 28/45) found the Fitbit tracker easy to wear and comfortable.ESKD participants receiving hemodialysis are frequently sedentary, and differences appear more pronounced in older patients. These findings may assist in designing patient-centered interventions to increase physical activity among hemodialysis patients."

    "content": "Background Benefits of patients with end-stage renal disease and atrial fibrillation undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) or hemodialysis are unknown. Methods and Results Patients undergoing dialysis were retrieved from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database during 2001 to 2013 and separated into PD or hemodialysis. Primary outcomes were ischemic stroke/systemic embolism, major bleeding, and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). An inverse probability of treatment weighting based on propensity score was used to reduce the confounding. The risk of outcomes between PD and hemodialysis was compared using Cox proportional hazard model for fatal outcomes or Fine and Gray subdistribution hazard model which considered death a competing risk, respectively. A total of 7916 patients with end-stage renal disease with atrial fibrillation undergoing PD or hemodialysis during 2001 to 2013 were identified. After exclusion criteria, 363 patients receiving PD and 5302 patients receiving hemodialysis were analyzed. At 1-year follow-up, the risk of ICH was significantly lower in the PD group compared with the hemodialysis group (0.2% versus 0.9%; subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR], 0.31; 95% CI, 0.17-0.57). At 3-year follow-up, the risks of major bleeding and ICH were significantly lower in the PD group compared with the hemodialysis group (major bleeding: 1.8% versus 3.2%; SHR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.53-0.87; ICH: 0.5% versus 2%; SHR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.21-0.48). At 5-year follow-up, ischemic stroke/systemic embolism, major bleeding, and ICH were significantly lower in the PD group compared with the hemodialysis group (ischemic stroke/systemic embolism: 12.4% versus 17.7%, SHR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.79-0.96; major bleeding: 2.6% versus 4.1%; SHR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64-0.97; ICH: 0.5% versus 2.6%; SHR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.17-0.37). Conclusions In patients with end-stage renal disease and atrial fibrillation, dialytic modalities by PD or hemodialysis impacted these patients differently. There were overall reduced ischemic stroke/systemic embolism, major bleeding, and ICH at 5-year follow-up in patients undergoing PD compared with hemodialysis."

    "content": "Technique failure, defined as death or transfer to haemodialysis (HD), is a major concern in peritoneal dialysis (PD). Nurse-assisted PD is globally associated with a lower risk of transfer to HD. We aimed to evaluate the association between assisted PD and the risk of the different causes of transfer to HD.This was a retrospective study using data from the French Language PD Registry of patients on incident PD from 2006 to 2015. The association between the use of assisted PD and the causes of transfer to HD was evaluated using survival analysis with competing events in unmatched and propensity score-matched cohorts.The study included 11\u2009093 incident PD patients treated in 123 French PD units. There were 4273 deaths, 3330 transfers to HD and 2210 renal transplantations. The causes of transfer to HD were inadequate dialysis (1283), infection (524), catheter-related problems (334), social issues (250), other causes linked to PD (422), other causes not linked to PD (481) and encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (6). Nurse-assisted PD patients were older and more comorbid. Assistance by nurse was associated with a higher risk of death [cause-specific hazard ratio (cs-HR) 2.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.26-2.74], but with a lower risk of transfer to HD [subdistributionHR (sd-HR) 0.68, 95% CI 0.62-0.76], especially due to inadequate dialysis (cs-HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75-0).The lower risk of transfer to HD associated with nurse assistance should encourage decision makers to launch reimbursement programmes in countries where it is not available."

Direct meta-analyses were conducted first. Aerobic capacity improved significantly more with aerobic training (3.35 ml/kg/min, 95% CI 1.79 to 4.91) and combined training (5.00 ml/kg/min, 95% CI 3.50 to 6.50) than with control. Only combined training significantly reduced systolic (-9 mmHg, 95% CI\u00a0-13 to\u00a0-4) and diastolic (-5 mmHg, 95% CI\u00a0-6 to\u00a0-3) blood pressure compared to control. Only aerobic training was superior to control for haemodialysis efficiency (Kt/V 0.11, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.20). However, when network meta-analysis was conducted, there were some important different findings. Both aerobic training and combined training again elicited greater improvements in aerobic capacity than control. For systolic blood pressure, combined training was superior to control. For diastolic blood pressure, combined training was superior to aerobic training and control. No modality was superior to control for haemodialysis efficiency. Combined training was ranked as the most effective treatment for aerobic capacity and arterial blood pressure.Combined training was the most effective modality to increase aerobic capacity and blood pressure control in people who require haemodialysis. This finding helps to fill the gap created by the lack of head-to-head comparisons of different modalities of exercise in people with end-stage renal disease.PROSPERO CRD42015020531."

    "content": "Recent studies have revealed unique biological characteristics of molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) as an anti-inflammatory agent. We developed a novel haemodialysis (E-HD) system delivering an H<sub>2</sub> (30-80 ppb)-enriched dialysis solution by water electrolysis, and conducted a non-randomized, non-blinded, prospective observational study exploring its clinical impact. Prevalent chronic HD patients were allocated to either the E-HD (n\u2009=\u2009161) group or the conventional HD (C-HD: n\u2009=\u2009148) group, and received the respective HD treatments during the study. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality and development of non-lethal cardio-cerebrovascular events (cardiac disease, apoplexy, and leg amputation due to peripheral artery disease). During the 3.28-year mean observation period, there were no differences in dialysis parameters between the two groups; however, post-dialysis hypertension was ameliorated with significant reductions in antihypertensive agents in the E-HD patients. There were 91 events (50 in the C-HD group and 41 in the E-HD group). Multivariate analysis of the Cox proportional hazards model revealed E-HD as an independent significant factor for the primary endpoint (hazard ratio 0.59; [95% confidence interval: 0.38-0.92]) after adjusting for confounding factors (age, cardiovascular disease history, serum albumin, and C-reactive protein). HD applying an H<sub>2</sub>-dissolved HD solution could improve the prognosis of chronic HD patients."

    "content": "Compared to traditional in-center hemodialysis (HD), in-center nocturnal dialysis (INHD) is characterized by longer sessions and nighttime administration, which may lead to better outcomes for some patients. Given the importance of patient choice in the decision to initiate INHD, we explored associations between patients' psychosocial characteristics and their receipt of INHD.Among hemodialysis patients at a medium-sized dialysis organization, we identified INHD patients as those for whom \u226580% of dialysis sessions were INHD sessions-starting at 6:30\u2009pm or later and lasting \u22655\u2009hours-over the 3\u2009months (\u226520 sessions total) after their first INHD session. We extracted dialysis session data from electronic medical records and psychosocial data from social worker assessments. We tested associations of patients' psychosocial characteristics-as well as demographic and clinical characteristics-with INHD receipt among all hemodialysis patients (INHD and HD) in bivariate analyses and multivariable logistic regression models.Among 759 patients with complete data, we identified 47 (6.2%) as INHD patients. On average, these patients were more likely than HD patients to be employed (full-time 10.6% vs. 5.2%; part-time 17.0% vs. 4.2%; P\u2009<\u20090.001), and they were significantly less likely to require ambulatory assistance (14.9% vs. 39.6%, P\u2009<\u20090.001). In multivariable regressions, we found that part-time employment (versus being unemployed) was associated with a 7.1 percentage-point higher likelihood of being an INHD patient (P = 0.01), and the negative association with ambulatory assistance needs approached statistical significance (P = 0.056). No other psychosocial factors included in this main regression analysis were statistically significantly associated with INHD patient status.Researchers comparing the outcomes of patients undergoing INHD versus other treatment modalities will need to account for differences in employment status-and other factors like requiring ambulatory assistance and age which may predict the ability to work-between INHD users and comparison patients to avoid bias in estimates."

We sought to describe the epidemiologic and clinical profile of newly admitted patient in chronic haemodialysis during the COVID-19 pandemic in Cameroon and evaluate their survival between 90days of dialysis initiation.We conducted a cohort study of 6months from April to October 2020. End stage renal disease patients newly admitted in the haemodialysis facility of the General Hospital of Douala were included. Patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 were identified. Socio-demographic, clinical and biological data at dialysis initiation as well as mortality between the 90days of dialysis initiation were registered.A total of 57 incident patients were recorded from April to October 2020 with a monthly mean of 9.5 patients. The mean age was 46.95\u00b113.12years. Twenty-four COVID-19 were identified with a frequency of 49% among emergency admission.

    "content": "A doctor has a legal duty to secure the informed consent of a patient prior to performing a medical or surgical procedure. The elements of the legal doctrine of informed consent include capacity, voluntariness and the provision and understanding of relevant information. This article examines the doctrine in the context of renal dialysis. Dialysis is a complex therapy that impacts upon quality of life and has limited survival advantage in some patients. It is likely that informed consent is often not fully integrated into the care of patients commencing dialysis. The article analyses the common law doctrine of informed consent as it relates to dialysis and presents the findings of a retrospective study of the adequacy of the consent process based on interviews with dialysis patients who commenced dialysis in the previous 12 months. It concludes with recommendations for improvement in practice."

    "content": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) treated by hemodialysis (HD) is a worldwide major public health problem. Its incidence is getting higher and higher, leading to an alarming social and economic impact. The survival of these patients is significantly low, especially during the first year of treatment. The purpose of our study was to identify the epidemiological and clinico-biological characteristics of patients at the HD initiation and to reveal the predictive factors of mortality at three months and one year of HD. This is a prospective, analytical, and descriptive study dealing with 229 patients with an end-stage renal disease (ESRD), followed up in the Nephrology Department of Charles Nicolle Hospital and La Rabta Hospital in Tunisia, that was started HD between January and June 2017. A multivariate logistic regression analysis allowed us to identify the independent predictors of mortality at three months and one year. The average age was 60.2 \u00b1 15.3 years, with a gender ratio of 1.41. Seventy-eight percent of patients had more than two comorbidities, 59% had diabetes, and 88% had hypertension. Diabetic nephropathy was the leading etiology of kidney disease (48.9%), while 11% of nephropathies were of unknown etiology. Only 58% were early referred to a nephrologist. The average glomerular filtration rate at HD initiation was 6.06 \u00b1 2.33 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia were noted, respectively, in 60.8% and 84.9% of cases. Anemia was objectified in 98.6% of cases. HD was started in an emergency in 56.8% of cases. One of the most urgent indications was acute pulmonary edema (APE) for 43.8% of patients. Only 10.5% of patients had functional arteriovenous fistula at the dialysis initiation. Patients were hemodialyzed one, two, or three sessions per week, respectively, in 23.2%, 26.6%, and 50.2% of cases. The crude mortality rate was 25% and 13% in, respectively, one year and three months of HD. On multivariate analysis, we identified heart failure and insufficient dialysis dose per week as predictive factors of mortality at the 1<sup>st</sup> year of HD. C-reactive protein more than 21 mg/L, insufficient dialysis per week, modified Charlson Comorbidity Index less than 6, and APE at the dialysis initiation were identified as predictive factors of three-month mortality. Despite the short period of study, this work revealed the alarming conditions of patients at HD initiation. This critical situation is due to the delay in CKD diagnosis, the late nephrologist referral, and the lack of preparation before HD initiation."

    "title": "Comparison Between Hemodialysis and Peritoneal Dialysis in the Risks for Disease Activity in LN-ESRD Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.",
    "content": "End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is the advanced stage of a progressive loss of kidney function. About 10% of all patients with lupus nephritis (LN) eventually progress to ESRD, which may necessitate renal replacement therapy (RRT), such as hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD), and/or kidney transplant. Research hasn't confirmed which dialysis options, prior to kidney transplantation, are beneficial to patients' prognoses.The study intended to compare the risks-related to disease activity, exercise, all-cause infection, all-cause cardiovascular events, and mortality-of the use of HD and PD for LN-ESRD adults, as the initial alternative treatment before renal transplantation.The research team performed a narrative review and analyzed the data obtained about clinical outcomes for HD and peritoneal dialysis. For the review, the research team searched the PubMed, EMBASE, and SCOPUS databases. The search used the keywords: end-stage renal disease, renal replacement therapy, hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.The study made in Affiliated Hospital of Hebei University, China.The studies included 15 636 patients who had been diagnosed with LN-ESRD prior to renal transplantation.For the data analysis, the research team divided the data into two groups, one of which included the data on the clinical outcomes for HD patientsand one of which included the data on the clinical outcomes for PD patients. The study evaluated four types of risks: lupus-flare risks, all-cause infection risks, all-cause cardiovascular events risk, and risk of mortality.The 16 studies found in the review reported one or more outcomes of interest for the two dialysis modalities, HD and PD. The analysis of the data from the 16 studies showed that HD was associated with a higher risk than PD: (1) of lupus flares, with RR = 1.23 (confidence interval: 0.82, 1.85), but the difference didn't reach statistical significance (P = .31); (2) of all-cause infection risk, with RR = 1.02 (confidence interval: 0.66, 1.59), but the difference didn't reach statistical significance (P = .92); (3) of all-cause cardiovascular events, with RR = 1.44 (confidence interval: 1.02, 2.04), and the difference reached statistical significance (P = .04); and (4) of mortality risk, with RR = 1.29 (confidence interval: 0.95, 1.75), but the difference didn't reach statistical significance (P = .10).The current study may have reference significance for clinical treatment of ESRD. Except for all-cause cardiovascular events in which PD was superior to HD, offering better outcomes, both treatment modalities provide more or less similar clinical outcomes as effective initial choices for RRT in LN-ESRD patients prior to renal transplant. The current research team, however, encourages further research on the question, addressing better the possible sources of biases encountered in the current study."

After covariate adjustment, the association of age, sex, dialysis vintage, diabetes, and functional status with PROs was similar in both modalities, with women having lower PCS and kidney disease burden scores. Lower functional status (score\u00a0<11) was strongly associated with lower PCS and MCS scores, a much greater burden of kidney disease, and greater likelihood of depression symptoms (CES-D, >10). The median change in KDQOL-based PROs was negligible over 1 year in participants who completed at least 2 annual questionnaires.Selection bias due to incomplete survey responses. Generalizability was limited to the dialysis populations of the included countries.Variation exists in quality of life, burden of kidney disease, and depression across countries but did not appreciably change over time. Functional status remained one of the strongest predictors of all PROs. Routine assessment of functional status may provide valuable insights for patients and providers in anticipating outcomes and support needs for patients receiving either PD or HD."

The aim of this study was to analyze the association between daily haemodialysis and renal transplantation and survival in France.This was an observational cohort study based on the French REIN registry. All incident patients \u226518 years old who started daily haemodialysis in France between 2003 and 2012 were included. Using a propensity score, 575 patients on daily haemodialysis were matched with 1696 patients receiving thrice-weekly haemodialysis. Survival analysis was performed using the Cox model. Access to the renal transplant waiting list and renal transplantation were analyzed using the Fine and Gray model.Daily haemodialysis was not independently associated with reduced access to transplant waiting list, whereas, major comorbidities remained associated with restricted waitlisting after multivariate analysis adjusted for confounding factors. After being waitlisted, the cumulative incidence of renal transplantation was lower for the daily haemodialysis than for the thrice-weekly haemodialysis group (SHR\u00a0=\u00a00.72, 95%CI: 0.56-0.91). The risk of death was significantly higher in the daily haemodialysis group (HR<sub>adjusted</sub> \u00a0=\u00a01.58, 95%CI: 1.4-1.8). Major comorbidities were associated with higher risk of death and lower likelihood of receiving a renal transplant during the follow-up period.Our study showed that in France, the likelihood of undergoing renal transplantation after being waitlisted was lower for patients on daily haemodialysis than those on thrice-weekly haemodialysis. Moreover, daily haemodialysis was associated with higher risk of death, even after taking into account age and all major comorbidities."

    "content": "It is very challenging for resource-limited settings to introduce universal health coverage (UHC), particularly regarding the inclusion of high-cost renal dialysis as part of the UHC benefit package. This paper addresses three issues: (1) whether a setting commits to include renal dialysis in its UHC benefit package and if so, why and how; (2) how to ensure quality of renal dialysis services; and (3) how to improve the quality of life of patients using psychosocial and community interventions.This article reviews experiences of renal dialysis programs in seven settings based on presentations and discussions during the International Forum on Peritoneal Dialysis as a Priority Health Policy in Asia. A literature review was conducted to verify and validate the data as well as to fill information gaps presented in the forum. Five out of the seven settings implemented renal dialysis as part of their benefits package, while the other two have pilots or programs in their nascent stage. Renal replacement therapy has become part of the universal access package because these governments recognize the rising number of chronic kidney disease (CKD) cases, the catastrophically high costs of treatment, and that this is the only life-saving treatment available to patients. The recommendations are as follows: Governments should have a holistic approach to CKD interventions, including primary prevention as well as psychosocial interventions. Governments should consider subsidizing CKD treatment costs depending on their resources. Multi-stakeholder cooperation should be facilitated to enact these policies and conduct research and development for all aspects of interventions. International collaboration should be initiated to share experiences, good practices, and joint activities (e.g. capacity building and multinational procurement of medical supplies).This study provides practical recommendations to country governments as well as the international community on how to meet the demand for good quality renal dialysis as part of UHC in resource-limited settings."

However, there is limited information whether bleeding risks are different for patients treated with haemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD). From a clinical point of view, this information could influence therapy choice. Therefore the aim of this study was to investigate the association between dialysis modality and bleeding risk.Incident dialysis patients from the Netherlands Cooperative Study on the Adequacy of Dialysis were prospectively followed for major bleeding events over 3\u2009years. Hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for HD compared with PD using a time-dependent Cox regression analysis, with updates on dialysis modality.In total, 1745 patients started dialysis, of whom 1211 (69.4%) received HD and 534 (30.6%) PD. The bleeding rate was 60.8/1000 person-years for HD patients and 34.6/1000 person-years for PD patients. The time-dependent Cox regression analysis showed that after adjustment for age, sex, primary kidney disease, prior bleeding, cardiovascular disease, antiplatelet drug use, vitamin K antagonist use, erythropoietin use, arterial hypertension, residual glomerular filtratin rate, haemoglobin and albumin levels, bleeding risk for HD patients compared with PD increased 1.5-fold (95% CI 1.0-2.2).In this large prospective cohort of incident dialysis patients, HD patients had an increased bleeding risk compared with PD patients. In particular, HD patients with a history of prior bleeding had an increased bleeding risk."

Relevant studies published before June 2015 were searched. Pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to evaluate the effect of HD and PD on RA based on five indexes: hemoglobin, ferritin, transferrin saturation index, serum albumin, and parathyroid hormone. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias assessment were conducted to evaluate the stability and reliability of our results. A total of fourteen eligible studies with 1103 cases underwent HD and 625 cases underwent PD were used for this meta-analysis. There were no significant difference for levels of hemoglobin (SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.23, 95% CI: -0.74 to 0.28), ferritin (SMD\u2009=\u20090.01, 95% CI: -0.59 to 0.62), parathyroid hormone (SMD\u2009=\u20090.11, 95% CI: -1.53 to 1.75) and transferrin saturation index (SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.06, 95% CI: -0.67 to 0.56) between HD and PD group. However, the content of serum albumin in HD group was much more than that in PD group (SMD\u2009=\u20091.58, 95% CI: 0.35 to 2.81). Neither of the included studies could reverse the pooled side effect and Egger's test demonstrated no publication bias.

RCA nadired 12-24\u2009h after dialysis and increased during the final 12\u2009h of the inter-dialytic interval through the first 8\u2009h after dialysis. Higher pre-dialysis serum magnesium concentration was associated with lower incidence rate ratio for arrythmia (IRR per 1\u2009mg/dL increase 0.49, 95% CI; 0.25, 0.94), as was dialysate calcium concentration\u2009>\u20092.5\u2009mEq/L vs. 2.5\u2009mEq/L (IRR 0.52, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.70). Neither intradialytic serum potassium nor weight change were significantly associated with RCA rate. However, there was effect modification such that arrhythmia rate was maximal with concurrently high intradialytic volume and potassium removal (P<sub>interaction</sub>\u2009=\u20090.01).Intra and post-dialytic arrhythmias are common in hemodialysis. Additional studies designed to further elucidate whether modification of the serum magnesium concentration, dialysate calcium concentration, and the extent of intradialytic potassium and fluid removal reduces the risk of per-dialytic arrhythmia are warranted.Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01779856.

    "title": "Comparative Analysis of Efficacy and Prognosis of Hemodialysis and Peritoneal Dialysis for End-Stage Renal Disease: A Meta-analysis.",
    "content": "This meta-analysis is aimed at systematically assessing the efficacy and prognosis of hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) in the treatment of end-stage renal disease (ESRD).China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP, SinoMed, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Embase databases were searched for relevant studies to evaluate the two different dialysis methods for ESRD. The search time was set from 2010 to 2021. Meta-analysis was performed using Stata16.0. The treatment group received PD, while the control group was given HD.Out of 317 articles initially retrieved, 14 studies were finally included in our meta-analysis. The analysis results showed that there was no marked difference in the 1-year survival rate between the two groups (RR = 1.05; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.10; <i>P</i> > 0.05), but the incidence rate of adverse reactions in the treatment group was significantly lower than that in the control group (RR = 0.51; 95% CI: 0.37, 0.70; <i>P</i> < 0.05). In addition, PD and HD treatments caused significant decreases in serum creatinine levels (PD, SMD = -2.91; 95% CI: -3.79, -2.04; <i>P</i> < 0.05; HD, SMD = -3.09; 95% CI: -4.01, -2.16; <i>P</i> < 0.05) and blood urea nitrogen levels (PD, SMD = -2.54, 95% CI: -3.37, -1.72, <i>P</i> < 0.05; HD, SMD = -2.62, 95% CI: -3.47, -1.77, <i>P</i> < 0.05); however, there was no significant statistical difference in posttreatment levels of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen between the two groups. Compared with the control group, the hemoglobin (SMD = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.07, 1.06; <i>P</i> < 0.05) and serum albumin (SMD = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.46, 1.76, <i>P</i> < 0.05) levels were significantly increased in the treatment group after treatment.In summary, both PD and HD can improve renal function in uremic patients, but PD is superior to HD in reducing the incidence of adverse reactions, improving the nutritional status, and therefore improving the quality of life of patients."

    "content": "Learned helplessness is an early psychological concept, but in the field of nursing, the concept of learned helplessness in renal dialysis patients and its unique challenges are not well understood.This article provides a conceptual analysis of learned helplessness in renal dialysis patients to increase knowledge of this psychological phenomenon in the setting of renal nursing.Rodgers' evolutionary concept analysis.The literature published in five databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, CNKI) was searched using specific terms. In the first stage, search terms and strategies were used to narrow the relevant articles. In the second stage, the data were extracted from the included articles. In the third stage, the data were analyzed using thematic analysis, and the results were presented in the form of attributes, antecedents, consequences, surrogate terms, and related terms. We found additional instruments and interventions and presented a model case to emphasize the practicality of the concept. In the fourth phase, experts contributed to the discussion and interpretation of the findings.A total of 22 articles were included. Four attributes of learned helplessness in renal dialysis patients were identified: low self-concept, perceived loss, negative cognitive set, and abandonment of action. The antecedents were sociodemographic characteristics, disease and treatment, and psychological factors. Consequences were separated into four themes: psychological problems, physiological problems, quality of life, and health-related behavior. Surrogate terms are hopelessness and powerlessness, and the related term is depression.The process of conceptual analysis in this study provides a means of identifying awareness gaps and practice challenges of learned helplessness in renal dialysis patients and other concepts. The findings can be used to guide the design of tools and interventions to expand the use of learned helplessness theory in nursing."

    "title": "The impact of chronic pre-dialysis hyponatremia on clinical outcomes in maintenance hemodialysis patients.",
    "content": "Chronic pre-dialysis hyponatremia is not rare in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. However, the association between chronic pre-dialysis hyponatremia and mortality is uncertain due to multiple potential confounders such as hyperglycemia, fluid overload, and malnutrition. This study aimed to more comprehensively evaluate the association between chronic pre-dialysis hyponatremia and clinical outcomes in MHD patients.We analyzed the data of 194 MHD patients with regular real-time measurements of pre-dialysis serum sodium from July 2015 to March 2021. Hyponatremia was defined as SNa\u2009\u2264\u2009135\u00a0mmol/L and normonatremia as SNa\u2009>\u2009135\u00a0mmol/L and\u2009<\u2009145\u00a0mmol/L. We evaluated the association of baseline pre-dialysis serum sodium (SNa) and time-averaged SNa (TASNa) levels with all-cause mortality or new major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in MHD patients. Furthermore, the SNa levels were glucose, serum albumin, and fluid overload adjusted. The associations between SNa levels and all-cause mortality or new MACE were analyzed using time-varying Cox regression models.Among the total of 194 patients, 24 patients died and 45 new MACE occurred during a mean 35.2-month follow-up period. The baseline pre-dialysis SNa level was 137.1\u2009\u00b1\u20092.8\u00a0mmol/L (127-144\u00a0mmol/L). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that there were no significant differences in all-cause mortality or new MACE between hyponatremia and normonatremia groups according to baseline pre-dialysis SNa or glucose-corrected SNa (gcSNa). The mean values of both TASNa and time-averaged glucose-corrected SNa (TAgcSNa) were 136.9\u2009\u00b1\u20092.4\u00a0mmol/L and 138.3\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0\u00a0mmol/L, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with pre-dialysis hyponatremia had higher all-cause mortality or new MACE compared with normonatremia patients whether grouped on TASNa or TAgcSNa. Cox models showed an increased risk of all-cause mortality and new MACE in MHD patients with pre-dialysis hyponatremia based on TASNa or TAgcSNa. Even after full adjustment including time-dependent age and dialysis vintage, gender, diabetes, time-averaged weight gain (TAWG), and serum albumin, patients with pre-dialysis hyponatremia based on TASNa (HR 2.89; 95% CI 1.18-7.04; model 3) or TAgcSNa (HR 5.03; 95% CI 1.87-13.57; model 3) had approximately twofold or fourfold greater risk of all-cause mortality, respectively, compared with those with normonatremia. The risk of new MACE was also significantly elevated in patients with pre-dialysis hyponatremia based on TASNa (HR 3.86; 95% CI 2.13-7.01; model 1) or TAgcSNa (HR 2.43; 95% CI 1.14-5.15; model 1). After adjustment for time-dependent age and dialysis vintage, gender, diabetes, TAWG, and serum albumin, patients with pre-dialysis hyponatremia based on TASNa (HR 2.33; 95% CI 1.16-4.68; model 3) had a higher risk of new MACE compared with those with normonatremia.Pre-dialysis time-averaged hyponatremia is independently associated with increased risks of all-cause mortality or new MACE in MHD patients. The baseline SNa level is not a predictor of clinical outcomes due to its variation over time. Hyperglycemia, fluid overload, and malnutrition do not have a significant impact on the risk association between chronic hyponatremia and all-cause mortality or new MACE in MHD patients."

    "content": "Arteriovenous fistula is the most common vascular access for patients requiring hemodialysis, but it is not always possible or practical hence cuffed tunneled dialysis catheter comes into play. The aim of the study was to determine the outcome of cuffed tunneled dialysis catheter used for hemodialysis at a teaching hospital.A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted between January 2014 and December 2019 on 103 chronic dialysis patients with end-stage renal disease presenting to a tertiary care hospital. Ethical approval was received from the institutional review board (2/(6-11) E2/076/77). Whole sampling was done. Data entry and analysis were done in Microsoft Excel 10.The study included 103 patients with 117 cuffed tunneled dialysis catheters placed for hemodialysis. On assessing the outcome of the catheters, the primary and secondary patency rates of the catheters were 5.85\u00b14.87 and 1.21\u00b13.77 months. Thirty-one (30.1%) patients required one intervention, and 11 (10.68%) catheters required 3 or more interventions to maintain patency. Eighteen (17.48%) patients presented with catheter dysfunction while in 11 (10.68%) cases, the catheter was kinked or malpositioned at the notch. In one patient, procedure was abandoned due to severe bleeding and in 2 (1.94%) patients dialysis catheters could not be negotiated into the right atrium and left in brachiocephalic junction.Cuffed tunneled dialysis catheter is effective for maintenance hemodialysis in patients with the end-stage renal disease if used with proper care during dialysis even in our setup. The results and outcomes of the procedure are at par with standards."

    "content": "The status of essential and toxic trace elements in patients with different stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is still unclear and not well characterized. The present study examined the circulatory levels of a wide panel of trace elements (Al, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Rb, Sr, Cd, Pb, and U) in hemodialysis patients (HD group) and pre-dialysis patients with stage 3 CKD (PD group). Comparisons were made between groups of patients and healthy individuals from the control group (CG). The levels of Al, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, As, Se, Sr, and Pb were higher, while the levels of Cr, Zn, Rb, Cd, and U were lower in HD patients than in our CG. Higher levels of Al and Se, as well as lower levels of As, Sr, Zn, Rb, and U were significant and distinguished HD from PD. Among other analyzed elements, Co, Se, and U are the only trace elements that did not distinguish PD from CG at a statistically significant level. The HD group had lower serum U levels than the PD group, and this could be a result of hemodialysis. This study also revealed that the Cu/Zn ratio could be used as a marker for early and late detection of renal failure. Marked changes of essential and toxic trace element levels in sera indicate additional pathophysiological events in CKD, which could additionally contribute to the preexisting increased morbidity of HD patients. Measurement of trace elements in HD patients should be performed routinely."

    "content": "Chronic inflammation and the underlying cardiovascular comorbidity are still current problems in chronic hemodialysis patients. There are few studies comparing the \"dialysis dose\" with the degree of inflammation in the patient. Our main objective was to determine whether there is a relationship between serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and the \"dialysis dose\" (Kt / V) using ionic dialysance.Multicenter cross-sectional study. 536 prevalent chronic hemodialysis patients were included. CRP levels, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were collected. Kt was obtained by ionic dialysance and urea distribution volume was calculated from the Watson's formula. The sample was divided into two groups, taking the median CRP as the cut-off point. Dialysis adequacy obtained in each group was compared. Finally, a logistic regression model was carried out to determine the variables with the greatest influence.Median CRP was 4.10\u2009mg/L (q25-q75: 1.67-10) and mean Kt/V was 1.48\u2009\u00b1\u20090.308. Kt/V was lower in the patients included in the high inflammation group (p\u2009=\u20090.01). In the multivariate logistic regression, the \"high\" levels of CRP were directly correlated with the Log INL (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and inversely proportional with serum albumin values (p\u2009=\u20090.014), Kt/V (p\u2009=\u20090.037) and serum iron (p\u2009<\u20090.001).The poorer adequacy in terms of dialysis doses, lower Kt / V values, may contribute to a higher degree of inflammation in chronic hemodialysis patients."

    "content": "Cancer is a global issue in recent decade. Despite this alarming increase in the incidence of cancer, to date, whether the risk of developing cancer differs among peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) patients is still uncertain. In this retrospective cohort study, data were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan, which provides coverage to almost 99% of the nation's population. After matching, a total of 4491 (or 3369) incident PD patients and 8982 (or 6738) incident HD patients between 2000 and 2009 were enrolled from the database. In addition, 22,455 (or 16,845) nondialysis patients were selected as a control group. The patients were monitored for the occurrence of cancer until 2010, and their data were analyzed using several different models. In general, the results showed that the risks of hepatocellular, kidney, bladder, extra kidney/bladder urinary tract, and thyroid cancers were higher in dialysis patients. We also compared the risk of cancer between two dialysis groups by using the HD patients as the reference group. The result showed that there is no significant different for each cancer risk between two dialysis groups. In conclusion, dialysis patients had a higher risk of certain types of cancer than those in the nonuremia group. However, there was no significant difference in the cancer risk between the two dialysis groups when compared directly."

    "content": "Obesity is a chronic disease that is increasingly prevalent around the world and is a well-recognized risk factor for type 2 diabetes and hypertension, leading causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The obese diabetic patient with ESRD is a challenge for the nephrologist with regard to the type of renal replacement therapy that should be suggested and offered to the patient. There is no evidence that either peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis is contraindicated in obese ESRD patients. In the literature, we can find a discrepancy in the impact of obesity on mortality among hemodialysis vs. peritoneal dialysis patients. Several studies in hemodialysis patients suggest that a higher BMI confers a survival advantage - the so-called \"reverse epidemiology\". In contrast, the literature among obese peritoneal dialysis patients is inconsistent, with various studies reporting an increased risk of death, no difference, or a decreased risk of death. Many of these studies only spanned across a few years, and this is probably too short of a time frame for a realistic assessment of obesity's impact on mortality in ESRD patients. The decision for dialysis modality in an obese diabetic patient with ESRD should be individualized. According to the results of published studies, we cannot suggest PD or HD as a better solution for all obese diabetic patients. The obese patient should be educated about all their dialysis options, including home dialysis therapies. In this review, the available literature related to the dialysis modality in obese patients with diabetes and ESRD was reviewed. "

    "content": "Data on cardiac arrhythmia and electrolyte changes during the dialysis cycle have been limited. Fifty-two hemodialysis (HD) patients underwent 48-h Holter monitoring during early-week and mid-week HD sessions. Pre-HD and post-HD blood samples were collected in both HD sessions. The 48-h Holter data were divided into five phases: (1) 4-h during the early-week HD (HD1), (2) 12-h post-HD1, (3) 16-h period between Phases 2 and 4 (used as the patient's baseline electrocardiography [ECG]), (4) 12-h pre-HD2 phase, and (5) 4-h during the mid-week HD (HD2). The patients' mean age was 68.54\u2009\u00b1\u200913.37\u2009years. We found that the dialysate-to-serum[K] gradient and changes of S[K] were significantly higher in HD1 than in HD2, as well as changes of S[Mg]. There were no significant ECG changes during the 4-h HD1 and HD2 when compared with the baseline ECG. Phase 2 of Holter ECG was the most common phase that showed significant changes (increased QT interval dispersion (QTD), increased ventricular events, increased number of premature ventricular contractions, ST elevation and ST depression), which was contributed from the dialysate[K] 2\u2009mmol/L subgroup, but not the dialysate[K] 3\u2009mmol/L subgroup. In the subgroup of patients with a high ultrafiltration rate (UFR; mean UFR \u226510\u00a0mL/kg/h), there were significantly increased ventricular events and ST-segment changes in Phase 2. In conclusion, ECG changes were associated with the dialysis cycle, significantly in the 12-h after early-week HD sessions. These may be associated with low dialysate[K] or high dialysate-to-S[K] gradient, high ultrafiltration rate and duration of the interdialytic interval."

    "content": "Patients with chronic renal failure are commonly cared using a blood filtration mechanism like hemodialysis. Little information is available regarding ocular changes following hemodialysis for people with chronic renal failure. Accordingly, this study intended to estimate the pre- and post-hemodialysis thickness of retina and choroid and other ocular findings in patients with chronic renal failure.This research is a \"before and after\" clinical experiment, without control. This prospective study was conducted on patients with chronic renal failure who were in Imam Khomeini Hospital for hemodialysis in 2017. The sample size of this study was estimated to be 67 (134 eyes). In this study, after acquiring consent (by the associated assistant) from all patients, thorough ocular examinations including IOP control, VA and fundus examination, reflection, and macula and choroid OCT were performed 30\u00a0min before and after hemodialysis and entered in SPSS V. 16 software by the project manager. Finally, these data were analyzed practicing T-pair tests or their nonparametric equivalent, the Wilcoxon test.Based on the results of this examination, studying 67 participating patients, 134 eyes were examined, of which 80 eyes (59.8%) belonged to men, and 54 eyes (40.2%) belonged to women. The mean and standard deviation of participants' age in the study was reported to be 57.3\u2009\u00b1\u200915\u00a0years, and the dialysis duration was 3.0\u2009\u00b1\u20092.11\u00a0h. According to the Wilcoxon test, the average rank in terms of weight, patient temperature, pulse, blood sugar, urea, potassium, ocular pressure, 500-micron nasal choroidal thickness, and myopia in diopter vary significantly before and after dialysis (p\u2009<\u20090.05). However, according to the Wilcoxon test, choroidal thickness in the subfoveal area of the eye (p\u2009=\u20090.600), the retinal thickness in the subfoveal area (p\u2009=\u20090.839), the amount of astigmatism in diopter (p\u2009=\u20090.757) and the amount of hypermetropia in diopter (p\u2009=\u20090.068) before and after dialysis do not have a significant difference. Based on the t test, it was reported that the average creatinine score, the best corrected vision, and the 500 and 1000-micron temporal and nasal choroidal thickness had a significant difference (p\u2009<\u20090.05).Based on the results of the current study, it was settled that the corrected vision, ocular pressure, as well as the 500-micron nasal choroidal thickness, and myopia in diopter and the 1000-micron temporal and nasal choroidal thickness of patients before and after hemodialysis vary. This difference shows the impact of hemodialysis on changes in ocular characteristics in patients with renal insufficiency."

Two sample t-tests were used to compare most outcomes of the cohorts with a Mann-Whitney U test used for skewed data. Nephrology group outcomes were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis and chi-square tests.There were 98 encounters in the historical cohort and 143 encounters in the fast track dialysis cohort. FTD had significantly lowered median ED LOS (4.05\u00a0h, vs 5.3\u00a0h, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), median hospital LOS (12.8\u00a0h vs 27\u00a0h, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), time to hemodialysis (4.78\u00a0h vs 7.29\u00a0h, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and median hospital charges ($26,040 vs $30,747, p\u00a0<\u00a00.016). The FTD cohort had increased 30 day ED return for each encounter compared to the historical cohort (1.85 visits vs 0.73 visits, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), however no significant increase in 1\u00a0year ED visits (6.52 visits vs 5.80, p\u00a0=\u00a00.4589) or 1 year readmissions (5.89 readmissions vs 4.81 readmissions, p\u00a0=\u00a00.3584). Most nephrology groups had significantly lower time to hemodialysis order placement and time to start hemodialysis.A multidisciplinary approach with key stakeholders using a standard pathway can lead to improved efficiency in throughput, reduced charges, and hospital resource utilization for patients needing urgent or routine hemodialysis. A study with a dedicated geographic observation unit for protocolized short stay patients including conditions ranging from low risk chest pain to transient ischemic events that incorporates FTD patients under this protocol should be considered."

Therefore, we made a meta-analysis to determine the efficacy in patients with hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD) and renal transplant recipient (RT). The sero-protection rate was used as a serologic parameter to describe the immune response to the vaccine. Statistical analysis was performed to calculate the pooled rate difference (RD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). The pooled RD for the H1N1, H3N2 and B influenza vaccines was 0.02 (95% CI: -0.02-0.06), 0.05 (95% CI: -0.01-0.11), 0.04 (95% CI: -0.02-0.10), respectively. We concluded that a booster dose of the influenza vaccine did not effectively enhance immunogenicity. Therefore, a booster dose of vaccine is not recommended for patients with hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and renal transplant recipients."

Unadjusted estimates of the probability of free from dialysis and overall survival were computed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests. Cox proportional-hazards regression models were used in determining the risk factors associated with ESRD and mortality.During a mean 9.3 months follow-up duration, the hemodialysis group had significantly better free from dialysis (85.6% vs. 64.4%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and overall survival (85.4% vs. 78.5%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.008) rates than the control group. Cox proportional-hazards regression analyses of the propensity score-matched patients showed that the hemodialysis group had reduced risks for ESRD and mortality (hazard ratios, 0.32 and 0.48, respectively).Prophylactic Hemodialysis following coronary angiography was associated with reduced ESRD and mortality risks in CKD patients with CAD, who did not routinely undergo dialysis."

    "content": "Adrenal insufficiency in hemodialysis patients is commonly encountered in clinical practice. However, its association with end-stage renal disease is unclear. We investigated the relationship between adrenal function and relevant clinical parameters, focusing on dialysis vintage.Altogether, 100 maintenance hemodialysis patients were enrolled (age: 69.8\u2009\u00b1\u200911.8\u00a0years, dialysis vintage: 9.4\u2009\u00b1\u20099.2\u00a0years). Basal serum cortisol levels were measured and their associations with relevant clinical parameters were investigated. Subsequently, hormone stimulation tests were performed to assess adrenal function.Basal serum cortisol significantly decreased with an increase in dialysis vintage (<\u200910\u00a0years, 11.9\u2009\u00b1\u20093.7\u00a0\u03bcg/dL; 10-19\u00a0years, 10.9\u2009\u00b1\u20092.9\u00a0\u03bcg/dL;\u2009\u2265\u200920\u00a0years, 9.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.8\u00a0\u03bcg/dL). Basal cortisol was negatively correlated with dry weight, \u03b22-microglobulin, creatinine, and lymphocyte count and positively correlated with brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity. Significant negative correlations were observed between basal cortisol and dialysis vintage after adjusting for confounding variables in the multivariate analysis. Standard adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation tests were performed in 17 patients. Seven patients were diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency and all of them had a long dialysis vintage (\u2265\u200910\u00a0years). According to the rapid ACTH test, cortisol responses were significantly decreased in patients with long dialysis vintage compared to those with short dialysis vintage (<\u200910\u00a0years). Similar findings were observed in ten patients without adrenal insufficiency. The CRH loading test showed similar tendencies, although the differences were not statistically significant.Adrenal function decreased with an increase in dialysis vintage. Long-term dialysis patients might be susceptible to adrenal insufficiency."

    "title": "Extended-Hours Hemodialysis without Dietary Restrictions Is Associated with Lower Risk for Developing of Dialysis-Related Amyloidosis.",
    "content": "Dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA) is characterized by the deposition of amyloid consisting of beta2-microglobulin in the musculoskeletal system, causing carpal tunnel syndrome, destructive spondyloarthropathy, and/or bone cysts. Increased cystic radiolucency of the bones and tendon thickening due to inflammation are common findings in DRA. We have developed a new dialysis method, extended-hours hemodialysis without dietary restrictions for the aim of improving both hypertension and malnutrition. We retrospectively evaluated the clinical effects of dialysis time on the risk for developing of DRA. The study subjects were all of the 30 patients who had received this treatment for more than 11 years. They were divided into two groups according to the weekly dialysis hours: 15 patients \u2265 16.5 hours/week (L-group) and 15 patients \u2264 15.5 hours/week (S-group). Plain x-ray imaging and ultrasonography were used to assess cystic radiolucency of the bones and thickness/diameter of the soft tissues. The proportion of the carpal bone cystic radiolucency was lower in the L-group. The severity of median nerve compression at the wrist was significantly less in the L-group (right hand: p = 0.0082, left hand: p = 0.0137). Multivariate regression analysis showed that dialysis time was a predictor of median nerve compression (\u03b2 = -0.559, p = 0.005). In conclusion, extended-hours hemodialysis without dietary restrictions contributes to lower the risk for developing of DRA at the wrist. We therefore propose that extended-hours hemodialysis without dietary restrictions is a preferred method which maintains the patients' quality of life compared with the conventional hemodialysis method."

    "content": "Ambulatory pulse-wave velocity (PWV), augmentation pressure, and augmentation index (AIx) are associated with increased cardiovascular events and death in hemodialysis. The intermittent nature of hemodialysis generates a distinct ambulatory pattern, with a progressive increase of augmentation pressure and AIx during the interdialytic interval. No study so far has compared the ambulatory course of central hemodynamics and PWV between peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis patients.Thirty-eight patients under peritoneal dialysis and 76 patients under hemodialysis matched in a 1\u200a:\u200a2 ratio for age, sex and dialysis vintage underwent 48-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring with the oscillometric Mobil-O-Graph device. Parameters of central hemodynamics [central SBP, DBP and pulse pressure (PP)], wave reflection [AIx, heart rate-adjusted AIx; AIx(75) and augmentation pressure] and PWV were estimated from the 48-h recordings.Over the total 48-h period, no significant differences were observed between peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis patients in mean levels of central SBP, DBP, PP, augmentation pressure, AIx, AIx(75) and PWV. However, patients under peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis displayed different trajectories in all the above parameters over the course of the recording: in peritoneal dialysis patients no differences were noted in central SBP (125.0\u200a\u00b1\u200a19.2 vs. 126.0\u200a\u00b1\u200a17.8\u200ammHg, P\u200a=\u200a0.25), DBP, PP, augmentation pressure (13.0\u200a\u00b1\u200a6.8 vs. 13.7\u200a\u00b1\u200a7.\u200ammHg, P\u200a=\u200a0.15), AIx(75) (25.9\u200a\u00b1\u200a6.9 vs. 26.3\u200a\u00b1\u200a7.8%, P\u200a=\u200a0.54) and PWV (9.5\u200a\u00b1\u200a2.1 vs. 9.6\u200a\u00b1\u200a2.1\u200am/s, P\u200a=\u200a0.27) from the first to the second 24-h period of the recording. In contrast, hemodialysis patients showed significant increases in all these parameters from the first to second 24 h (SBP: 119.5\u200a\u00b1\u200a14.4 vs. 124.6\u200a\u00b1\u200a15.0\u200ammHg, P\u200a<\u200a0.001; augmentation pressure: 10.9\u200a\u00b1\u200a5.3 vs. 13.1\u200a\u00b1\u200a6.3\u200ammHg, P\u200a<\u200a0.001; AIx(75): 24.7\u200a\u00b1\u200a7.6 vs. 27.4\u200a\u00b1\u200a7.9%, P\u200a<\u200a0.001; PWV: 9.1\u200a\u00b1\u200a1.8 vs. 9.3\u200a\u00b1\u200a1.8\u200am/s, P\u200a<\u200a0.001). Peritoneal dialysis patients had numerically higher levels than hemodialysis patients in all the above parameters during all periods studied and especially during the first 24-h.Central BP, wave reflection indices and PWV during a 48-h recording are steady in peritoneal dialysis but gradually increase in hemodialysis patients. During all studied periods, peritoneal dialysis patients have numerically higher levels of all studied parameters, a fact that could relate to higher cardiovascular risk."

The aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence of musculoskeletal manifestations in hemodialysis patients and identify disease cluster profiles. We performed a cross-sectional study including all adult patients in the hemodialysis unit at Hotel-Dieu de France Hospital. We collected demographic characteristics, musculoskeletal symptoms, biologic parameters, and treatments. Musculoskeletal disorders were classified by a rheumatologist into predefined diagnostic categories. Prevalence was presented, and a cluster analysis was performed. Eighty-nine patients were included, mean age was 67.5\u2009\u00b1\u200912\u00a0years, and 43.8% were female. Dialysis vintage was 5.7\u2009\u00b1\u20095.37\u00a0years. Musculoskeletal symptoms were reported by 76.4% of the patients. Pain was the most frequent symptom (44.9%). The main diagnoses were osteoarthritis (53.9%) and fracture (27%). Musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders were significantly associated with dialysis vintage and age. Cluster analysis identified three patient profiles: younger with low calcium levels, younger but long dialysis vintage with osteoarthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome, and older with long dialysis vintage and fractures.

    "content": "An overlap between the somatic symptoms of depression and those of uremia seen in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients may affect the diagnosis of depression. This study aims to evaluate the effect of hemodialysis on the diagnosis of depression among patients on maintenance hemodialysis as dialysis diminishes the uremic symptoms, and to compare depression scores before and after dialysis.This was a cross-sectional analytic study conducted from November 2018 through April 2019, in three tertiary hospitals. Consenting participants aged 18\u2009years or older, who had received hemodialysis for at least three months were included. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) tool was used to collect patients' data and to identify symptoms of depression Pre- and post-hemodialysis. Depression scores were compared using the paired sample Wilcoxon rank test or the McNemar test, where appropriate.Overall, 163 participants were enrolled in the study. The average age of the participants was 56.5\u2009years old, whereas 44.8% were females. The prevalence of depressive symptoms before hemodialysis was 48.5%, with prevalence of mild, moderate and moderately severe of 34.4%, 11.7% and 2.5%, respectively. On the other hand, the prevalence of depressive symptoms after hemodialysis was 46.6% with 36.8%, 9.2% and 0.6% of the participants reporting mild, moderate and moderately severe symptoms, respectively. We found no significant difference in depression scores before and after dialysis (p-values\u2009>\u20090.05).Our study supports the fact that the prevalence of depression is high among patients with ESRD on maintenance hemodialysis. We didn't find a significant difference in depression scores among hemodialysis patients before and after dialysis, with negligible effect of uremic symptoms on the diagnosis of depression. We suggest adopting routine screening of depression among this high-risk group of patients."

The purpose of this study was to quantify the inflammatory burden that periodontitis causes in dialysis patients and to examine whether patients on PD and HD differ in terms of the periodontal inflamed surface area (PISA), which can be helpful for selecting the most appropriate dialysis modality.A cross-sectional study was performed on 58 consecutive patients on HD and 31 consecutive patients on PD.

    "title": "Routine assessment of kidney urea clearance, dialysis dose and protein catabolic rate in the once-weekly haemodialysis regimen.",
    "content": "The dialysis dose (Kt/V) and normalized protein catabolic rate (PCRn) are the most useful indices derived from the urea kinetic model (UKM) in haemodialysis (HD) patients. The kidney urea clearance (Kru) is another important UKM parameter which plays a key role in the prescription of incremental HD. Ideally, the three kinetic parameters should be assessed using the complex software Solute Solver based on the double pool UKM. In the clinical setting, however, the three indices are estimated with simplified formulae. The recently introduced software SPEEDY assembles the aforementioned equations in a plain spreadsheet, to produce quite accurate results of Kru, Kt/V and PCRn. Unfortunately, specific equations to compute Kt/V and PCRn for patients on a once-weekly HD regimen (1HD/wk) were not available at the time SPEEDY was built-up. We devised a new version of SPEEDY (SPEEDY-1) and an even simpler variant (SPEEDY-1S), using two recently published equations for the 1HD/wk schedule . Moreover, we also added a published equation to estimate the equivalent renal clearance (EKR) normalized to urea distribution volume (V) of 35 L (EKR<sub>35</sub>) from Kru and Kt/V . Aim of the present study was to compare the results obtained using the new methods (SPEEDY-1 and SPEEDY-1S) with those provided by the reference method Solute Solver.One hundred historical patients being treated with the once-weekly HD regimen were enrolled. A total of 500 HD sessions associated to the availability of monthly UKM studies were analysed in order to obtain Kru, single pool Kt/V (spKt/V), equilibrated Kt/V (eKt/V), V, PCRn and EKR<sub>35</sub> values by using Solute Solver, SPEEDY-1 and SPEEDY-1S.When comparing the paired values of the above UKM parameters, as computed by SPEEDY-1 and Solute Solver, respectively, all differences but one were statistically significant at the one-sample t-test; however, the agreement limits at Bland-Altman analysis showed that all differences were negligible. When comparing the paired values of the above UKM parameters, as computed by SPEEDY-1S and Solute Solver, respectively, all differences were statistically significant; however, the agreement limits showed that the differences were negligible as far as Kru, spKt/V and eKt/V are concerned, though much larger regarding V, PCRn and EKR<sub>35</sub>.We implemented SPEEDY with a new version specific for the once-weekly HD regimen, SPEEDY-1. It provides accurate results and is presently\u00a0the best alternative to Solute Solver. Using SPEEDY-1S led to a larger difference in PCRn and EKR<sub>35</sub>, which could be acceptable for clinical practice if SPEEDY-1 is not available."

The patients' sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, history of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the previous year, death event, source of death (SARS-CoV-2 or not), presence of hospitalization due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, need for intensive care unit, need for ventilatory support in intensive care unit were obtained from the clinical file records.85 of the 200 patients had a history of SARS-Cov-2 infection during the last 12\u00a0months. Forty-two (49.5%) patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were hospitalized. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 had longer dialysis time, increased mortality, and significantly higher comorbidities such as coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure. Besides, heart failure and hypertension were the determining factors in the risk factor analysis for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In dialysis patients, the mortality rate in the last year, due to all causes, including SARS-CoV-2 infection, was 23% while the mortality rate due to \"SARS-CoV-2 infection only\" was 13%) (p > 0.05).

    "content": "Despite several studies reporting similar outcomes for peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD), the former is underused worldwide, with a PD prevalence of 15% in Italy. In 2008, the Unit of Nephrology and Dialysis of the Healthcare Trust of the Autonomous Province of Trento implemented a successful PD program which has increased the proportion of PD incident patients from 7 to 47%. We aimed to assess the effect of this extensive use of PD by comparing HD and PD in terms of survival and time-to-transplantation.A total of 334 HD and 153 PD incident patients were enrolled between January 2008 and December 2014. After screening for exclusion criteria and propensity score matching, 279 HD and 132 PD patients were analyzed. Survival and time-to-transplantation were assessed by competing-risks regression models, using death and transplantation as primary and competing events.Crude and adjusted regression models for survival revealed the absence of significant differences between HD and PD cumulative incidence functions (subhazard ratio: 1.09, p\u2009=\u20090.62 and 1.34, p\u2009=\u20090.10, respectively). Differently, crude and adjusted regression models for transplantation revealed a lower time-to-transplantation for PD versus HD patients (subhazard ratio: 2.34, p\u2009<\u20090.01, and 2.57, p\u2009<\u20090.01, respectively). The waiting time for placement in the transplant waiting list was longer in HD than PD patients (330 vs. 224 days, p\u2009<\u20090.01).The extensive use of PD did not lead to any statistically significant difference in mortality. Furthermore, PD was associated with lower time to transplantation. PD may be a viable option for large-scale dialytic treatment in the advanced chronic kidney disease population."

The mean duration from graft implantation to graft cannulation in the BCAG and PTFE group was 12.3 \u00b1 8.5 days versus 43.5 \u00b1 16.4, respectively ( P = .01). Bovine carotid artery graft group had a higher 2-year primary patency rate (33% vs 14%, P = .03) and assisted primary rate (57% vs 23%, P = .02) compared to the PTFE group. The 2-year secondary patency rates were similar between the 2 groups (56% vs 53%, P = .69). Complication rates in the BCAG and PTFE group was 1.69 \u00b1 0.24 per patient-year versus 2.54 \u00b1 0.48 per patient-year, respectively ( P = .01). Tunneled dialysis catheter-related infection was greater in the PTFE group compared to the BCAG group (10.87 \u00b1 2.61 vs 5.69 \u00b1 0.98 per 1000 TDC days; P = .02). Bovine carotid artery graft cohorts group required a mean of 1.69 interventions per patient-year, compared to 2.76 per patient-year for the PTFE group ( P = .03).Bovine carotid artery graft permits earlier cannulation for hemodialysis access with superior primary and assisted primary patency rates compared to PTFE grafts. Patients with BCAG experienced shorter indwelling TDC duration and less TDC-related complications compared to PTFE cohorts."

    "content": "This study aims to investigate the point prevalence of fibromyalgia in patients on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis and after renal transplantation compared to healthy controls and to evaluate depressive symptoms, anxiety level, and the impact of fibromyalgia on quality of life (QoL).Between January 2018 and January 2019, a total of 107 hemodialysis patients (Group 1) (48 males, 59 females; median age: 50 years; range, 42 to 56 years), 51 peritoneal dialysis patients (Group 2) (32 males, 19 females; median age: 49 years; range, 39 to 54 years), 52 renal transplant patients (Group 3) (23 males, 29 females; median age: 45.5 years; range, 37 to 52 years), and 50 healthy controls (Group 4) (23 males, 27 females; median age: 46.5 years; range, 42 to 50 years) were included in the study. Age, sex, amount of time spent on dialysis, and laboratory data were recorded. Impact of fibromyalgia on QoL was evaluated using the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), while depressive symptoms and anxiety level were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), respectively.The point prevalence of fibromyalgia was 14% in Group 1 (n=15), 5.9% in Group 2 (n=3), 9.6% in Group 3 (n=5), and 4% in Group 4. There was a significant difference in the point prevalence of fibromyalgia between the hemodialysis group and healthy controls (p<0.05). The median FIQ scores were significantly higher in all patient groups than Group 4 (p<0.001); however, there was no significant difference between the patient groups (p>0.05). The median BDI scores were significantly higher in Group 1 and Group 2 than Group 4 (p<0.05). The median BAI scores were significantly higher in Group 1 than Group 4 (p<0.05). When the patients with and without fibromyalgia were compared, FIQ and BAI in Group 1, BAI in Group 2, and FIQ in Group 3 significantly differed (p<0.05). There was no relationship between fibromyalgia and any of the laboratory data, age, or time spent on dialysis (p>0.05).Fibromyalgia is significantly more common among hemodialysis patients than healthy individuals with a similar prevalence to the healthy individuals for peritoneal dialysis and renal transplant patients. The presence of fibromyalgia is related to depressive symptoms, anxiety, and higher impact on QoL for patients with chronic kidney disease."

    "content": "Little is known about the impact of haemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We compared HRQoL between conventional in-centre HD and home-based PD in 1082 newly diagnosed kidney failure patients.This was an open-label, randomised, non-inferiority trial of adult patients with a diagnosis of end-stage kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate \u2264 15 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) requiring maintenance dialysis from 36 sites in China randomised 1:1 to receive PD or conventional in-centre HD. The primary outcome was the 'Burden of Kidney Disease' assessed using the Kidney Disease Quality of Life-Short Form (KDQoL-SF) survey over 48 weeks and the main secondary outcomes were the remaining scales of KDQoL-SF and all-cause mortality. The effect of PD versus HD on the primary outcome was compared by their geometric mean (GM) ratio, and non-inferiority was defined by the lower bound of a one-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) >0.9.A total of 725 subjects completed the trial per protocol (395 PD and 330 HD, mean age 49.8 (standard deviation (SD) 14.4) years, 41.4% women). For the primary outcome, the mean (SD) change in 'Burden of Kidney Disease' over 48 weeks was 2.61 (1.27) in PD group and 2.58 (1.35) in HD group, and the GM ratio (95% CI) was 1.059 (0.908-1.234), exceeding the limit for non-inferiority. For the secondary outcomes, the PD and HD groups were similar in all scales. There were 17 and 31 deaths in PD and HD groups, respectively. Patients receiving PD had more adverse events, adverse event leading to hospitalisation and serious adverse events compared to those allocated to HD, but adverse events leading to death and discontinuation of the trial were not different between PD and HD.In this trial, PD may be non-inferior to HD on the 'Burden of Kidney Disease' among Chinese kidney failure patients who are of younger age and have lower comorbidity after 48 weeks' follow-up."

    "content": "The Ontario Renal Network (ORN), a provincial government agency in Ontario, Canada, launched an initiative in 2012 to increase home dialysis use province-wide. The initiative included a new modality-based funding formula, a standard mandatory informatics system, targets for prevalent home dialysis rates, the development of a 'network' of renal programmes with commitment to home dialysis and a culture of accountability with frequent meetings between ORN and each renal programme leadership to review their results. It also included funding of home dialysis coordinators, encouragement and funding of assisted peritoneal dialysis (PD), and support for catheter insertion and urgent start PD. Between 2012 and 2017, home dialysis use rose from 21.9% to 26.5% and then between 2017 and 2019 stabilised at 26% to 26.5%. Over 7 years, the absolute number of people on home dialysis increased 40% from 2222 to 3105, while the number on facility haemodialysis grew 11% from 7935 to 8767. PD prevalence rose from 16.6% to 20.9%, a relative increase of 25%. The initiative showed that a sustained multifaceted approach can increase home dialysis utilisation."

    "content": "New medications for anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are desirable, owing to the limitations of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), the current standard of care. Molidustat is a novel hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitor that stimulates erythropoietin production, predominately in the kidney. We report methodological details of three phase III trials, named MolIdustat once dailY improves renal Anaemia By Inducing erythropoietin (MIYABI), designed primarily to investigate the efficacy of molidustat therapy in adults with renal anaemia and dialysis-dependent CKD.MIYABI Haemodialysis-Correction (HD-C) is a single-arm trial (24-week treatment duration) in approximately 25 patients on haemodialysis, currently untreated with ESAs. MIYABI Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) is a single-arm trial (36\u2009week treatment duration) in approximately 50 patients on peritoneal dialysis, treated or untreated with ESAs. MIYABI Haemodialysis-Maintenance (HD-M) is a randomised, active-controlled, double-blinded, double-dummy trial (52-week treatment duration) comparing molidustat with darbepoetin alfa in approximately 225 patients on haemodialysis, treated with ESAs. Molidustat (starting dose 75\u2009mg/day) will be titrated 4-weekly to maintain haemoglobin in predetermined target ranges. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of molidustat, using the following measures: the rate of rise in haemoglobin (g/L/week) at the first dose change up to week 8 (MIYABI HD-C); responder rate (MIYABI HD-C and MIYABI PD); mean haemoglobin level during weeks 33-36 and non-inferiority to darbepoetin alfa shown by change in mean haemoglobin level from baseline (MIYABI HD-M). The secondary objectives are to assess safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. These trials will provide the first evaluations of molidustat therapy in patients receiving either peritoneal dialysis or currently untreated with ESAs on haemodialysis, and provide further evidence in patients treated with ESAs on haemodialysis.The protocols were approved by ethics committees at all participating sites. The trials will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. Results arising from these studies will be published in peer-reviewed journal(s).NCT03351166; Pre-results, NCT03418168; Pre-results, NCT03543657; Pre-results."

    "content": "Infection is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease, especially who were under dialysis due to their depressed immunity. Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous parasite that causes severe manifestations in immunocompromised patients. This case-control study was conducted to the immunodiagnosis and molecular validation of T. gondii infection among patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing haemodialysis. The study population consisted of 260 haemodialysis patients and 259 healthy controls referred to the main dialysis centres of Tehran, Iran during 2016. Anti-T. gondii immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. As well, the T. gondii genomic DNA in whole blood samples of IgM-positive patients and healthy controls was evaluated using GRA6-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and SAG1-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays. The anti-T. gondii IgG and IgM antibodies were detected in 175 (67.3%) and 18 (7%) of haemodialysis patients and 122 (47%) and 4 (1.5%) of controls, respectively. Two of the 18 blood samples from IgM-positive patients and none of the IgM-positive control subjects were positive by GRA6-PCR. Whereas, nine and two blood samples of IgM-positive patients and controls were positive for Toxoplasma DNA by a SAG1-LAMP technique respectively. The seropositivity of the Toxoplasma IgM antibody was significantly different between haemodialysis patients and healthy controls which was confirmed by PCR and LAMP. The higher prevalence of T. gondii infection in haemodialysis patients compared with the controls proposes that these patients can be a group at risk for toxoplasmosis and screening for toxoplasmosis before dialysis is necessary for the patients."

    "content": "Clinical trials are most informative for evidence-based decision-making when they consistently measure and report outcomes of relevance to stakeholders, especially patients, clinicians, and policy makers. However, sometimes terminology used is interpreted differently by different stakeholders, which might lead to confusion during shared decision making. The construct dialysis adequacy is frequently used, suggesting it is an important outcome both for health care professionals as for patients.To assess the scope and consistency of the construct dialysis adequacy as reported in randomised controlled trials in hemodialysis, and evaluate whether these align to the insights and understanding of this construct by patients.To assess scope and consistency of dialysis adequacy by professionals, we performed a systematic review searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to July 2017. We identified all randomised controlled trails (RCT) including patients on hemodialysis and reporting dialysis adequacy, adequacy or adequacy of dialysis and extracted and classified all reported outcomes. To explore interpretation and meaning of the construct of adequacy by patients, we conducted 11 semi-structured interviews with HD patients using thematic analysis. Belgian registration number B670201731001.From the 31 included trials, we extracted and classified 98 outcome measures defined by the authors as adequacy of dialysis, of which 94 (95%) were biochemical, 3 (3%) non-biochemical surrogate and 2 (2%) patient-relevant. The three most commonly reported measures were all biochemical. None of the studies defined adequacy of dialysis as a patient relevant outcome such as survival or quality of life. Patients had a substantially different understanding of the construct dialysis adequacy than the biochemical interpretation reported in the literature. Being alive, time spent while being on dialysis, fatigue and friendliness of staff were the most prominent themes that patients linked to the construct of dialysis adequacy.Adequacy of dialysis as reported in the literature refers to biochemical outcome measures, most of which are not related with patient relevant outcomes. For patients, adequate dialysis is a dialysis that enables them to spend as much quality time in their life as possible."

This study aims to measure the health utilities and to identify socio-demographic and clinical factors associated with HRQOL for haemodialysis (HD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) in Malaysia.A total of 141 patients (77 HD and 64 CAPD) from 1 federal and four state hospitals participated in this cross-sectional study. Patients were randomly selected from the National Renal Registry (NRR) using a stratified random sampling. The EQ-5D-3\u2009L questionnaire was used to measure HRQOL. Variables investigated include dialysis modalities, sociodemographic characteristics, co-morbidities and biochemical markers. Utilities are measured on an ordinal scale of 0-1, where 1 indicates full health and 0 indicates death.The mean utility scores were 0.854\u2009\u00b1\u20090.181 and 0.905\u2009\u00b1\u20090.124 (p\u2009>\u20090.05) and the mean Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores were 76.2\u2009\u00b1\u200912.90 and 77.1\u2009\u00b1\u200910.26 (p\u2009>\u20090.05) for HD and CAPD patients respectively. There was a significant difference in problems reported between HD (35.1%) and CAPD (15.6%) on usual activities dimension (p\u2009=\u20090.009). The proportion of patients having problems in the pain/discomfort domain in both modalities was high (34.0%).

    "content": "Expanded hemodialysis (HDx) has a high capacity for removing medium and medium-large molecules; however, there are no specific recommendations during HDx for anticoagulation of the dialysis circuit. We aimed to evaluate the differences in the efficacy of anticoagulation procedures using the venous port and 40\u2009mg enoxaparin in HDx compared to high-flux hemodialysis (HF-HD) and postdilution online hemodiafiltration (HDF). We compared anticoagulant activity in 11 patients in HDx, HF-HD, and HDF under similar dialysis conditions. In the 33 dialysis sessions, 40\u2009mg enoxaparin was administered through the venous port, and pre- and postdialysis antifactor Xa activity (aXa) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), postdialysis clotting time of the vascular access, visual clotting score of the dialyzer, and any complications with the extracorporeal circuit or bleeding were registered. APTT postdialysis in HDx was not significantly different from that in HF-HD and HDF. Postdialysis aXa in HDx was not significantly different from that in HF-HD and HDF. We found no significant differences in visual clotting score of the dialyzer. Enoxaparin administered through the venous port was sufficient for anticoagulation within the extracorporeal circuit in HDx, HF-HD, and HDF. There were no differences in postdialysis aXa or APTT, most likely because when low molecular-weight heparin is applied through venous port, lesser enoxaparin concentration reaches the dialyzer. Thus, we conclude that the dose of enoxaparin administered through the venous port should not be adjusted according to dialysis technique."

    "content": "Renal replacement therapy in India is predominantly a private health-care-driven initiative making it an expensive treatment option due to high out-of-pocket expenditures. Moreover, with the rapid increase in the number of chronic kidney disease patients requiring dialysis, hemodialysis units (HDUs) are getting saturated. Community \"stand-alone\" dialysis centers could be an important alternative to HDUs in meeting the growing demand in an affordable model. The aim of this study was to find hemodialysis (HD) delivery in \"stand-alone\" dialysis units (SAUs) with respect to expanding coverage, patient costs, and patient safety safeguards. The total number of HD sessions was collected at three points. The information regarding patient safety safeguards at SAUs and impact of SAUs on patient costs were collected by interviews and from hospital records. There was 11.5 times increase in HD sessions from 2008 to 2017, out of which 75.3% was provided at SAUs. Following objective clinical and safety measures, high-quality dialysis was delivered at SAUs and it significantly reduced the mean patient cost of treatment per session."

    "content": "Hemodialysis is the main approach for renal replacement therapy in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in China. The timing of dialysis initiation is one of the key factors influencing patient survival and prognosis. Over the past decade, the relationship between the timing of dialysis initiation and mortality has remained unclear in patients with ESRD in China.Patients who commenced maintenance hemodialysis from 2009 to 2014 from 24 hemodialysis centers in Mainland China were enrolled in the study (n = 1,674). Patients were divided into 2 groups based on the year they started hemodialysis (patients who started hemodialysis from 2009 to 2011, and patients who started hemodialysis from 2012 to 2014). Analysis of the yearly change in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at the initiation of dialysis was performed for the 2 groups. Meanwhile, the patients were divided into 3 groups based on their eGFR at the initiation of dialysis (<4, 4-8, and >8 mL/min/1.73 m2). For these 3 groups, the relationship between the eGFR at the start of dialysis and mortality were analyzed.The average eGFRs were 5.68 and 5.94 mL/min/1.73 m2 for 2009-2011 and 2012-2014, respectively. Compared with the 2009-2011 group, the proportion of patients with diabetes in 2012-2014 increased from 26.7 to 37.7%. The prognosis of patients with different eGFRs at the start of dialysis was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. After adjusting for confounding factors through a Cox regression model, no significant difference was demonstrated among the 3 groups (<4 mL/min/1.73 m2 was used as the reference, in comparison with 4-8 mL/min/1.73 m2 [p = 0.681] and >8 mL/min/1.73 m2 [p = 0.403]).In Mainland China, the eGFR at the start of dialysis did not change significantly over time from 2008 to 2014 and had no association with the mortality of patients with ESRD."

    "content": "Among kidney disease patients \u226580 years progressing to end-stage renal disease, there is growing interest in conservative nondialytic management approaches. However, among those who have initiated hemodialysis, little is known about the impact of withdrawal from dialysis on mortality, nor the patient characteristics associated with withdrawal from dialysis.Historical cohort study.We examined 133,162 incident hemodialysis patients receiving care within a large national dialysis organization from 2007 to\u00a02011.We identified patients who withdrew from dialysis, either as a listed cause of death or censor reason. Incidence rates and subdistribution hazard ratios for withdrawal from dialysis as well as 4 other censoring reasons were examined across age groups. In addition, demographic and clinical characteristics associated with withdrawal from dialysis therapy among patients \u226580\u00a0years old was assessed using logistic regression analysis.Among 17,296 patients aged \u226580 years, 10% of patients withdrew from dialysis. Duration from the last hemodialysis treatment to death was 10 [interquartile range 6-16] days in patients with available data. Withdrawal from dialysis was the second and third most common cause of death among patients aged \u226580 years and <80 years, respectively. Among patients \u226580 years, minorities were much less likely than non-Hispanic whites to stop dialysis. Other factors associated with higher odds of dialysis withdrawal included having a central venous catheter compared to an arteriovenous fistula at dialysis start, dementia, living in mid-west regions, and less favorable markers associated with malnutrition-inflammation-cachexia syndrome such as higher white blood cell counts and lower body mass index, albumin, and normalized protein catabolic rate.Among very-elderly incident hemodialysis patients, dialysis therapy withdrawal exhibits wide variations across age, race and ethnicity, regions, cognitive status, dialysis vascular access, and nutritional status. Further studies examining implications of withdrawal from dialysis in older patients are warranted."

Data were collected from staff at eight hospitals in six states and territories of Australia. Thirty-eight face-to-face interviews were conducted. A modified five-step qualitative content analysis approach was used to analyse the data.Improved visualization technology and its use by interventional radiologists has steered insertions to specialist teams in specialist locations. This is thought to have decreased risk and improved patient outcomes. Nurses were identified as the professional group responsible for maintaining catheter access integrity, preventing access failure and reducing access-related complications. While best practice was considered important, justifications for variations in practice related to local patient and environment challenges were identified.The interdisciplinary team is central in the insertion, maintenance, removal and education of patients regarding dialysis CVCs. Clinicians temper research-based decision-making about central dialysis access catheter management with knowledge of individual, environmental and patient factors. Strategies to ensure guidelines are appropriately translated for use in a wide variety of settings are necessary for patient safety."

The objective of this study was to examine the primary care predictors of unplanned starts to RRT.Retrospective cohort study with linked primary care and hospital data.128 general practices in East London with a combined population of 1 043 346 people.999 consecutive patients starting dialysis at Barts Health National Health Service Trust between September 2014 and August 2017.Unplanned versus a planned start to dialysis among the cohort of 389 patients with a linked primary care record. An unplanned start to dialysis is defined as receiving nephrology care in the low clearance clinic (or equivalent) for less than 90 days. A planned start is defined as access to pre-dialysis counselling and care for at least 90 days prior to commencing dialysis.The adjusted logistic regression analysis showed that the most important modifiable risk factors for unplanned dialysis were the absence of a chronic kidney disease (CKD) code in the general practice (GP) record (OR 8.02, 95%\u2009CI 3.65 to 17.63) and the absence of prescribed lipid lowering medication (OR 2.37, 95%\u2009CI 1.05 to 5.34). Other contributing factors included male gender and a greater number of long-term conditions.Improving CKD coding in primary care and the additional review and clinical scrutiny associated with this may contribute to a further reduction in unplanned RRT rates."

    "title": "Toward an individualized determination of dialysis adequacy: a narrative review with special emphasis on incremental hemodialysis.",
    "content": "The search for the 'perfect' renal replacement therapy has been paralleled by the search for the perfect biomarkers for assessing dialysis adequacy. Three main families of markers have been assessed: small molecules (prototype: urea); middle molecules (prototype \u03b22-microglobulin); comprehensive and nutritional markers (prototype of the simplified assessment, albumin levels; composite indexes as malnutrition-inflammation score). After an era of standardization of dialysis treatment, personalized dialysis schedules are increasingly proposed, challenging the dogma of thrice-weekly hemodialysis.In this review, we describe the advantages and limitations of the approaches mentioned above, focusing on the open questions regarding personalized schedules and incremental hemodialysis.In the era of personalized dialysis, the assessment of dialysis adequacy should be likewise personalized, due to the limits of 'one size fits all' approaches. We have tried to summarize some of the relevant issues regarding the determination of dialysis adequacy, attempting to adapt them to an elderly, highly comorbidity population, which would probably benefit from tailor-made dialysis prescriptions. While no single biomarker allows precisely tailoring the dialysis dose, we suggest using a combination of clinical and biological markers to prescribe dialysis according to comorbidity, life expectancy, residual kidney function, and small and medium-size molecule depuration."

    "title": "Incremental Hemodialysis, Residual Kidney Function, and Mortality Risk in Incident Dialysis Patients: A Cohort Study.",
    "content": "Maintenance hemodialysis is typically prescribed thrice weekly irrespective of a patient's residual kidney function (RKF). We hypothesized that a less frequent schedule at hemodialysis therapy initiation is associated with greater preservation of RKF without compromising survival among patients with substantial RKF.A longitudinal cohort.23,645 patients who initiated maintenance hemodialysis therapy in a large dialysis organization in the United States (January 2007 to December 2010), had available RKF data during the first 91 days (or quarter) of dialysis, and survived the first year.Incremental (routine twice weekly for >6 continuous weeks during the first 91 days upon transition to dialysis) versus conventional (thrice weekly) hemodialysis regimens during the same time.Changes in renal urea clearance and urine volume during 1 year after the first quarter and survival after the first year.Among 23,645 included patients, 51% had substantial renal urea clearance (\u22653.0mL/min/1.73m(2)) at baseline. Compared with 8,068 patients with conventional hemodialysis regimens matched based on baseline renal urea clearance, urine volume, age, sex, diabetes, and central venous catheter use, 351 patients with incremental regimens exhibited 16% (95% CI, 5%-28%) and 15% (95% CI, 2%-30%) more preserved renal urea clearance and urine volume at the second quarter, respectively, which persisted across the following quarters. Incremental regimens showed higher mortality risk in patients with inadequate baseline renal urea clearance (\u22643.0mL/min/1.73m(2); HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.07-2.44), but not in those with higher baseline renal urea clearance (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.76-1.28). Results were similar in a subgroup defined by baseline urine volume of 600mL/d.Potential selection bias and wide CIs.Among incident hemodialysis patients with substantial RKF, incremental hemodialysis may be a safe treatment regimen and is associated with greater preservation of RKF, whereas higher mortality is observed after the first year of dialysis in those with the lowest RKF. Clinical trials are needed to examine the safety and effectiveness of twice-weekly hemodialysis."

    "title": "Soft Target Weight: Theory and Simulation of a Novel Haemodialysis Protocol Which Reduces Excessive Ultrafiltration.",
    "content": "Excessive ultrafiltration is associated with intra-dialytic symptoms, loss of residual function, and mortality in haemodialysis patients. A major contributor to excessive ultrafiltration is within-individual variation in pre-dialysis weight and the concept of achieving a fixed target weight by the end of each dialysis session. Haemodialysis protocols which allow variable post-dialysis weight have not been proposed.Weight variation was observed in haemodialysis patients and healthy controls to estimate the proportion of pre-dialysis weight variation which could be considered natural variation. These estimates were used to derive a novel protocol for setting ultrafiltration, which was evaluated by mathematical modelling.Amongst 20 haemodialysis patients, mean (SD) pre-dialysis weight was 102.74 (0.94)% of target weight after a 2-day gap and 103.50 (0.94)% after a 3-day gap. Amongst 10 healthy individuals, mean (SD) daily weight was 100.0 (0.71)% of average weight. A 4-component model of pre-dialysis weight was derived using these estimates, in which the best estimate of pre-dialysis excess fluid is the midpoint of excess weight and average fluid gain, and used to propose a novel protocol for ultrafiltration setting. In simulations, the novel protocol reduced ultrafiltration variation by more than half (standard deviation 0.6 vs. 1.3% of target weight, p < 0.001), without increasing the variation in post-dialysis fluid excess. Excessive ultrafiltration rates (over 13 mL/h/kg) were far less frequent using this protocol (2.6% vs. 7.5% of sessions, p = 0.001).Considering natural weight variation allows the development of a novel protocol for ultrafiltration in which target weight does not have to be achieved precisely: it is therefore a soft target. This protocol, which is predicted to substantially reduce excessive ultrafiltration variation, is a zero-cost intervention with the potential to improve symptoms and clinical outcome for haemodialysis patients."

    "content": "Although peritoneal dialysis (PD) costs less to the health care system compared to in-center hemodialysis (HD), it is an underused therapy. Neither modality has been consistently shown to confer a clear benefit to patient survival. A key limitation of prior research is that study patients were not restricted to those eligible for both therapies.Retrospective cohort study.All adult patients developing end-stage renal disease from January 2004 to December 2013 at any of 7 regional dialysis centers in Ontario, Canada, who had received at least 1 outpatient dialysis treatment and had\u00a0completed a multidisciplinary modality assessment.HD or PD.Mortality from any cause.Among all incident patients with end-stage renal disease (1,579 HD and 453 PD), PD was associated with lower risk for death among patients younger than 65 years. However, after excluding approximately one-third of all incident patients deemed to be ineligible for PD, the modalities were associated with similar survival regardless of age. This finding was also observed in analyses that were restricted to patients initiating dialysis therapy electively as outpatients. The impact of modality on survival did not vary over time.The determination of PD eligibility was based on the judgment of the multidisciplinary team at each dialysis center.HD and PD are associated with similar mortality among incident dialysis patients who are eligible for both modalities. The effect of modality on survival does not appear to change over time. Future comparisons of dialysis modality should be restricted to individuals who are deemed eligible for both modalities to reflect the outcomes of patients who have the opportunity to choose between HD and PD in clinical practice."

    "content": "Despite growing evidence about the benefits of physical activity and exercise in patients receiving dialysis, physical inactivity is highly prevalent. This may be due to uncertainty and lack of appropriate guidance about exercise, or driven by the relative barriers and benefits that patients perceive. Understanding these perceptions in dialysis patients may inform interventions aimed to increase exercise participation.Perceived benefits and barriers to exercise were measured by the 'Dialysis Patient-perceived Exercise Benefits and Barriers Scale' (DPEBBS). Self-reported physical activity status was assessed by the 'General Practice Physical Activity Questionnaire'. Barriers and benefits to exercise were classed as binary variables (i.e. yes and no). Frequency analyses and chi-squared tests were conducted to compare the differences perceived by people on haemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD). Binominal logistical regression was performed to determine which perceived barriers and benefits had the biggest impact on physical activity status.One thousand twenty-two HD and 124 PD patients completed the DPEBBS. A greater proportion of HD than PD patients reported 'reduces body pain' (P\u2009=\u20090.013), 'delays decline in body function' (P\u2009=\u20090.01), and 'improves quality of life' (P\u2009=\u20090.033) as benefits of exercise. No differences in barriers were observed. Tiredness was the most reported barrier to exercise. Patients who perceived 'other comorbidities' (OR 3.389, P\u2009<\u20090.001) or 'burden of family' (OR 3.168, P\u2009<\u20090.001) as barriers were 3 times more likely to be inactive.Dialysis patients perceive several barriers which may prevent them from engaging in physical activity. Addressing these barriers may be key to increasing participation in physical activity and exercise."

    "content": "Increasing use of peritoneal dialysis (PD) will likely lead to increasing numbers of patients transitioning from PD to hemodialysis (HD). We describe the characteristics of patients who discontinued PD and converted to HD, trajectories of acute-care encounter rates and the total cost of care both before and after PD discontinuation, and the incidence of modality-related outcomes after PD discontinuation.We analyzed data in the United States Renal Data System to identify patients aged \u226512 years who were newly diagnosed with ESKD in 2001-2017, initiated PD during the first year of ESKD, and discontinued PD in 2009-2018. We estimated monthly rates of hospital admissions, observation stays, emergency department encounters, and Medicare Parts A and B costs during the 12 months before and after conversion from PD to HD, and the incidence of home HD initiation, death, and kidney transplantation after conversion to in-facility HD.Among 232,699 patients who initiated PD, there were 124,213 patients who discontinued PD. Among them, 68,743 (55%) converted to HD. In this subgroup, monthly rates of acute-care encounters and total costs of care to Medicare sharply increased during the 6 months preceding PD discontinuation, peaking at 96.2 acute-care encounters per 100 patient-months and $20,701 per patient in the last month of PD. After conversion, rates decreased, but remained higher than before conversion. Among patients who converted to in-facility HD, the cumulative incidence of home HD initiation, death, and kidney transplantation at 24 months was 3%, 25%, and 7%, respectively.The transition from PD to HD is characterized by high rates of acute-care encounters and health-care expenditures. Quality improvement efforts should be aimed at improving transitions and encouraging both home HD and kidney transplantation after PD discontinuation."

    "content": "Post-dialysis fatigue is a common and distressing complaint in patients on hemodialysis (HD). The dialysis recovery time (DRT) is a recent and reliable method of Post-dialysis fatigue assessment. We aimed to identify factors affecting the DRT and its relation with HD patients' quality of life.This is a cross-sectional study carried out on end-stage renal disease patients on regular HD. All participants underwent detailed history taking and complete physical examination, and data on dialysis and laboratory investigations were also collected. Patients were asked \"How long does it take you to recover from a dialysis session?\" to calculate the DRT. We used the Malnutrition-Inflammation Score (MIS) and KDQOL-36 questionnaire to assess patients' nutritional status and quality of life, respectively.Two hundred and ten patients were screened and 191, with a median age of 47\u2009years, completed the study. Patients had a median DRT of 300\u2009minutes (range: 0.0-2880.0), with 55% of patients reporting a DRT of >\u2009240\u2009minutes and 22.5% of them reporting a DRT of <\u200930\u2009minutes. Patients had a median MIS score of 7 (range: 0-17). There was a statistically significant negative relation between the DRT and symptom/ problem list (p\u2009<\u20090.001), effects of kidney disease (p\u2009<\u20090.001), burden of kidney disease (p\u2009<\u20090.001), SF-12 physical composite (p\u2009=\u20090.001), and SF-12 mental composite (p\u2009<\u20090.001) of KDQOL. The results of multivariate analyses showed that dialysate Na (p\u2009=\u20090.003), and the number of missed sessions (p\u2009<\u20090.001) were independently correlated with the DRT.Decreased dialysate Na, and increased number of missed sessions were predictors of prolonged DRT. Patients with prolonged DRT were associated with poorer quality of life. Further randomized clinical trials are needed to assess strategies to minimize the DRT and, perhaps, enhance clinical outcomes.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04727281.

    "content": "The global burden of kidney failure is increasing, but the treatment of kidney failure varies widely between patients, between dialysis facilities and over time. The Alliance for Quality Assessment in Healthcare-Dialysis (AQuAH-D) aims to conduct efficient and timely cohort studies on associations between those variations and clinical and patient-reported outcomes.Included are outpatients aged 20 years old or older who are undergoing haemodialysis and have consented to participate. A total of 2895 patients were enrolled from 25 facilities in Japan between August 2018 and July 2020 and are to be followed until 31 December 2026. Chart review and annual questionnaires are used to collect data on patient characteristics and on outcomes including quality of life. Data on medications, haemodialysis prescriptions and blood tests are obtained from existing electronic records. Data are collected retrospectively from 1 January 2017 to patient enrolment, and prospectively from patient enrolment until the end of December 2026.To date, the mean age is 68.3 (SD 12.2) years and 35.2% are female. The most common cause of kidney failure is diabetic nephropathy (37.4%). In January 2020, the facilities' median weekly doses of erythropoietin stimulating agent (ESA) and of intravenous vitamin D ranged from 1846 to 9692\u2009IU (epoetin alfa equivalent) and 0.78 to 2.25\u2009\u00b5g (calcitriol equivalent), respectively. The facilities' percentages of patients to whom calcimimetics are prescribed varied from 19% to 79%. During the retrospective period (averaging 1.85 years per participant), the incidence rates of any hospitalisation and of hospitalisation due to cardiovascular disease were 67.2 and 12.0 per 100 person-years, respectively.AQuAH-D data will be updated every 6 months and will be available for studies addressing a wide range of research questions, using the advantages of granular data and quality-of-life measurement of ageing patients on haemodialysis."

Dialysis unit attributes and isolation strategies that might reduce dialysis center COVID-19 infection rates have not been previously examined.We explored the role of variables, including community disease burden, dialysis unit attributes (size and layout), and infection control strategies, on rates of COVID-19 among patients receiving in-center hemodialysis in London, United Kingdom, between March 2, 2020 and May 31, 2020. The two outcomes were defined as (<i>1</i>) a positive test for infection or admission with suspected COVID-19 and (<i>2</i>) admission to the hospital with suspected infection. Associations were examined using a discrete time multilevel time-to-event analysis.Data on 5755 patients dialyzing in 51 units were analyzed; 990 (17%) tested positive and 465 (8%) were admitted with suspected COVID-19 between March 2 and May 31, 2020. Outcomes were associated with age, diabetes, local community COVID-19 rates, and dialysis unit size. A greater number of available side rooms and the introduction of mask policies for asymptomatic patients were inversely associated with outcomes. No association was seen with sex, ethnicity, or deprivation indices, nor with any of the different isolation strategies.Rates of COVID-19 in the in-center hemodialysis population relate to individual factors, underlying community transmission, unit size, and layout."

Dialysis is a life-saving therapy but it entails the use of a broad range of consumables generating waste, and consumption of water and energy for the dialysis process. Various stakeholders in the healthcare sector are called upon to develop and to take measures to save resources and to make healthcare and dialysis more sustainable. Among these stakeholders are manufacturers of dialysis equipment and water purification systems. Dialysis equipment and consumables, together with care processes need to be advanced to reduce waste generation, enhance recyclability, optimize water purification efficiency and water use. Joint efforts should thus pave the way to enable delivering green dialysis and to contribute to environmentally sustainable health care."

Fibroblast growth factor 23, soluble alpha klotho, indoxyl sulphate, beta-CrossLaps, and Procollagen 1 N Terminal Propeptide levels were significantly higher in patients of both the hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis groups than in the healthy volunteers' group. There was no difference in levels of these molecules between hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis groups.Fibroblast growth factor 23, sclerostin, indoxyl sulphate, beta-CrossLaps, and Paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain levels were higher in patients of both groups as inflammatory markers. In our study, we found higher soluble alpha klotho levels in patients of both groups than in the healthy volunteers' group, suggesting that blood soluble alpha klotho levels may not correlate with renal klotho levels."

Population PK analysis with Monte Carlo simulations for different dosing regimens was performed. For minimum inhibitory concentration 2\u00a0mg/L was chosen. The target was set as 50% time \u22654\u00d7 minimum inhibitory concentration.The PK of meropenem was best described by a 1-compartment model with linear elimination. Serum creatinine, residual diuresis and time on RRT, with no difference between sustained low-efficiency dialysis and continuous veno-venous haemodialysis, were found to be significant covariates affecting clearance, explaining >20% of the clearance between subject variability. PTA analysis showed that in patients with RRT, 2\u00a0g/24\u2009h, meropenem CI achieved a PTA of 95%. In patients without RRT, the target was achieved with 3\u00a0g/24\u2009h CI or prolonged infusion of 1\u00a0g meropenem over 8\u00a0hours but not with bolus application of 1\u00a0g meropenem for 8\u00a0hours. Only 2 patients (both without RRT) had meropenem concentrations below the target level. However, approximately half of the patients with RRT receiving CI 3\u00a0g/24\u2009h meropenem had toxic concentrations.We found relevant PK variability for meropenem CI in septic patients with or without RRT, leading to a substantial risk for overdosing in patients with RRT. This finding highlights the strong demand for personalized dosing in critically ill patients."

We aimed to determine the association of RRF, urine output and haemodialysis itself on cardiac biomarkers in haemodialysis patients.Adult haemodialysis patients underwent venesection pre- and post-haemodialysis then echocardiography and inter-dialytic urine collection to calculate RRF (mL/min per 1.73m<sup>2</sup> ) and urine output (mL/day). Galectin-3, BNP-32, NT-ProBNP and hs-TnT levels were compared across tertiles of echocardiographic parameters, RRF and urine output using the non-parametric test for trend across ordered groups.Twenty-three patients (17 male) with mean age 67.7\u00b113.8\u2009years and median (interquartile range) dialysis duration 13.6 (9.8-19.1) months participated. Galectin-3 was substantially lower following haemodialysis: 55\u2009ng/mL (47-70) versus 23\u2009ng/mL (19-27, P\u2009<\u20090.001), but other biomarkers changed little. By increasing RRF tertile, post-dialysis galectin-3 was 32.6\u2009ng/mL (23.7-36.6), 21.9\u2009ng/mL (19.0-23.2) and 19.0\u2009ng/mL (16.9-21.0, P\u2009=\u20090.001); NT-ProBNP was 10\u2009192\u2009ng/L (2303-21\u2009504), 2037\u2009ng/L (1224-10\u2009795) and 1481\u2009ng/L (172-2890, P\u2009=\u20090.016). Results were similar for daily urine volume, but measured echocardiographic parameters were not associated with biomarker concentrations.Plasma concentration of galectin-3 is reduced by the haemodialysis procedure. Lower RRF and urine volume are strongly associated with higher levels of galectin-3 and NT-Pro-BNP. These associations are important to the clinical interpretation of these biomarker levels in haemodialysis patients."

    "content": "Impaired cognitive functioning in patients with end-stage renal disease may reduce their capabilities to adhere to complex medical or dietary regimens and to fully participate in medical decisions. With decreasing renal function, cognitive abilities are likely to decline, with cognitive dysfunction improving after initiation of dialysis and even being generally reversible after successful renal transplantation. However, little is known about cognitive changes particularly regarding different treatment modalities. To gain further insight into this, we focused on a one-year course of cognitive functions, comparing peritoneal to hemodialysis patients. Within the CORETH-project, two validated neurocognitive tests, assessing executive functioning (Trail Making Test-B) and attention (d2-Revision-Test) and the self-reported Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form Cognitive Function-subscale, were administered to 271 patients at baseline and after one year. Subsamples were matched by propensity score, adjusting for age, comorbidity, education, and employment status for 96 hemodialysis and 101 peritoneal dialysis patients. The effects of time and treatment modality were investigated, controlling for well-known confounders. Both tests revealed improvement over one year. Peritoneal dialysis was associated with better outcomes than hemodialysis at baseline and follow-up, but comparability between groups may be limited. The opposite pattern applied to self-reporting. Hemodialysis patients had to be excluded from cognitive testing more often than peritoneal dialysis patients. As such, the number of exclusions may have biased the findings, limiting generalizability. Thus, our findings suggest an improvement of cognitive functioning and support previous indications for peritoneal dialysis being associated with better cognitive functions during a one-year course than hemodialysis."

    "content": "Hemodialysis (HD) involves purifying the blood of waste products through diffusion through a semipermeable membrane. We aimed to evaluate dialysis practice patterns among children with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on maintenance HD (MHD). This cross-sectional study was conducted on 30 children with ESRD on MHD at the pediatric nephrology unit of Menoufia University and 18 age- and sex-matched children who served as the control group. Consent was obtained from children more than seven years old and their parents and from parents of younger children. They were all subjected to full history, complete physical examination, efficiency measures estimation (for cases), and laboratory investigations. Risk factors for death were determined using the logistic regression model; data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software. The study showed that the causes of ESRD in children were unknown in 43.3%; about 73.3% of cases were short-statured and 53.3% were underweight. About 40% of the cases were hypertensive showing a significant difference from controls (P <0.01). A double-lumen jugular catheter (DLJC) was the initial access in 80% of cases. The urea reduction ratio and Kt/V were significantly higher in children with arteriovenous fistula (AVF) than those with DLJC (P <0.0001 and 0.004), respectively. About 66.7% of cases had anemia showing a significant difference from controls (P <0.01). Hypoalbuminemia, anemia, elevated C-reactive protein, and left ventricular hypertrophy were the significant risk factors resulting in death (P <0.0001). Although the most common initiating vascular access used for HD patients was a DLJC, the efficiency of dialysis was significantly higher in patients who had AVF. Stature was affected more than weight in HD patients in the study group."

The pathological mechanisms associated with kidney injury in canine leishmaniosis include immune complex glomerulonephritis, tubulointerstitial nephritis and occasionally renal amyloidosis. Proteinuria is a frequent finding in canine leishmaniosis and its quantification by the urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPC) is an important parameter in the staging of canine lesihmaniosis as presented by the LeishVet group.A 4.5 year-old spayed female Belgian Malinois dog was presented to the Hebrew University Veterinary Teaching hospital with epistaxis and rhinitis and diagnosed also with proteinuria and acute kidney injury (AKI IRIS grade V) associated with canine leishmaniosis that developed to LeishVet stage III with chronic kidney disease (CKD) after stabilization. Clinicopathologic abnormalities included azotemia with a peak creatinine concentration of 7.76 mg/dl (reference interval, 0.3-1.2 ng/dl), hypoalbuminemia (1.76 g/dl, reference interval 3-4.4 g/dl), hyperglobulinemia (4.54 g/dl, reference interval 1.8-3.9 g/dl) and proteinuria (urine protein/creatinine ratio 15.6, normal < 0.2). Serology by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for Leishmania infantum was positive with high antibody levels. The dog was hospitalized and treated with intermittent hemodialysis, feeding through an esophageal feeding tube, medical treatment for protein losing nephropathy and antileishmanial treatment with allopurinol. Kidney function gradually improved and the dog's creatinine levels and proteinuria decreased until complete normalization two years after the acute insult. However, rhinitis and sneezing persisted and although the anti-leishmanial antibodies decreased over time, the dog remains constantly seropositive.To our knowledge, this is the first report of hemodialysis management of AKI associated with canine leishmaniosis. Hemodialysis was imperative in stabilizing the dog's renal disease and controlling its azotemia. It demostrates that hemodialysis can be beneficial in the management of acute deterioration of kidney disease in canine leishmaniosis."

    "content": "Cirrhotic patients often develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring renal replacement therapy in the form of hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD). Studies comparing the outcomes and difference in in-hospital mortality between these 2 groups, particularly among those with ascites, are sparse. We set our objective to determine the dialysis modality with a better in-hospital survival rate among cirrhotic patients with ESRD (ESRD-cirrhosis).Data was extracted from the 2005 to 2012 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS). Using propensity score matching, ESRD-cirrhosis patients on PD were matched with patients on HD at a 1:1 ratio. Another subgroup analysis of ESRD-cirrhosis patients with ascites was performed using the same matching algorithm. Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).Among 26,135 cirrhotic patients with incident ESRD, 25,686 (98.3%) and 449 (1.7%) were initiated on HD and PD, respectively, during the hospitalization. There was a nonsignificant mortality difference between the ESRD-cirrhosis patients treated with PD and those treated with HD. In a subgroup analysis of these patients with ascites, 18 patients underwent PD while 1,878 patients required HD. Also, PD had a significantly lower in-hospital mortality compared with HD in this subgroup (0% vs 26.67%, <i>p</i> = 0.03). Mean length of stay for those who received HD was 8.34 days compared with 7.06 days for the PD group (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). Similarly, mean hospital charges were greater for those who had HD compared with PD ($74,501 vs $57,460; <i>p</i> < 0.001).Cirrhotic patients with ESRD and ascites who undergo PD have a significantly lower mortality than those who are started on HD. However PD is rarely initiated for ESRD in cirrhotic patients with ascites during hospitalization in the United States. Due to the potential advantages of PD, nephrologists should encourage PD when selecting dialysis modality in this subgroup of patients whenever possible."

    "title": "Patient Survival Between Hemodialysis and Peritoneal Dialysis Among End-Stage Renal Disease Patients Secondary to Myeloperoxidase-ANCA-Associated Vasculitis.",
    "content": "A significant proportion of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) associated glomerulonephritis eventually progresses to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) thus requiring long-term dialysis. There is no consensus about which dialysis modality is more recommended for those patients with associated vasculitis (AAV-ESRD). The primary objective of this study was to compare patient survival in patients with AAV-ESRD treated with hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD).This double-center retrospective cohort study included dialysis-dependent patients who were treated with HD or PD. Clinical data were collected under standard format. The Birmingham vasculitis activity score (BVAS) was used to evaluate disease activity at diagnosis and organ damage was assessed using the vasculitis damage index (VDI) at dialysis initiation.In total, 85 patients were included: 64 with hemodialysis and 21 with peritoneal dialysis. The patients with AAV-PD were much younger than the AAV-HD patients (48 vs. 62, <i>P</i> < 0.01) and more were female (76.2 vs. 51.6%, <i>P</i> = 0.05). The laboratory data were almost similar. The comorbidities, VDI score, and immuno-suppressive therapy at dialysis initiation were almost no statistical difference. Patient survival rates between HD and PD at 1 year were 65.3 vs. 90% (<i>P</i> = 0.062), 3 year were 59.6 vs. 90% (<i>P</i> < 0.001), and 5 years were 59.6 vs. 67.5% (<i>P</i> = 0.569). The overall survival was no significant difference between the two groups (<i>P</i> = 0.086) and the dialysis modality (HD or PD) was not shown to be an independent predictor for all-cause death (hazard ratio (HR) 0.73; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31-1.7; <i>P</i> = 0.473). Cardio-cerebrovascular events were the main cause of death among AAV-HD patients while infection in patients with AAV-PD.These results provide real-world data that the use of either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis modality does not affect patient survival for patients with AAV-ESRD who need long-term dialysis."

    "content": "End-stage renal disease (ESRD) leads to renal replacement therapy and certainly has an impact on patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This study aimed to review and compare the HRQoL between peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) patients using the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), EuroQoL-5-dimension (EQ-5D) and the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Instrument (KDQOL).Systematic review was conducted by identify relevant studies through MEDLINE and SCOPUS up to April 2017. Studies were eligible with following criteria: studied in ESRD patients, compare any pair of renal replacement modalities, and reported HRQoL. The unstandardized mean differences (USMD) of HRQoL among modalities were calculated and pooled using a random-effect models if heterogeneity was present, otherwise a fixed-effect model was applied.A total of twenty-one studies were included with 29,000 participants. Of them, mean age and percent male were 48.1\u2009years and 45.1, respectively. The pooled USMD (95% CI) of SF-36 between PD and HD (base) were 1.86 (0.47, 3.24) and 0.42 (-\u20091.99, 2.82) for mental component and physical component summary scores, respectively. For EQ-5D, the pooled USMD of utility and visual analogue scale (VAS) score were 0.02 (-\u20090.06, 0.10) and 3.56 (1.73, 5.39), respectively. The pooled USMD of KDQOL were 9.67 (5.67, 13.68), 6.71 (-\u20095.92, 19.32) 6.30 (-\u20090.41, 12.18), 2.35 (-\u20094.35, 9.04), 2.10 (0.07, 4.13), and 1.21 (-\u20092.98, 5.40) for burden of kidney disease, work status, effects of kidney disease, quality of social interaction, symptoms, and cognitive function.Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5 or ESRD treated with PD had better generic HRQoL measured by SF-36 and EQ-5D than HD patients. In addition, PD had higher specific HRQoL by KDQOL than HD patients in subdomain of physical functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, effects and burden of kidney disease."

Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and outcomes of the patients were reviewed. Data was analysed using SPSS 21.Of 437 patients on haemodialysis, 46(10.5%) contracted coronavirus disease-2019; 29(63%) males and 17(37%) females. The overall median age was 61.5\u00b113.02 years. Most patients developed mild disease 27(%). The most common symptom was fever 29(63%), and 6(13.1%) patients had patchy bilateral opacity on chest radiograph. Major complications were lymphocytopenia 29(63%), pneumonia 15(32.6%), thrombocytopenia 8(17.4%), and septic shock 5(10.9%). Overall, 15(32.6%) patients required hospitalisation, and 8(17.4%) required mechanical ventilation. There were 13(28.3%) deaths. Patients aged >60 years had 6.8 times more severe disease (p=0.023) and chances of death among them were 5.8 times higher (p=0.036) than in those aged <60 years.There was a high susceptibility of haemodialysis patients during the second wave of coronavirus disease compared to the general population. The most important determinants of death were advanced age, lower oxygen saturation and thrombocytopenia at presentation."

    "content": "L-carnitine is an important factor in fatty acid metabolism, and carnitine deficiency is common in dialysis patients. This study evaluated whether L-carnitine supplementation improved muscle spasm, cardiac function, and renal anemia in dialysis patients. Eighty Japanese outpatients (62 hemodialysis (HD) patients and 18 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients) received oral L-carnitine (600 mg/day) for 12 months; the HD patients further received intravenous L-carnitine injections (1000 mg three times/week) for 12 months, amounting to 24 months of treatment. Muscle spasm incidence was assessed using a questionnaire, and cardiac function was assessed using echocardiography. Baseline free carnitine concentrations were relatively low in patients who underwent dialysis for >4 years. Total carnitine serum concentration, free carnitine, and acylcarnitine significantly increased after oral L-carnitine treatment for 12 months, and after intravenous L-carnitine injection. There was no significant improvement in muscle spasms, although decreased muscle cramping after L-carnitine treatment was reported by 31% of patients who had undergone HD for >4 years. Hemoglobin concentrations increased significantly at 12 and 24 months in the HD group. Therefore, L-carnitine may be effective for reducing muscle cramping and improving hemoglobin levels in dialysis patients, especially those who have been undergoing dialysis for >4 years."

    "title": "Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System Blockades Does Not Protect Residual Renal Function in Patients with Hemodialysis at 1 Year After Dialysis Initiation: A Prospective Observational Cohort Study.",
    "content": "The beneficial effects of renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade on residual renal function (RRF) in patients who have just initiated hemodialysis (HD) have been inconclusive. In this study, 935 patients with incident HD from a nationwide prospective observational cohort in Korea were included for analysis. The primary outcome showed that RRF as demonstrated by urine volume changes over 0, 3, and 12 months differed between the RAAS blockade and control groups. Mixed-effects linear regression was used to compare RRF between the groups. Patients in the RAAS group had a greater proportion of higher urine volume at study enrollment compared to the control group, but there was no difference in baseline characteristics, heart function, and dialysis-related indices. After adjusting for confounding factors, the RAAS group did not provide a significant benefit to RRF in a mixed-effects linear regression (p\u2009=\u20090.51). Male gender, high Charlson comorbidity index, diuretic use, and high weekly ultrafiltration volume were associated with faster decline in RRF. The RAAS group failed to provide a protective effect for the development of anuria 1 year after initiating dialysis based on the multivariate logistic regression (OR 0.73 95% CI 0.25-2.13, p\u2009=\u20090.57). In Korean patients with incident HD, RAAS blockade did not provide a protective effect for RRF after 1 year. Further research is needed to clarify the optimal treatment for preserving RRF in HD patients."

    "content": "Comparisons of survival between dialysis modalities is of great importance to patients with kidney failure, their families, and healthcare systems.This study's objective was to compare mortality of patients on chronic hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) and identify variables associated with mortality.This retrospective cohort study included adult incident patients with kidney failure treated with HD or PD by the Baxter Renal Care Services network in Colombia. The study was conducted between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2013 (recruitment period), with follow-up until December 31, 2018. The outcome was the cumulative mortality rate at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years. Propensity score matching (PSM) and the Gompertz parametric survival model were used to compare mortality in HD versus PD.The analysis included 12,499 patients, of whom 57.4% were on PD at inception. The overall mortality rate was 14.0 events per 100 patient-years (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.61-14.42). Using an intention-to-treat approach, crude mortality rates were significantly lower in patients receiving HD (HD: 12.3 deaths per 100 patient-years [95% CI, 11.7-12.8] vs. PD: 15.5 [14.9-16.1], p < 0.01). Using a Gompertz parametric survival model, dialysis modality was not significantly associated with mortality (hazard ratio HD vs. PD 1.0, 95% CI, 0.9-1.1). After PSM, the mortality cumulative incidence functions between HD and PD were not statistically significantly different (p = 0.88).The present study in a large cohort of incident dialysis patients with at least 5 years follow-up and using PSM methods showed no differences in cumulative mortality between HD and PD patients. This evidence from a middle-income country may facilitate the process of dialysis modality selection globally."

    "content": "It is unclear if haemodiafiltration improves patient survival compared with standard haemodialysis. Observational studies have tended to show benefit with haemodiafiltration, while meta-analyses have not provided definitive proof of superiority.Using data from the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry, this binational inception cohort study compared all adult patients who commenced haemodialysis in Australia and New Zealand between 2000 and 2014. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Cardiovascular mortality was the secondary outcome. Outcomes were measured from the first haemodialysis treatment and were examined using multivariable Cox regression analyses. Patients were censored at permanent discontinuation of haemodialysis or at 31 December 2014. Analyses were stratified by country.The study included 26\u2009961 patients (4110 haemodiafiltration, 22\u2009851 standard haemodialysis; 22\u2009774 Australia, 4187 New Zealand) with a median follow-up of 5.31 (interquartile range 2.87-8.36) years. Median age was 62\u2009years, 61% were male, 71% were Caucasian. Compared with standard haemodialysis, haemodiafiltration was associated with a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for Australia 0.79, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.72-0.87; adjusted HR for New Zealand 0.88, 95% CI 0.78-1.00]. In Australian patients, there was also an association between haemodiafiltration and reduced cardiovascular mortality (adjusted HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64-0.95).Haemodiafiltration was associated with superior survival across patient subgroups of age, sex and comorbidity."

    "content": "Switch from hemodialysis (HD) to peritoneal dialysis (PD) is unfrequent, but incentive strategies to perform PD can lead to an increase of these transitions. However, data on transitioning from HD to PD are scarce. We hypothesized that time spent on HD before transfer to PD would impact PD outcomes.This registry-based, nationwide study analyzed patients transferred from HD to PD. Patients who began HD between January 2008 and December 2016 were included. Cox and Fine and Gray regression models were used to explore the relationship between time spent on HD before PD and outcomes in PD: PD cessation for death or retransfer to HD (composite endpoint); for death; and for retransfer to HD.Over the study period, 1,985 of the 77,587 HD starters (3%) were transferred to PD. The median time spent on HD before transfer to PD was 1.94 months (interquartile range [IQR] 1.02-4.01). The median survival time on PD after this transition was 20 months (IQR 18-21). Time spent on HD before PD was associated with increased risk of death or retransfer to HD (cause-specific hazard ratio [cs-HR] 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1-1.02 for a 1-month increase) and death (cs-HR 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.03) but not with retransfer to HD censored on death (cs-HR 1.00, 95% CI: 0.99-1.01). The results were similar when considering competing events.Switch from HD to PD is rare in France. Time spent on HD before transfer is associated with patient survival but not with retransfer to HD."

We evaluated gastrointestinal lesions of kidney transplant candidates on dialysis.In this study, endoscopic and pathological findings in hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients with gastrointestinal symptoms on the waiting list were compared.The most common non-ulcerous lesions in the endoscopic examination were gastritis (62.3%), erosive gastritis (38.7%), duodenal erosion or duodenitis (18.9%) and esophagitis (13.2%). The ulcerous lesion was present in only 3 patients. Gastroesophageal reflux disease, ulcerated lesion and non-ulcerated lesion rates were similar in both dialysis groups. Histopathological examination revealed Helicobacter pylori (HP) positivity in 28.3% of patients. HP positivity rate was significantly higher in PD patients than in HD patients (38.7% vs. 13.6%, p\u2009=\u20090.046). Chronic gastritis (75.5%) was the most common pathological finding. HP positivity rate was 37.5% in patients with chronic gastritis, but HP was negative in patients without chronic gastritis. In multivariate analysis, male gender, urea and albumin levels were associated with the presence of pathological chronic gastritis. The presence of gastritis, total cholesterol and ferritin levels were found significant for HP positivity. A total cholesterol >\u2009243\u2009mg/dL was significantly related to an increased risk of the presence of HP positivity.Gastrointestinal lesions and HP infection are common in dialysis patients. Dialysis modality may affect the frequency of some lesions. It may be useful to have an endoscopic examination before entering the transplant waiting list for all candidates."

Patients' interest and perceived capability of participation were assessed by a 10-item Likert-type scale developed and tested for this study, with responses ranging from 1 (not interested/no perceived capability) to 5 (already doing task independently). Multivariate linear regression was used to assess the relationship between patient characteristics, including age, sex, education level and severity of illness to ratings of activation level and haemodialysis self-care scale scores. The STROBE checklist was used as a guideline for this study.Ninety-one patients and 31 nurses participated. Overall, patients expressed interest (2.43\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.93) and perceived themselves capable (2.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9) of participating in various haemodialysis-related tasks.

Both greater interest and perceived capability were correlated with more years of education and higher patient activation; additionally, interest was associated with disease severity and perceived capability was associated with age.Haemodialysis patients are interested and perceive themselves capable of participating in the tasks involved in dialysis care. Nurses underestimate patient interest in participation.Self-care behaviours among haemodialysis patients are important, as they may affect quality of life and survival. Determining interest and perceived capability of participation is a first step towards evaluating the feasibility of self-care in a supervised haemodialysis setting."

The aim of this study was to evaluate if functional impairment represents a risk factor for reduced survival in patients on chronic hemodialysis.All incident chronic hemodialysis patients of Lazio, a large region of central Italy, registered in the Dialysis and Transplant Lazio Region Registry (DTLRR) in the period 2008-2013 were considered eligible. Inclusion criteria were: age\u2009>\u200918 years, resident in Lazio, still doing dialysis after 90\u00a0days from incidence date, doing hemodialysis or hemodiafiltration treatment for >\u20099\u00a0h/week. Patients were stratified into three classes of functional activity: total autonomy, autonomy in some activities, and not self-sufficient. Functional activity was assessed for each patient by the referring physician for the DTLRR from the ~\u200990 hemodialysis units of the Lazio region. Each patient was followed from date of first dialysis treatment to the end of the study (31/12/2015) or death or renal transplant, whichever occurred first. Cox proportional hazard models were performed to obtain mortality hazard ratios (HR), 95% confidence intervals (CI), for each class of functional activity adjusting for sex, age, country of birth, city of residence, body mass index (BMI), type of nephropathy, vascular access, previous nephrology counselling, weekly hours of hemodialysis, serum albumin, hemoglobin, and presence of comorbidities (e.g. vascular diseases, coronary disease, and diabetes).A total of 3356 patients were studied. In the whole follow-up period, 1622 deaths occurred (48%). Functional impairment was associated with the risk of mortality: compared to 'total autonomy', the HR for 'autonomy in some activities' was 1.30 [95% CI: 1.14-1.49] and for 'not self-sufficient' 1.71 [1.47-1.99] (p for trend\u2009<\u20090.05). The number of evitable deaths attributable to reduced functional activity was 237.Functional impairment represents a risk factor for reduced survival in chronic hemodialysis patients. There is a need for early identification of patients who might benefit from interventions aimed at preventing, reversing or delaying the functional impairment."

    "title": "Estimation of residual renal function using beta-trace protein: Impact of dialysis procedures.",
    "content": "Beta-trace protein (BTP), a low molecular weight protein of 23-29\u00a0kDa, has been proposed as a promising biomarker to estimate residual renal function (RRF) in patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD). Indeed, BTP is cleared by native kidney but not during conventional HD session. By contrast, the removal rate of BTP using convective processes (mainly hemodiafiltration [HDF]) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) has been little or not investigated. Therefore, an aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of dialysis procedures (high-flux HD, on-line post-dilution HDF and PD) on BTP removal in comparison with beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) and cystatin C (CYSC) removals after a single session. In addition, the ability of BTP to predict RRF in PD was assessed. This observational cross-sectional study included a total of 82 stable chronic kidney disease patients, 53 patients were on maintenance dialysis (with n\u00a0=\u00a026 in HD and n\u00a0=\u00a027 in HDF) and 29 were on PD. Serum concentrations of BTP, B2M, and CYSC were measured (a) before and after a single dialysis session in HD and HDF anuric patients to calculate reduction percentages, (b) in serum, 24-hour-dialysate and 24-hour-urine in PD patients to compute total, peritoneal, and urinary clearance. RRF was estimated using four equations developed for dialysis patients without urine collection and compared to the mean of the urea and creatinine clearances in PD. The concentrations of the three studied molecules were significantly reduced (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) after dialysis session with significantly higher reduction ratio using HDF compared to HD modality (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001): BTP 49.3% vs 17.5%; B2M 82.3% vs 69.7%; CYSC 77.4% vs 66% in HDF and HD, respectively. In non-anuric PD patients, B2M and CYSC were partly removed by peritoneal clearance (72.3% and 57.6% for B2M and CYSC, respectively). By contrast, BTP removal by the peritoneum was negligible and a low bias for the BTP-based equation to estimate RRF (-1.4\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0m<sup>2</sup> ) was calculated. BTP is significantly removed by high-flux HD or HDF, thereby compromising its use to estimate RRF. By contrast, BTP appears as a promising biomarker to estimate RRF in PD patients since it is not affected by peritoneal clearance, unlike B2M and CYSC, and it is well correlated to RRF."

We evaluated some demographic and clinical characteristics as well as compared the mortality rate between men and women with end-stage renal disease on haemodialysis (HD), to find out if gender has any influence on mortality.This was a single centre retrospective study. All adult incident and prevalent haemodialysis patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) seen between July 2007 and June 2019 were enrolled in the study. Data collected included age, sex, hepatitis B and C viral status, vascular access at the commencement of haemodialysis, duration on haemodialysis, number of dialysis sessions ever conducted and outcome of haemodialysis. The outcome was stratified as alive, dead, or lost to follow up. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality. The IBM SPSS Statistical software version 23 was used to analyse the data. Kaplan Meier survival curve was used to compare all-cause mortality between men and women.This study included 995 HD patients of whom 704 (70.8%) were males. Mean age was 44.7 + 16.3 years. At the end of the study period, 878 (88.2%) patients died.

Hepatitis B seropositivity was significantly associated with increased mortality (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 1.2; 95% CI 1.025 - 1.526).Despite the perceived poor access to modern healthcare services by women in Northern Nigeria, there is no gender disparity in crude mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease on haemodialysis."

    "content": "Mobile health is the health care use of mobile devices, such as smartphones. Mobile health readiness is a prerequisite to successful implementation of mobile health programs. The aim of this study was to examine the status and correlates of mobile health readiness among individuals on dialysis.A cross-sectional 30-item questionnaire guided by the Khatun mobile health readiness conceptual model was distributed to individuals on dialysis from 21 in-center hemodialysis facilities and 14 home dialysis centers. The survey assessed the availability of devices and the internet, proficiency, and interest in using mobile health.In total, 949 patients (632 hemodialysis and 317 home dialysis) completed the survey. Of those, 81% owned smartphones or other internet-capable devices, and 72% reported using the internet. The majority (70%) reported intermediate or advanced mobile health proficiency. The main reasons for using mobile health were appointments (56%), communication with health care personnel (56%), and laboratory results (55%). The main reported concerns with mobile health were privacy and security (18%). Mobile health proficiency was lower in older patients: compared with the 45- to 60-years group, respondents in age groups <45, 61-70, and >70 years had adjusted odds ratios of 5.04 (95% confidence interval, 2.23 to 11.38), 0.39 (95% confidence interval, 0.24 to 0.62), and 0.22 (95% confidence interval, 0.14 to 0.35), respectively. Proficiency was lower in participants with Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity (adjusted odds ratio, 0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.31 to 0.75) and with less than college education (adjusted odds ratio for \"below high school,\" 0.09; 95% confidence interval, 0.05 to 0.16 and adjusted odds ratio for \"high school only,\" 0.26; 95% confidence interval, 0.18 to 0.39). Employment was associated with higher proficiency (adjusted odds ratio, 2.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.18 to 4.32). Although home dialysis was associated with higher proficiency in the unadjusted analyses, we did not observe this association after adjustment for other factors.The majority of patients on dialysis surveyed were ready for, and proficient in, mobile health.

    "content": "This systematic review aimed to investigate whether non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT) can reduce systemic inflammatory levels and improve metabolism in patients undergoing haemodialysis (HD) and/or peritoneal dialysis (PD).Electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CNKI, and WFPD) were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) performed through July 2019. The risk of bias within studies was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's risk assessment tool. The systemic inflammatory and metabolic outcomes included the highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), the albumin (Alb), and lipid metabolite levels. Meta-analyses (MAs) were performed to calculate the overall effect size where appropriate.Five RCTs were included in this study. Compared with untreated periodontitis groups, the dialysis patients after NSPT significantly showed decreased hs-CRP levels at less than or equal to 2\u2009months (standardized mean difference: -\u20091.53, 95% confidence interval\u2009-\u20092.95 to -\u20090.11). No significant difference was found in IL-6 and Alb levels following NSPT at either the 3- or 6- month follow-ups. No MAs could be performed on the TNF-a level and the lipid metabolic markers.NSPT can moderately reduce serum hs-CRP levels in HD and/or PD patients, but did not significantly change IL-6 or Alb levels. For TNF-a and lipid metabolism markers, no sufficient evidence supports that these levels are changed after NSPT. Additional scientific research is necessary to assess the effects of NSPT on systemic inflammation and metabolic parameters in dialysis patients."

    "content": "COVID-19 is a very high transmission disease with a variable prognosis in the general population. Patients in hemodialysis therapy are particularly vulnerable to developing an infectious disease, but the incidence and prognosis of hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 is still unclear. The main objective is to describe the experience of our dialysis unit in preventing and controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Preventive structural and organizational changes were applied to all patients and health care personnel in order to limit the risk of local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection.The Nephrology department at Sant Joan Desp\u00ed Moises Broggi Hospital-Consorci Sanitari Integral is a reference for two satellite hemodialysis centers caring for 156 patients. We combine our own hemodialysis maintenance program for 87 patients with hospitalized patients from peripheral hemodialysis centers. In this area, the reported incident rate of COVID-19 in these peripherical hemodialysis centers was 9.5% to 19.9% and the death rate 25% to 30.5%. In our hemodialysis program, the incidence rate was 5.7%. Three out of five required hospitalization (60%) and nobody died.Although the risk of local transmission of the disease was very high due to the increase in hemodialysis patients from peripheral centers admitted to hospital, the incidence rate of COVID-19 was very low in our own hemodialysis patients. We believe that the structural and organizational changes adopted early on and the diagnosis algorithm played an important role in minimizing the spread of the disease."

    "content": "Monitoring of arteriovenous (AV) fistula to detect hemodynamically important stenosis is crucial for the prevention of AV fistula thrombosis. The aim of our study was to analyze the importance of dialysis dose (Kt/V) during online postdilution hemodiafiltration (HDF) for early detection of AV fistula stenosis.Hemodialysis patients with AV fistula were included in this study. We compared a group of 44 patients who have undergone fistulography and subsequently percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of significant AV fistula stenosis (active group) with a group of 44 age- and sex-matched patients without PTA (control group). Observational time in both groups was the same.All patients had postdilution online HDF using a F5008 dialysis machine, which can measure online single-pool Kt/V. All data were analyzed during the performance of 2056 HDF procedures. In the active group, we found statistically significantly lower values of Kt/V, all 8 weeks before PTA. In the active group, there was a significant improvement in Kt/V in the first (p < 0.001) and second week (p = 0.049) after PTA. Three and 8 weeks after PTA, we did not find any statistically significant difference in Kt/V between both groups (p = 0.114; p = 0.058). Patients in the active group had statistically significantly lower substitution volumes and blood pump flow rates during HDF over the whole observation period before and after PTA. In contrast, there were no differences in venous pressure in the dialysis circuit between both groups throughout the observation period.In hemodialysis patients with AV fistula, treated with online HDF, routine measurements of Kt/V during each HDF are a beneficial, quick, and straightforward method for early detection of hemodynamically significant AV fistula stenosis."

    "content": "This study aimed to determine which BP measurement obtained in the HD unit correlated best with home BP and ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM). We retrospectively analyzed data from 40 patients that received maintenance HD who had available home BP and ABPM data. Dialysis unit BPs were the averages of pre-, 2hr- (2\u2009h after starting HD), and post-HD BP during a 9-month study. Home BP was defined as the average of morning and evening home BPs. Dialysis unit BP and home BP were compared over the 9-month study period. ABPM was performed once for 24\u2009h in the absence of dialysis during the final 2\u2009weeks of the study period and was compared to the 2-week dialysis unit BP and home BP. There was a significant difference between dialysis unit systolic blood pressure (SBP) and home SBP over the 9-month period. No significant difference was observed between the 2hr-HD SBP and home SBP. When analyzing 2\u2009weeks of dialysis unit BP and home BP, including ABPM, SBPs were significantly different (dialysis unit BP > home BP > ABPM; P\u00a0=\u00a00.009). Consistent with the 9-month study period, no significant difference was observed between 2hr-HD SBP and home SBP (P\u00a0=\u00a00.809). The difference between 2hr-HD SBP and ambulatory SBP was not significant (P\u00a0=\u00a00.113). In conclusion, the 2hr-HD SBP might be useful for predicting home BP and ABPM in HD patients."

    "title": "Pre-dialysis levels of inflammation and\u00a0endotoxin in people receiving hemodialysis are not associated with\u00a0blood pressure variability.",
    "content": "There are multiple risk factors for inflammation in dialysis. One potential cause is the presence of circulating levels of Gram-negative bacteria-derived endotoxin which is a strong inducer of inflammation. Gut-associated endotoxin may enter the circulation via a defective blood-gut barrier during episodes of hypotension or reduced perfusion.In this study, 165 patients receiving outpatient-based hemodialysis in a facility (FHD) or at home (HHD), were studied. Levels of inflammation were quantified by developing an inflammatory score derived from the measurement of pro-inflammatory cytokines, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Intradialytic blood pressure (BP) variability and hypotension events were recorded. This included the final session of dialysis, at the commencement of which the blood samples were drawn, as well as the five preceding sessions.The median inflammatory score was 2 (range 0 - 3), and 30% of patients had an inflammatory score of three suggesting significant levels of inflammation. Only 8.5% had an inflammatory score of 0. Endotoxin was measured in all participants and was only positive in N = 3. The mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 134 \u00b1 20 mmHg and the BP variability was 11.7 \u00b1 3.5. In a multivariable ordinal regression model, a higher inflammatory score was significantly associated with younger age (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.95 - 0.99, p = 0.03), higher ultrafiltration volume (OR 1.62, CI 1.04 - 2.54, p = 0.03) and lower body mass index (OR 0.9, CI 0.86 - 0.96, p = 0.01). There was no association between inflammatory score and dialysis modality, access type, kidney replacement therapy (KRT), BP variability, or endotoxin. Endotoxin was detected in only 3 of 165 patients and was not associated with inflammation.Pre-dialysis levels of inflammation are prevalent in the hemodialysis population after the long break but are not related to intradialytic BP variability or hypotension in the preceding 2 weeks. However, endotoxemia is uncommon and unlikely to be a significant driver of inflammation."

    "title": "Coronary Artery Calcification in Hemodialysis and Peritoneal Dialysis.",
    "content": "Vascular calcification is seen in most patients on dialysis and is strongly associated with cardiovascular mortality. Vascular calcification is promoted by phosphate, which generally reaches higher levels in hemodialysis than in peritoneal dialysis. However, whether vascular calcification develops less in peritoneal dialysis than in hemodialysis is currently unknown. Therefore, we compared coronary artery calcification (CAC), its progression, and calcification biomarkers between patients on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.We measured CAC in 134 patients who had been treated exclusively with hemodialysis (n = 94) or peritoneal dialysis (n = 40) and were transplantation candidates. In 57 of them (34 on hemodialysis and 23 on peritoneal dialysis), we also measured CAC progression annually up to 3 years and the inactive species of desphospho-uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein (dp-ucMGP), fetuin-A, osteoprotegerin. We compared CAC cross-sectionally with Tobit regression. CAC progression was compared in 2 ways: with linear mixed models as the difference in square root transformed volume score per year (\u0394CAC SQRV) and with Tobit mixed models. We adjusted for potential confounders.In the cross-sectional cohort, CAC volume scores were 92 mm3 in hemodialysis and 492 mm3 in peritoneal dialysis (adjusted difference 436 mm3; 95% CI -47 to 919; p = 0.08). In the longitudinal cohort, peritoneal dialysis was associated with significantly more CAC progression defined as \u0394CAC SQRV (adjusted difference 1.20; 95% CI 0.09 to 2.31; p = 0.03), but not with Tobit mixed models (adjusted difference in CAC score increase per year 106 mm3; 95% CI -140 to 352; p = 0.40). Peritoneal dialysis was associated with higher osteoprotegerin (adjusted p = 0.02) but not with dp-ucMGP or fetuin-A.Peritoneal dialysis is not associated with less CAC or CAC progression than hemodialysis, and perhaps with even more progression. This indicates that vascular calcification does not develop less in peritoneal dialysis than in hemodialysis."

    "content": "For dialysis patients with end-stage kidney disease, infectious diseases (IDs) are the most common causes of hospitalization and death. However, the association between dialysis modality and IDs remains unclear. We aimed to determine the association between the dialysis modality and IDs.This retrospective observational cohort study compared the emergency hospitalization and mortality for IDs between peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) patients. After propensity score matching, the risk factors were evaluated by the Cox proportional hazard regression models.A total of 260 patients were compared - 130 of 135 PD and 130 of 706 HD patients. When the modality-specific ID (PD-catheter ID/peritonitis- and vascular access-related ID) was excluded, no significant differences in emergency hospitalization and mortality rates for overall IDs were observed between the PD and HD groups. Serum ferritin (HR, 2.17; CI, 1.06-4.43; p = 0.03) and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) (HR, 1.24; CI, 1.01-1.52; p = 0.04) were significant predictors of emergency hospitalization for IDs, whereas age (HR, 1.12; CI, 1.05-1.19; p < 0.001), male (HR, 3.38; CI, 1.01-11.3; p = 0.048), serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (HR, 6.87; CI, 2.18-21.7; p = 0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (HR, 10.7; CI, 3.55-32.1; p < 0.001), and CCI (HR, 1.79; CI, 1.27-2.52; p < 0.001) were significant predictors of ID mortality. When modality-specific ID was included, the emergency hospitalization rate for overall IDs was higher in the PD groups, and PD was a significant predictor of emergency hospitalization for IDs, whereas no significant difference in mortality rate for overall IDs was found between the PD and HD groups.ID events were not associated with dialysis modality when modality-specific ID was excluded, whereas the risk of modality-specific IDs was higher in PD than HD. Serum ferritin and ALP as well as age, male sex, CRP, and CCI were the risk factors for ID events."

Systolic dyssynchrony index (SDI_16) is a new diagnostic tool for detection of subclinical left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction by using three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE). We aimed to investigate this parameter in patients with end-stage renal disease who were receiving hemodialysis and patients with renal transplant compared to healthy control subjects.Forty-five hemodialysis patients, 45 patients with renal transplant and 45 age-sex matched healthy control subjects included in the study. All participants were evaluated with 3DE in the interdialytic phase for measurement of LV volumes, ejection fraction and SDI_16 parameter.Both LV diastolic and systolic volumes were significantly higher in hemodialysis group compared to renal transplant group and healthy controls, but this finding did not translate to a statistically significant difference for LVEF measurements between groups (58.71 \u00b1 3.53 vs. 57.17 \u00b1 2.97 vs. 59.23 \u00b1 3.26, p = .16 for renal transplant and hemodialysis and healthy control groups, respectively).

    "content": "Sudden death is one of the more frequent causes of death for hemodialysis patients, but the underlying mechanisms, contribution of arrhythmia, and associations with serum chemistries or the dialysis procedure are incompletely understood. To study this, implantable loop recorders were utilized for continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring to detect clinically significant arrhythmias including sustained ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, asystole, or symptomatic arrhythmias in hemodialysis patients over six months. Serum chemistries were tested pre- and post-dialysis at least weekly. Dialysis procedure data were collected at every session. Associations with clinically significant arrhythmias were assessed using negative binomial regression modeling. Sixty-six patients were implanted and 1678 events were recorded in 44 patients. The majority were bradycardias (1461), with 14 episodes of asystole and only one of sustained ventricular tachycardia. Atrial fibrillation, although not defined as clinically significant arrhythmias, was detected in 41% of patients. With thrice-weekly dialysis, the rate was highest during the first dialysis session of the week and was increased during the last 12 hours of each inter-dialytic interval, particularly the long interval. Among serum and dialytic parameters, only higher pre-dialysis serum sodium and dialysate calcium over 2.5 mEq/L were independently associated with clinically significant arrhythmias. Thus, clinically significant arrhythmias are common in hemodialysis patients, and bradycardia and asystole rather than ventricular tachycardia may be key causes of sudden death in hemodialysis patients. Associations with the temporal pattern of dialysis suggest that modification of current dialysis practices could reduce the incidence of sudden death."

    "content": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the intraocular pressure during hemodialysis and hemodiafiltration. Fifteen patients were enrolled (seven treated with hemodialysis therapy and eight with hemodiafiltration). The intraocular pressure was measured before and after dialysis and every 30 min during dialysis. Before dialysis, both groups had similar dialysis prescription, blood pressure, and biochemical parameters. At the end of dialysis, potassium, and osmolarity decreased in both groups, while systolic blood pressure and sodium decreased in the hemodialysis group, and glucose decreased in the hemodiafiltration group. Mean intraocular pressure was similar between groups at all measured times and had no significant changes during hemodialysis. During minute 120 of hemodiafiltration, mean intraocular pressure in the left eye decreased significantly compared to minute 90. This suggests a high intra-individual variability of intraocular pressure during both types of dialysis, which could be relevant particularly among those with the risk of glaucoma."

    "content": "Chronic renal failure can lead to dialysis and/or a kidney transplant in the final stage. The number of patients under dialysis has increased considerably in the world and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Dialysis is a very expensive care. This is the reason why this study on the costs of dialysis management was initiated in Burkina Faso. The objective of the study is to determine the direct medical and non-medical costs of managing chronic renal failure among dialysis patients in Ouagadougou in 2020.An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted. Data were collected in the hemodialysis department of three public university hospitals in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. All dialysis patients with chronic renal failure were included in the study. Linear regression was used to investigate the determinants of the direct medical and non-medical cost of hemodialysis.A total of 290 patients participated in this study, including children, adults, and the elderly with extremes of 12 and 82 years. Almost half of the patients (47.5%) had no income. The average monthly total direct cost across all patients was 75842 CFA or US$134.41.The average direct medical cost was 51315 CFA or US$90.94 and the average direct non-medical cost was 24 527 CFA or US$43.47. Most of the patients (45.2%) funded their hemodialysis by their own source. The multivariate analysis showed that the presence of an accompanying person during treatment, residing in a rural area, ambulatory care, use of personal cars, and treatment at the dialysis center of Yalgado Teaching Hospital were associated with higher direct costs.The average cost of dialysis services borne by the patient and his family is very high in Burkina Faso, since it is 2.1 times higher than the country's minimum interprofessional wage (34664 CFA or US$61.4). It appears that the precariousness of the means of subsistence increases strongly with the onset of chronic renal failure requiring dialysis. Thus, to alleviate the expenses borne by dialysis patients, it would be important to extend the government subsidy scheme to the cost of drugs and to promote health insurance to ensure equitable care for these patients."

Effective symptom management is a priority for individuals receiving hemodialysis. Aerobic exercise may be an effective, nonpharmacologic treatment for specific hemodialysis-related symptoms. This systematic review investigated the effect of aerobic exercise on hemodialysis-related symptoms in adults with kidney failure undergoing maintenance hemodialysis.We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, EMBASE, PEDro, and Scopus databases from 1960 or inception until April 15, 2020 for randomized controlled trials investigating the effect of aerobic exercise on hemodialysis-related symptoms, identified as prespecified primary or secondary outcomes, as compared with controls in adults on maintenance hemodialysis. We identified restless legs syndrome as the primary outcome.Of 3048 studies identified, 15 randomized controlled trials met the eligibility criteria. These studies investigated the effect of aerobic exercise on restless legs syndrome (two studies), sleep disturbance (four studies), anxiety (four studies), depression (nine studies), muscle cramping (one study), and fatigue (one study). Exercise interventions were intradialytic in ten studies and outside of hemodialysis in five studies. Heterogenous interventions and outcomes and moderate to high risk of bias precluded meta-analysis for most symptoms. Aerobic exercise demonstrated improvement in symptoms of restless legs syndrome, muscle cramping, and fatigue, as compared with nonexercise controls. Meta-analysis of depressive symptoms in studies using the Beck Depression Inventory demonstrated a greater reduction in Beck Depression Inventory score with exercise as compared with control (mean difference -7.57; 95% confidence interval, -8.25 to -6.89).Our review suggests that in adults on maintenance hemodialysis, aerobic exercise improves several hemodialysis-related symptoms, including restless legs syndrome, symptoms of depression, muscle cramping, and fatigue. However, the use of validated outcome measures with demonstrated reliability and responsiveness in more diverse hemodialysis populations is required to fully characterize the effect of this intervention.PROSPERO #CRD42017056658."

    "content": "Much attention is given to patient and provider engagement, cost, and quality. Nephrology is in a unique position to examine the intersection of these issues given kidney dialysis is delivered at a high cost to chronically ill patients. Annual dialysis treatments in Canada range from $56,000-$107,000 per patient dependent on modality. Economists quantify the preferred modality by calculating cost effectiveness through quality-adjusted life years or determining utilization through Discrete Choice Experiments (DCEs). Cost-effectiveness studies identify peritoneal dialysis as the most economical, yet it is the least used. Discrete choice experiments address patient preferences but rarely include cost attributes. This presents a unique paradigm: cost studies do not include patient or physician perspectives, and DCEs do not consider cost. This systematic review of dialysis cost-effectiveness studies and DCEs identifies an opportunity to increase engagement and transparency by involving all care partners in assessing quality and cost."

To determine whether hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis provide a better QoL, a systematic meta-analysis was performed.We searched through the database Cinahl, Medline, PubMed, Scopus and Proquest, including articles published from 2011 until June 2016. We selected articles that compared, through KDQOL-SF 1.3 or 36 questionnaires, QoL among patients undergoing hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. The data was collected using Excel Office, and t-test has been performed on independent samples to identify significant differences.Only some of the seven articles found significant differences between the two treatments. One of the studies showed a better QoL for peritoneal dialysis patients, while, on the contrary, two other studies support that the best QoL is in patients receiving hemodialysis. Another article displayed significant difference only for satisfaction in relation to care, better in patients on peritoneal dialysis, and for physical health, better in hemodialysis.The analysis has not led to a unanimous conclusion. Quantitative analysis showed that the only statistically significant difference between the QoL of patients on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis regards the effect of kidney disease, which happens to be better in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis."

    "content": "Haemodialysis (HD) was the first procedure that had demonstrated the ability to partially replace renal function, and became the most widely utilized treatment for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In a great majority of countries around the world, conventional in-centre HD had become the predominant renal replacement therapy, being touted as able to achieve better solute clearance and more successful in attaining euvolemia than patients on peritoneal dialysis. This is despite the antecedent hemodynamic risks, more rapid loss of residual renal function, greater infectious perils, excessive erythropoietin requirements and higher infrastructure costs. In addition, quality of life had been suggested to be worse among patients on HD, though this had been challenged repeatedly. Consequently, the concept of integrated ESRD care over the last few decades had placed HD, as a complementary rather than a competitive treatment modality to the entire armamentarium of renal replacement therapies. Incorporating HD as part of integrated care into health-care policies and national resource planning will become an essential strategy in improving access and outcome to care among the ESRD population. The improvement in technologies and innovation in prescription had brought forth enhanced dialyzer membrane and machine upgrades, and expanded modalities including more frequent HD and haemodiafiltration. While boasting of controversial improvement in outcomes, many of these therapies remain expensive and insurmountable for widespread utility in many countries. In addition, the results of these new technologies had been conflicting across studies, with some even suggesting that they could be detrimental. Therefore, judicial consideration has to be undertaken to appropriate their use in clinical practice."

We screened for AF clinically by pulse palpation, precordial auscultation, by an automated blood pressure monitor and an electrocardiogram. The researchers reported qualitative variables as counts and frequencies, while continuous variables were summarised using the mean or median where necessary. We used multiple logistic regression with backward selection to identify independent risk factors of AF.A total of 231 patients were enrolled; mean age was 54.8\u2009\u00b1\u200915.6\u2009years (from 20 to 86), and 44.3% of them were women. The prevalence of AF was found to be 7.8% (95% CI, 4.8-12.2), with no gender disparity. Age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]\u2009=\u20091.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.10; p\u2009=\u20090.031), history of ischaemic heart disease (AOR\u2009=\u20093.74; 95% CI, 1.09-12.34; p\u2009=\u20090.033), history of smoking (AOR\u2009=\u20090.15; 95% CI, 0.02-0.60; p\u2009=\u20090.019), and low interdialytic weight gain (AOR\u2009=\u20090.50: 95% CI, 0.25-0.91; p\u2009=\u20090.031) were independently correlated to AF.The prevalence of AF among patients on maintenance haemodialysis is high, but largely undiagnosed. AF is generally associated with advancing age, history of ischaemic heart disease, lower interdialytic weight gain, and history of smoking. We suggest routine check-up of AF in this high-risk group of patients as anticoagulant therapy if indicated may prevent serious complications. However, there is a need for large-scale cohort studies and for the creation of regional chronic kidney disease and dialysis registries in the Middle East region."

    "content": "microRNA-122 (miR-122) is a hepatotoxicity biomarker with utility in the management of paracetamol overdose and in drug development. Renal dysfunction and haemodialysis have been associated with a reduction in circulating microRNA. The objective of this study was to determine their effect on miR-122.Blood samples were collected from 17 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on haemodialysis, 22 healthy controls, 30 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 15 patients post-kidney transplantation. All had normal standard liver function tests. Samples from ESRD patients were collected immediately pre- and post-haemodialysis. Serum alanine transaminase activity (ALT), miR-122 and miR-885 (liver enriched) were compared.Circulating miR-122 was substantially reduced in ESRD patients pre-haemodialysis compared with the other groups (19.0-fold lower than healthy controls; 21.7-fold lower than CKD). Haemodialysis increased miR-122 from a median value of 6.7 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> (2.3 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> -1.4 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> ) to 1.6 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> (5.4 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> -3.2 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> ) copies\u00a0ml<sup>-1</sup> . The increase in miR-122 did not correlate with dialysis adequacy. miR-122 was reduced in the argonaute 2 bound fraction pre-haemodialysis; this fraction was increased post-dialysis. There was no change in miR-122 associated with extracellular vesicles. miR-885 was also reduced in ESRD patients (4-fold compared to healthy subjects) and increased by haemodialysis.miR-122 is substantially lower in ESRD compared to healthy controls, patients with CKD and transplanted patients. Haemodialysis increases the concentration of miR-122. These data need to be considered when interpreting liver injury using miR-122 in patients with ESRD on dialysis, and specific reference ranges that define normal in this setting may need to be developed."
