    "content": "Human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMN<sub>HPV</sub> ) in childhood cancer survivors are poorly understood.The cumulative risk of SMN<sub>HPV</sub> was assessed among 24,363 Childhood Cancer Survivor Study participants. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and absolute excess risk were calculated using age-matched, sex-matched, and calendar year rates from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. Poisson regression models identified SMN<sub>HPV</sub> risk factors, evaluating relative SIRs (rSIR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).In total, 46 survivors developed an SMN<sub>HPV</sub> (median age, 31 years [range, 10-56 years]; median time from primary cancer, 21 years [range, 9-35 years]). SMN<sub>HPV</sub> sites included oropharynx (N = 44), anorectum (N = 6), uterine cervix (N = 2), and vulva (N = 2). The 33-year cumulative incidence was 0.3% (95% CI, 0.2%-0.4%), and the SIR was nearly 3-fold that of the general population (SIR, 2.86; 95% CI, 2.05-4.00). Female survivors were not at increased risk of cervical or vulvar cancers compared with the general population. All survivors had an elevated risk of oropharyngeal SMN<sub>HPV</sub> (males: SIR, 4.06; 95% CI, 2.37-6.97; females: SIR, 8.44; 95% CI 4.88-14.61) and anorectal SMN<sub>HPV</sub> (males: SIR, 13.56; 95% CI, 5.09-36.13; females: SIR, 9.15; 95% CI, 2.29-36.61). Males (vs females: rSIR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.00-3.94); head, neck, and pelvic radiotherapy doses >3000 centigray (vs none: rSIR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.11-4.97); and cisplatin-equivalent doses >400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (vs none: rSIR, 4.51; 95% CI, 1.78-11.43) were associated with increased SMN<sub>HPV</sub> SIRs in multivariable analysis.Childhood cancer survivors are at increased risk for SMN in sites susceptible to HPV-associated malignancies. Further research examining HPV in the etiology of SMN and the promotion of HPV vaccination and surveillance guidelines for SMN<sub>HPV</sub> in cancer survivors is warranted."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Evidence about late effects in adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors is scarce. This study assessed the risk of subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMNs) to identify the most common SMNs to be considered in follow-up care.Population-based cancer registries retrospectively identified first primary tumors (between 1976 and 2013) and SMNs in AYAs (15-39\u00a0years old at their cancer diagnosis). AYA cancer survivors were those alive at least 5\u00a0years after their first cancer diagnosis. The excess risk of SMNs was measured as standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and absolute excess risk together with the cumulative incidence of SMNs.The cohort included 67,692 AYA cancer survivors. The excess risk of developing any SMN (SIR, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-1.7) was 60%. The excess risk of SMNs was significantly high for survivors of lymphomas; cancers of the breast, thyroid, female genital tract, digestive organs, gonads, and urinary tract; and melanomas. The cumulative incidence of all SMNs in AYA cancer survivors within 25\u00a0years of their first cancer diagnosis was approximately 10%. Subsequent tumors contributing to approximately 60% of all SMNs were breast cancer, colorectal cancer, corpus uteri cancer, and ovarian cancer in females and colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and lymphomas in males.These results highlight the need to personalize follow-up strategies for AYA cancer survivors."

    "title": "Radiation-response in primary fibroblasts of long-term survivors of childhood cancer with and without second primary neoplasms: the KiKme study.",
    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "The etiology and most risk factors for a sporadic first primary neoplasm in childhood or subsequent second primary neoplasms are still unknown. One established causal factor for therapy-associated second primary neoplasms is the exposure to ionizing radiation during radiation therapy as a mainstay of cancer treatment. Second primary neoplasms occur in 8% of all cancer survivors within 30\u00a0years after the first diagnosis in Germany, but the underlying factors for intrinsic susceptibilities have not yet been clarified. Thus, the purpose of this nested case-control study was the investigation and comparison of gene expression and affected pathways in primary fibroblasts of childhood cancer survivors with a first primary neoplasm only or with at least one subsequent second primary neoplasm, and controls without neoplasms after exposure to a low and a high dose of ionizing radiation.Primary fibroblasts were obtained from skin biopsies from 52 adult donors with a first primary neoplasm in childhood (N1), 52 with at least one additional primary neoplasm (N2+), as well as 52 without cancer (N0) from the KiKme study. Cultured fibroblasts were exposed to a high [2 Gray (Gy)] and a low dose (0.05\u00a0Gy) of X-rays. Messenger ribonucleic acid was extracted 4\u00a0h after exposure and Illumina-sequenced. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were computed using limma for R, selected at a false discovery rate level of 0.05, and further analyzed for pathway enrichment (right-tailed Fisher's Exact Test) and (in-) activation (z\u2009\u2265|2|) using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.After 0.05\u00a0Gy, least DEGs were found in N0 (n\u2009=\u2009236), compared to N1 (n\u2009=\u2009653) and N2+\u2009(n\u2009=\u2009694). The top DEGs with regard to the adjusted p-value were upregulated in fibroblasts across all donor groups (SESN1, MDM2, CDKN1A, TIGAR, BTG2, BLOC1S2, PPM1D, PHLDB3, FBXO22, AEN, TRIAP1, and POLH). Here, we observed activation of p53 Signaling in N0 and to a lesser extent in N1, but not in N2+. Only in N0, DNA (excision-) repair (involved genes: CDKN1A, PPM1D, and DDB2) was predicted to be a downstream function, while molecular networks in N2+\u2009were associated with cancer, as well as injury and abnormalities (among others, downregulation of MSH6, CCNE2, and CHUK). After 2\u00a0Gy, the number of DEGs was similar in fibroblasts of all donor groups and genes with the highest absolute log<sub>2</sub> fold-change were upregulated throughout (CDKN1A, TIGAR, HSPA4L, MDM2, BLOC1SD2, PPM1D, SESN1, BTG2, FBXO22, PCNA, and TRIAP1). Here, the p53 Signaling-Pathway was activated in fibroblasts of all donor groups. The Mitotic Roles of Polo Like Kinase-Pathway was inactivated in N1 and N2+. Molecular Mechanisms of Cancer were affected in fibroblasts of all donor groups. P53 was predicted to be an upstream regulator in fibroblasts of all donor groups and E2F1 in N1 and N2+. Results of the downstream analysis were senescence in N0 and N2+, transformation of cells in N0, and no significant effects in N1. Seven genes were differentially expressed in reaction to 2\u00a0Gy dependent on the donor group (LINC00601, COBLL1, SESN2, BIN3, TNFRSF10A, EEF1AKNMT, and BTG2).Our results show dose-dependent differences in the radiation response between N1/N2+\u2009and N0. While mechanisms against genotoxic stress were activated to the same extent after a high dose in all groups, the radiation response was impaired after a low dose in N1/N2+, suggesting an increased risk for adverse effects including carcinogenesis, particularly in N2+."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Therapeutic radiation in childhood cancer has decreased over time with a concomitant increase in chemotherapy. Limited data exist on chemotherapy-associated subsequent malignant neoplasm (SMN) risk.SMNs occurring > 5 years from diagnosis, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers, were evaluated in survivors diagnosed when they were < 21 years old, from 1970 to 1999 in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (median age at diagnosis, 7.0 years; median age at last follow-up, 31.8 years). Thirty-year SMN cumulative incidence and standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were estimated by treatment: chemotherapy-only (n = 7,448), chemotherapy plus radiation (n = 10,485), radiation only (n = 2,063), or neither (n = 2,158). Multivariable models were used to assess chemotherapy-associated SMN risk, including dose-response relationships.Of 1,498 SMNs among 1,344 survivors, 229 occurred among 206 survivors treated with chemotherapy only. Thirty-year SMN cumulative incidence was 3.9%, 9.0%, 10.8%, and 3.4% for the chemotherapy-only, chemotherapy plus radiation, radiation-only, or neither-treatment groups, respectively. Chemotherapy-only survivors had a 2.8-fold increased SMN risk compared with the general population (95% CI, 2.5 to 3.2), with SIRs increased for subsequent leukemia/lymphoma (1.9; 95% CI, 1.3 to 2.7), breast cancer (4.6; 95% CI, 3.5 to 6.0), soft-tissue sarcoma (3.4; 95% CI, 1.9 to 5.7), thyroid cancer (3.8; 95% CI, 2.7 to 5.1), and melanoma (2.3; 95% CI, 1.5 to 3.5). SMN rate was associated with > 750 mg/m<sup>2</sup> platinum (relative rate [RR] 2.7; 95% CI, 1.1 to 6.5), and a dose response was observed between alkylating agents and SMN rate (RR, 1.2/5,000 mg/m<sup>2</sup>; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.3). A linear dose response was also demonstrated between anthracyclines and breast cancer rate (RR, 1.3/100 mg/m<sup>2</sup>; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.6).Childhood cancer survivors treated with chemotherapy only, particularly higher cumulative doses of platinum and alkylating agents, face increased SMN risk. Linear dose responses were seen between alkylating agents and SMN rates and between anthracyclines and breast cancer rates. Limiting cumulative doses and consideration of alternate chemotherapies may reduce SMN risk."

    "content": "The aim of the study was to characterize subsequent neoplasm (SN) (malignant (SMN), benign (BSNs), and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC)) treated previously for a childhood solid malignant tumor at the Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Motol University Hospital, Prague.We evaluated a cohort of 4059 childhood cancer survivors treated between 1975 and 2018.From 4059 survivors, 170 (4.3 %) developed at least one SMN - 193 SMNs in 170 survivors, 21 of them (0.5 % of all survivors) had two or more SMNs and 34 of them (0.8 %) had one SMN and one or more BSNs. Mortality for an SMN was 38.2 % i.e. 1.6 % of all survivors. The most frequent SMNs were thyroid carcinoma (37, 19.2 %), tumors of the central nervous system (25, 13.0 %), soft tissue sarcoma (23, 11.9 %), breast carcinoma (19, 9.8 %), and leukemia (11, 5.7 %). Genetic syndromes were present in 25 patients with SMNs (14.7 %) and in 16 patients with only BSNs (13.4 %). SMNs usually developed in second decade or later after finishing of therapy. We observed some not well known risk factors of SNs e.g. spinal irradiation or<sup>131-</sup>I metaiodobenzylguanidine radiotherapy in 2 cases of secondary thyroid cancer, cyclophosphamide therapy in all 8 cases of secondary urinary bladder sarcoma or 4 from 7 SNMSC developed SMN.We confirmed data from previous studies of SNs and observed some not so well known risk factors. Our results and the literature show that the incidence of SMNs is 3-10 % of survivors and is associated with high mortality."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "To evaluate childhood cancer survivors' adherence to surveillance protocols for late effects of treatment and to determine the factors affecting adherence.Between 2014 and 2016, 11,337 survivors and 2,146 siblings in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study completed a survey ascertaining adherence to Children's Oncology Group (COG) guidelines for survivors at high risk for second malignant neoplasms or cardiac dysfunction and to the American Cancer Society (ACS) cancer screening guidelines for average-risk populations. Adherence rates and factors affecting adherence were analyzed.Median age at diagnosis was 7 years (range, 0-20.9 years), and median time from diagnosis was 29 years (range, 15-47 years). Among high-risk survivors, adherence to COG breast, colorectal, skin, and cardiac surveillance was 12.6% (95% CI, 10.0% to 15.3%), 37.0% (34.1% to 39.9%), 22.3% (21.2% to 23.4%), and 41.4% (40.1% to 42.7%), respectively. Among average-risk survivors, adherence to ACS breast, cervical, and colorectal screening was 57.1% (53.2% to 61.0%), 83.6% (82.7% to 84.5%), and 68.5% (64.7% to 72.2%), respectively. Twenty-seven percent of survivors and 20.0% of primary care providers (PCPs) had a survivorship care plan (SCP). For high-risk survivors, SCP possession was associated with increased adherence to COG breast (22.3% <i>v</i>. 8.1%; prevalence ratio [PR], 2.52; CI, 1.59 to 4.01), skin (34.8% <i>v</i> 23.0%; PR, 1.16; CI, 1.01 to 1.33), and cardiac (67.0% <i>v</i> 33.1%; PR, 1.73; CI, 1.55 to 1.92) surveillance. For high-risk survivors, PCP possession of a SCP was associated only with increased adherence to COG skin cancer surveillance (36.9% <i>v</i> 23.2%; PR, 1.24; CI, 1.08 to 1.43).Guideline adherence is suboptimal. Although survivor SCP possession is associated with better adherence, few survivors and PCPs have one. New strategies to improve adherence are needed."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Marked reductions in childhood cancer mortality occurred over the last decades in high-income countries and, to a lesser degree, in middle-income countries. This study aimed to monitor mortality trends in the Americas and Australasia, focusing on areas showing unsatisfactory trends.Age-standardized mortality rates per 100,000 children (aged 0-14\u00a0years) from 1990 to 2017 (or the last available calendar year) were computed for all neoplasms and 8 leading childhood cancers in countries from the Americas and Australasia, using data from the World Health Organization database. A joinpoint regression was used to identify changes in slope of mortality trends for all neoplasms, leukemia, and neoplasms of the central nervous system (CNS) for major countries.Over the last decades, childhood cancer mortality continued to decrease by approximately 2% to 3% per year in Australasian countries (ie, Japan, Korea, and Australia), by approximately 1.5% to 2% in North America and Chile, and 1% in Argentina. Other Latin American countries did not show any substantial decrease. Leukemia mortality declined in most countries, whereas less favorable trends were registered for CNS neoplasms, particularly in Latin America. Around 2016, death rates from all neoplasms were 4 to 6 per 100,000 boys and 3 to 4 per 100,000 girls in Latin America, and 2 to 3 per 100,000 boys and approximately 2 per 100,000 girls in North America and Australasia.Childhood cancer mortality trends declined steadily in North America and Australasia, whereas they were less favorable in most Latin American countries. Priority must be given to closing the gap by providing high-quality care for all children with cancer worldwide.Advances in childhood cancer management have substantially improved the burden of these neoplasms over the past 40\u00a0years, particularly in high-income countries. This study aimed to monitor recent trends in America and Australasia using mortality data from the World Health Organization. Trends in childhood cancer mortality continued to decline in high-income countries by approximately 2% to 3% per year in Japan, Korea, and Australia, and 1% to 2% in North America. Only a few Latin American countries showed favorable trends, including Argentina, Chile, and Mexico, whereas other countries with limited resources still lagged behind."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Birth defects are established risk factors for childhood cancer. Nonetheless, cancer epidemiology in children with birth defects is not well characterized.Using data from population-based registries in 4 US states, this study compared children with cancer but no birth defects (n\u00a0=\u00a013,111) with children with cancer and 1 or more nonsyndromic birth defects (n\u00a0=\u00a01616). The objective was to evaluate cancer diagnostic characteristics, including tumor type, age at diagnosis, and stage at diagnosis.Compared with the general population of children with cancer, children with birth defects were diagnosed with more embryonal tumors (26.6% vs 18.7%; q\u00a0<\u00a00.001), including neuroblastoma (12.5% vs 8.2%; q\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and hepatoblastoma (5.0% vs 1.3%; q\u00a0<\u00a00.001), but fewer hematologic malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (12.4% vs 24.4%; q\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In age-stratified analyses, differences in tumor type were evident among children younger than 1\u00a0year and children 1 to 4\u00a0years old, but they were attenuated among children 5 years of age or older. The age at diagnosis was younger in children with birth defects for most cancers, including leukemia, lymphoma, astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma, embryonal tumors, and germ cell tumors (all q\u00a0<\u00a00.05).The results indicate possible etiologic heterogeneity in children with birth defects, have implications for future surveillance efforts, and raise the possibility of differential cancer ascertainment in children with birth defects.Scientific studies suggest that children with birth defects are at increased risk for cancer. However, these studies have not been able to determine whether important tumor characteristics, such as the type of tumor diagnosed, the age at which the tumor is diagnosed, and the degree to which the tumor has spread at the time of diagnosis, are different for children with birth defects and children without birth defects. This study attempts to answer these important questions. By doing so, it may help scientists and physicians to understand the causes of cancer in children with birth defects and diagnose cancer at earlier stages when it is more treatable."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Childhood cancer patients are at increased risk of second primary neoplasms (SPNs). We assessed incidence and risk factors for early SPNs with a focus on cancer predisposition syndromes (CPSs).This cohort study used data from the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry. We included patients with first primary neoplasms (FPNs) diagnosed before age 21 years from 1986 to 2015 and identified SPNs occurring before age 21. We calculated standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) and absolute excess risks (AERs) using Swiss population cancer incidence data, and cumulative incidence of SPNs. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) of risk factors for SPNs using Fine and Gray competing risk regression.Among 8074 childhood cancer patients, 304 (4%) were diagnosed with a CPS and 94 (1%) developed early SPNs. The incidence of SPNs was more than 10-fold higher in childhood cancer patients than the incidence of neoplasms in the general population (SIR = 10.6, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.7-13.1) and the AER was 179/100,000 person-years (CI: 139-219). Cumulative incidence of SPNs 20 years after FPN diagnosis was 23% in patients with CPSs (CI: 12-41%) and 2.7% in those without (CI: 2.0-3.6%). Risk factors for SPNs were CPSs (HR = 7.8, CI: 4.8-12.7), chemotherapy (HR = 2.2, CI: 1.1-4.6), radiotherapy (HR = 1.9, CI = 1.2-2.9), haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HR = 1.8, CI: 1-3.3), and older age (15-20 years) at FPN diagnosis (HR = 1.9, CI: 1.1-3.2).CPSs are associated with a high risk of SPNs before age 21 years. Identification of CPSs is important for appropriate cancer surveillance and targeted screening."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Obesity is a known modifiable risk factor associated with adverse outcomes in children with cancer. We sought to determine whether obesity during childhood cancer treatment increases risk for second malignant neoplasms (SMN).In this case-control study, cases (with SMN) and controls (with a single-primary cancer) were selected from the California Cancer Registry who had primary cancer diagnosed <21 years treated at Children's Hospital Los Angeles between 1988 and 2014. Controls were matched 3:1 to cases at the registry level by clinical factors. Medical records were abstracted for cancer treatment exposures, cancer predisposition syndrome, body mass index (BMI), BMI Z-score, and BMI category at diagnosis and end of therapy (EOT).A total of 59 cases and 130 controls were included. Median age at primary cancer diagnosis was 6 years, 64.5% were male, median time from primary cancer to SMN was 7.5 years, and 31.7% were obese or overweight. In matched multivariable analyses, there were elevated but nonsignificant associations between SMN and higher BMI Z-score at diagnosis [OR 1.27 (0.99-1.63)] and higher BMI categories at diagnosis [adjusted OR (aOR) overweight, 1.25 (0.55-2.52); aOR obese, 2.51 (1.00-6.29)]. There was a significantly increased risk for SMN among patients who were obese at both diagnosis and EOT [aOR, 4.44 (1.37-14.34)].This study suggests that obesity during childhood cancer treatment may be associated with increased risk for SMNs, particularly among those obese throughout therapy.Additional studies to confirm these findings and to develop interventions have the potential to impact SMN development in children with cancer."

There was a predominance of male patients, aged 50-59 years, mostly Caucasians, and with a low level of schooling. Throughout the period there was a significant reduction in the positive history of alcohol and tobacco consumption, except for alcoholic beverages in oral cavity cancer. Most patients were diagnosed at an advanced stage of the disease (III or IV). Most patients with oral cavity cancer had no evidence of the disease on follow-up, while most patients with oropharyngeal cancer died. The first most frequent treatment offered to patients with oral cavity cancer was surgery, while for patients with oropharyngeal cancer it chemoradiotherapy predominated.Despite the fact that, in general, there was a reduction in the records of patient alcohol and tobacco consumption, the increase in the number of medical consultations, the predominantly late diagnosis and the patients' low level of schooling indicate the need for health education, primary prevention and early diagnosis of cancer of the oral cavity and oropharynx."

The cumulative incidence of SGMNs was estimated by Fine-Gray competing risk regression. Poisson regression was used to evaluate the radiotherapy-associated risk for SGMNs in patients undergoing radiotherapy vs patients not undergoing radiotherapy. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess the survival outcomes of patients with SGMNs.Of 20\u202f142 patients, 16\u202f802 patients (83.4%) were White and the median age was 65 years (interquartile range, 54-74 years).

The cumulative incidence of SGMNs during 30 years of follow-up was 4.53% among patients who received radiotherapy and 1.53% among patients who did not. In competing risk regression analysis, undergoing radiotherapy was associated with a higher risk of developing cancer of the uterine corpus (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.06; 95% CI, 2.14-4.37; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and ovarian cancer (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.22-3.56; P\u2009=\u2009.007) compared with those who did not receive radiotherapy. The dynamic radiotherapy-associated risks (RR) for cancer of the uterine corpus significantly increased with increasing age at rectal cancer diagnosis (aged 20-49 years: adjusted RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.35-1.79; P\u2009=\u2009.57; aged 50-69 years: adjusted RR, 3.74; 95% CI, 2.63-5.32; P\u2009<\u2009.001; aged \u226570 years: adjusted RR, 5.13; 95% CI, 2.64-9.97; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and decreased with increasing latency since rectal cancer diagnosis (60-119 months: adjusted RR, 3.22; 95% CI, 2.12-4.87; P\u2009<\u2009.001; 120-239 months: adjusted RR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.75-4.24; P\u2009<\u2009.001; 240-360 months: adjusted RR, 1.95; 95% CI, 0.67-5.66; P\u2009=\u2009.22), but the dynamic RR for ovarian cancer increased with increasing latency since rectal cancer diagnosis (60-119 months: adjusted RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.26-1.89; P\u2009=\u2009.48; 120-239 months: adjusted RR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.09-4.70; P\u2009=\u2009.03; 240-360 months: adjusted RR, 11.84; 95% CI, 2.18-64.33; P\u2009=\u2009.004). The 10-year overall survival among patients with radiotherapy-associated cancer of the uterine corpus was significantly lower than that among matched patients with primary cancer of the uterine corpus (21.5% vs 33.6%; P\u2009=\u2009.01).Radiotherapy for rectal cancer was associated with an increased risk of cancer of the uterine corpus and ovarian cancer. Special attention should be paid to reduce radiotherapy-associated SGMNs and improve their prognosis."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "In this study, we aimed to investigate the age-related risk of second breast cancer (SBC) and second gynecological malignant neoplasms (SGMNs) in female differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) survivors by utilizing the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.A total number of 55,622 female DTC patients were identified between 1975 and 2016, including 2168 patients who developed SBC and SGMNs. The Fine and Gray model was used to calculate the cumulative incidence and sub-distribution hazards ratios (SHR). Poisson regression analysis was employed to calculate the relative risk (RR) and standardized incidence ratio (SIR). Kaplan-Meier survival and log-rank test analyses were also performed.The overall 40-year cumulative incidence of SBC and SGMNs was 18.9%. Their incidence in the adolescent and young adults (AYA) group increased slowly in the first 30 years, but then was rapidly elevated in the last decade. It increased gradually in the middle-aged adults group and in the first 25 years in the older adults group, but it scarcely increased thereafter. Both the middle-aged adults (adjusted SHR, 2.09; RR, 1.76) and the older adults (adjusted SHR, 1.32; RR, 1.58) groups had higher risks of developing combined SBC and SGMNs than the AYA group. The risks increased mainly in the early latency period. The three groups also had higher SIRs than the US general population. Besides, the best survival after SBC and SGMNs was observed in the AYA group.Age was an independent risk factor for SBC and SGMNs incidences among female DTC survivors."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Childhood cancer survivors are confronted with various chronic health conditions like therapy-related malignancies. However, it is unclear how exposure to chemotherapy contributes to the mutation burden and clonal composition of healthy tissues early in life. Here, we studied mutation accumulation in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) before and after cancer treatment of 24 children. Of these children, 19 developed therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN). Posttreatment HSPCs had an average mutation burden increase comparable to what treatment-na\u00efve cells accumulate during 16 years of life, with excesses up to 80 years. In most children, these additional mutations were induced by clock-like processes, which are also active during healthy aging. Other patients harbored mutations that could be directly attributed to treatments like platinum-based drugs and thiopurines. Using phylogenetic inference, we demonstrate that most t-MN in children originate after the start of treatment and that leukemic clones become dominant during or directly after chemotherapy exposure.Our study shows that chemotherapy increases the mutation burden of normal blood cells in cancer survivors. Only few drugs damage the DNA directly, whereas in most patients, chemotherapy-induced mutations are caused by processes similar to those present during normal aging. This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1825."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Exposure to cranial radiotherapy is associated with an increased risk of subsequent CNS neoplasms among childhood, adolescent, and young adult (CAYA) cancer survivors. Surveillance for subsequent neoplasms can translate into early diagnoses and interventions that could improve cancer survivors' health and quality of life. The practice guideline presented here by the International Late Effects of Childhood Cancer Guideline Harmonization Group was developed with an evidence-based method that entailed the gathering and appraisal of published evidence associated with subsequent CNS neoplasms among CAYA cancer survivors. The preparation of these guidelines showed a paucity of high-quality evidence and highlighted the need for additional research to inform survivorship care. The recommendations are based on careful consideration of the evidence supporting the benefits, risks, and harms of the surveillance interventions, clinical judgment regarding individual patient circumstances, and the need to maintain flexibility of application across different health-care systems. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to establish whether early detection of subsequent CNS neoplasms reduces morbidity and mortality, and therefore no recommendation can be formulated for or against routine MRI surveillance. The decision to start surveillance should be made by the CAYA cancer survivor and health-care provider after careful consideration of the potential harms and benefits of surveillance for CNS neoplasms, including meningioma."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "To investigate cancer treatment plus pathogenic germline mutations (PGMs) in DNA repair genes (DRGs) for identification of childhood cancer survivors at increased risk of subsequent neoplasms (SNs).Whole-genome sequencing was performed on blood-derived DNA from survivors in the St Jude Lifetime Cohort. PGMs were evaluated in 127 genes from 6 major DNA repair pathways. Cumulative doses of chemotherapy and body region-specific radiotherapy (RT) were abstracted from medical records. Relative rates (RRs) and 95% CIs of SNs by mutation status were estimated using multivariable piecewise exponential models.Of 4,402 survivors, 495 (11.2%) developed 1,269 SNs. We identified 538 PGMs in 98 DRGs (<i>POLG</i>, <i>MUTYH</i>, <i>ERCC2</i>, and <i>BRCA2</i>, among others) in 508 (11.5%) survivors. Mutations in homologous recombination (HR) genes were significantly associated with an increased rate of subsequent female breast cancer (RR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.8 to 7.7), especially among survivors with chest RT \u2265 20 Gy (RR, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.6 to 12.4), or with a cumulative dose of anthracyclines in the second or third tertile (RR, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.7 to 11.4). Mutations in HR genes were also associated with an increased rate of subsequent sarcoma among those who received alkylating agent doses in the third tertile (RR, 14.9; 95% CI, 4.0 to 38.0). Mutations in nucleotide excision repair genes were associated with subsequent thyroid cancer for those treated with neck RT \u2265 30 Gy (RR, 12.9; 95% CI, 1.6 to 46.6) with marginal statistical significance.Our study provides novel insights regarding the contribution of genetics, in combination with known treatment-related risks, for the development of SNs. These findings have the potential to facilitate identification of high-risk survivors who may benefit from genetic counseling and/or testing of DRGs, which may further inform personalized cancer surveillance and prevention strategies."

In this study we estimate the cumulative burden of subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMN), cardiovascular and respiratory hospitalisations in long-term survivors of childhood and young adult cancers and associated treatment risks.Five-year survivors of cancer diagnosed aged 0-29 years between 1992-2009 in Yorkshire, UK were included. The cumulative count of all hospital admissions (including readmissions) for cardiovascular and respiratory conditions and all SMNs diagnosed up to 2015 was calculated, with death as a competing risk. Associations between treatment exposures and cumulative burden were investigated using multiple-failure time survival models.A total of 3464 5-year survivors were included with a median follow-up of 8.2 years (IQR 4-13 years). Ten-years post diagnosis, the cumulative incidence for a respiratory admission was 6.0 % (95 %CI 5.2-6.9), a cardiovascular admission was 2.0 % (95 %CI 1.5-2.5), and SMN was 1.0 % (95 % CI 0.7-1.4) with an average of 13 events per 100 survivors observed (95 %CI 11-15). The risk of experiencing multiple events was higher for those treated with chemotherapy drugs with known lung toxicity (HR = 1.35, 95 %CI 1.09-1.68).Survivors of childhood and young adult cancer experience a high burden of morbidity due to respiratory, cardiovascular diseases and SMNs up to 20-years post-diagnosis. Statistical methods that capture multiple morbidities and recurrent events are important when quantifying the burden of late effects in young cancer survivors."

    "content": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the detection rate of incidental second primary neoplasms in patients with prostate cancer on <sup>18</sup>F-fluciclovine PET/CT. <b>Methods:</b> Imaging reports and patient demographic data were retrospectively reviewed from 663 clinical <sup>18</sup>F-fluciclovine PET/CT studies, performed in 601 patients for the assessment of their prostate cancer (643 - recurrence evaluation, 20 - initial staging) from August 2016 to April 2021. Maximum SUV (SUV<sub>max</sub>) of the suspected second neoplasms was determined. The results of <sup>18</sup>F-fluciclovine PET/CT were correlated with clinical and radiologic studies to determine the nature of the suspected second neoplasms. <b>Results:</b> Fifty-five patients (9.1%) had findings suggestive of a second neoplasm. Thirty-nine of 55 had a known second neoplasm diagnosed before the PET/CT. An incidental second primary neoplasm was first suspected on <sup>18</sup>F-fluciclovine PET/CT in 16 of 601 patients (2.7%). Three of the 16 patients had PET/CT suggestive of a meningioma that was corroborated on MRI. Of the remaining 13 patients, 11 had a tissue diagnosis confirming a malignancy. Second malignancies included renal cell carcinoma (RCC; 5/11; 45.5%), urothelial carcinoma (<i>n</i> = 2), multiple myeloma, chondrosarcoma, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus and lung (<i>n</i> = 1, each; except for 1 patient with both esophageal and lung carcinomas). Among histopathologically confirmed malignancies, clear-cell RCC had the lowest uptake (SUV<sub>max</sub> 3.4), and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma had the highest uptake (SUV<sub>max</sub> 13.6). Of the 2 patients with no histopathologic confirmation, 1 had ultrasound and MRI findings corroborating the diagnosis of RCC. The other patient had a solitary lung nodule suggestive of primary lung carcinoma and elected to undergo observation. <b>Conclusion:</b> Incidental findings consistent with a second primary neoplasm are not infrequently seen on <sup>18</sup>F-fluciclovine PET/CT performed for assessment of prostate cancer (9.1%). Of the incidentally detected primary cancers, RCC was the most common (45.5%). These findings indicate the need for a careful analysis of <sup>18</sup>F-fluciclovine PET/CT images, due to the broad tumor imaging capabilities of this radiotracer."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms are categorized as neuroendocrine tumors and neuroendocrine carcinomas. Until now, cancer registry reporting of pancreatic cancers does not include a stratification by these two subgroups. We studied the incidence and survival of pancreatic cancer with a special focus on pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms.We analyzed data from the population-based cancer registries of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) and Saarland (SL), Germany, of the years 2009-2018. We included primary malignant pancreatic tumors and report morphology-specific age-standardized (World Standard population) incidence rates for ages 0-79 years and age-standardized relative survival (period approach, ICSS standard). All analyses were restricted to non-death certificate only cases.We analyzed 23,037 patients with a newly diagnosed primary pancreatic cancer. Among morphologically specified cancers, adenocarcinoma (92\u00a0%) and neuroendocrine neoplasms (7\u00a0%) were the most common morphologies. The age-standardized incidence rates of adenocarcinoma, neuroendocrine tumors and neuroendocrine carcinomas were 4.0-5.5 (in NRW and SL), 0.1-0.3, and 0.1-0.3 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. Neuroendocrine tumors had the highest age-standardized 5-year relative survival with 75.5\u00a0% (standard error, SE 2.3) in NRW and 90.6\u00a0% (SE 10.2) in SL followed by neuroendocrine carcinomas (NRW: 30.0\u00a0%, SE 3.1; SL: 32.3\u00a0%, SE 8.7) and adenocarcinomas (NRW: 11.3\u00a0%, SE 0.4; SL: 10.2\u00a0%, SE 1.5).The distinction between neuroendocrine tumors and neuroendocrine carcinomas by the WHO divides neuroendocrine neoplasms into two prognostically clearly distinct subgroups that should be separately analyzed in terms of survival. The first year after diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is the most critical year in terms of survival."

    "content": "The suicide risk after a new cancer diagnosis remains a controversial issue. This study examines the suicide risk within the year after a cancer diagnosis. This is the largest study to assess recent trends in suicide risk after a cancer diagnosis.Data were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. All patients diagnosed with cancer between 2000 and 2014 were selected. The event was defined as death due to suicide within the first year after a cancer diagnosis, and patients who experienced the event after their diagnosis were observed. The observed/expected (O/E) ratio was assessed as well as the excess risk per 10,000 person-years to determine the suicide risk change after the diagnosis in comparison with the general population.A total of 4,671,989 patients with cancer were included; 1585 committed suicide within 1 year of their diagnosis. The risk of suicide increased significantly with an O/E ratio of 2.52 and with an excess risk of 2.51 per 10,000 person-years. When the risk of suicide was studied according to the cancer site, the highest increases in the O/E ratio came after diagnoses of pancreatic cancer (8.01) and lung cancer (6.05). The risk of suicide also increased significantly after a diagnosis of colorectal cancer with an O/E ratio of 2.08. However, the risk of suicidal death did not increase significantly after breast and prostate cancer diagnoses.The risk of suicide increases significantly in the first year after a diagnosis of cancer in comparison with the general population, and this increase varies with the type and prognosis of cancer. Close observation and referral to mental health services, when indicated, are important for mitigating such risk."

    "content": "As public awareness of health has increased and diagnostic and treatment options have improved, the survival of patients with malignant tumors has continued to extend, and the population has been aging, the number of multiple primary malignant neoplasms has gradually increased in recent years. There are few reports concerning female patients with multiple primary malignant neoplasms of breast cancer or genitalia malignancies. In this study, we aimed to analyze the clinical characteristics and prognosis of multiple primary malignant neoplasms in female patients with breast cancer or genitalia malignancies, as well as further explore the factors that affect the survival.We collected clinical data on 80 female patients diagnosed with multiple primary malignant neoplasms of the breast or genitalia, described their clinical features. Furthermore, we calculated the survival and prognostic factors for 52 participants.In our study, the prevalence rate of multiple primary malignant neoplasms was 0.66% (367/55404). Corresponding to female patients with multiple primary malignant neoplasms of breast cancer or genitalia malignancies, it was 1.4% (80/5707). the median age of diagnosis for the first tumor was 48 years, and the median age of diagnosis for the second tumor was 52 years. Regarding the interval, 67.57% (50/74) of patients were within five years. Most tumors were located in the breast (44.68%), followed by the uterus (20.21%), the ovary (17.02%), and the cervix (15.96%). The overall 12-, 36-and 60-month survival rates of the patients were 86.4%, 74.3%, and 69.8%. For the female patients, the stage (III-IV) (<i>P</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.046), non-radical surgery (<i>P</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.002), and types of the last tumor (breast cancer or genitalia malignancies) (<i>P</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.019) were associated with the poor prognosis.Female patients with breast cancer or genital malignancies should pay attention to screening for the second tumor, especially within 4 years after the first tumor diagnosed. Furthermore, during tumor screening, it may be recommended for these patients to focus on colorectal cancer and lung cancer. Compared with previous studies, in addition to clinical staging and types of surgery, we found whether the last tumor was breast cancer or genitalia malignancies should also be considered a prognostic factor."

Cancer registries encode topography and morphology of neoplasms by the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O). ICD-O updates morphology with WHO Classification of Tumors (Blue-Books). Morphological codes of the ICD-O, Blue-Books and SNOMED (former SNOMEDID) have always coincided. In 2017, SCT removed the SNOMEDID.to define neoplastic and topographic subsets in SCT and map them to ICD-O-3.1/Blue-Books; reduce the original number of SCT concepts; correctly identify neoplasms in the laboratories in accordance with international cancer registry rules.SCT neoplastic concepts were identified by manual revision and SCT resources (\"is a\", \"Associated morphology\" relationships; Simple Map Reference Set). Topographic concepts were extracted from the body structure hierarchy of SCT. Both subsets were mapped to ICD-O-3.1/Blue-Books, afterwards. Updating algorithms were designed to automate and update each subset with every SCT release. The process of neoplasms identification was validated in a sample of 5212 specimens with 7378 records from 8 Catalan hospitals.The number of concepts in neoplastic and topographic subsets (16,448 and 32,278) was reduced after the mapping to ICD-O-3.1/Blue-Books (2115 and 330, respectively). Neoplastic subset classified the specimens correctly in the 98.6% of the specimens.This article presents a flexible tool to exhaustively identify neoplasms in pathology laboratories that code with SCT, following international PBCRs standards and in line with the pathologists, oncologists and epidemiologists' needs."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMNs) are associated with significant morbidity and are a major cause of premature mortality among cancer survivors. Several large studies have demonstrated a strong association between the radiation and/or chemotherapy used to treat primary cancer and the risk of developing SMNs. However, for any given therapeutic exposure, the risk of developing an SMN varies between individuals. Genomic variation can potentially modify the association between therapeutic exposures and SMN risk and may explain the observed interindividual variability. In this review, the author provides a brief overview of the current knowledge regarding the role of genomic variation in the development of therapy-related SMNs and discusses the methodological challenges in undertaking an endeavor to develop a deeper understanding of the molecular underpinnings of therapy-related SMNs, such as an appropriate study design, the identification of an adequately sized study population together with a reliable plan for collecting and maintaining high-quality DNA, clinical validation of the phenotype, and the selection of an appropriate approach or platform for genotyping. Understanding the factors that can modify the risk of treatment-related SMNs is critical to developing targeted intervention strategies and optimizing risk-based health care for cancer survivors."

    "content": "Purpose Childhood cancer survivors are at increased risk of subsequent neoplasms (SNs), but the germline genetic contribution is largely unknown. We assessed the contribution of pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) mutations in cancer predisposition genes to their SN risk. Patients and Methods Whole-genome sequencing (30-fold) was performed on samples from childhood cancer survivors who were \u2265 5 years since initial cancer diagnosis and participants in the St Jude Lifetime Cohort Study, a retrospective hospital-based study with prospective clinical follow-up. Germline mutations in 60 genes known to be associated with autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndromes with moderate to high penetrance were classified by their pathogenicity according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines. Relative rates (RRs) and 95% CIs of SN occurrence by mutation status were estimated using multivariable piecewise exponential regression stratified by radiation exposure. Results Participants were 3,006 survivors (53% male; median age, 35.8 years [range, 7.1 to 69.8 years]; 56% received radiotherapy), 1,120 SNs were diagnosed among 439 survivors (14.6%), and 175 P/LP mutations were identified in 5.8% (95% CI, 5.0% to 6.7%) of survivors. Mutations were associated with significantly increased rates of breast cancer (RR, 13.9; 95% CI, 6.0 to 32.2) and sarcoma (RR, 10.6; 95% CI, 4.3 to 26.3) among irradiated survivors and with increased rates of developing any SN (RR, 4.7; 95% CI, 2.4 to 9.3), breast cancer (RR, 7.7; 95% CI, 2.4 to 24.4), nonmelanoma skin cancer (RR, 11.0; 95% CI, 2.9 to 41.4), and two or more histologically distinct SNs (RR, 18.6; 95% CI, 3.5 to 99.3) among nonirradiated survivors. Conclusion The findings support referral of all survivors for genetic counseling for potential clinical genetic testing, which should be prioritized for nonirradiated survivors with any SN and for those with breast cancer or sarcoma in the field of prior irradiation."

Although national deficits have been quantified, a structured response to identifying and addressing local deficits has not been widely available. The objectives of this report are to share preliminary data on monthly screening deficits in breast, colorectal, lung, and cervical cancers across diverse settings and to provide online materials from a national quality improvement (QI) study to help other institutions to address local screening deficits.This prospective, national QI study on Return-to-Screening enrolled 748 accredited cancer programs in the United States from April through June 2021. Local prepandemic and pandemic monthly screening test volumes (MTVs) were used to calculate the relative percent change in MTV to describe the monthly screening gap.The majority of facilities reported monthly screening deficits (colorectal cancer, 80.6% [n = 104/129]; cervical cancer, 69.0% [n = 20/29]; breast cancer, 55.3% [n = 241/436]; lung cancer, 44.6% [n = 98/220]). Overall, the median relative percent change in MTV ranged from -17.7% for colorectal cancer (interquartile range [IQR], -33.6% to -2.8%), -6.8% for cervical cancer (IQR, -29.4% to 1.7%), -1.6% for breast cancer (IQR, -9.6% to 7.0%), and 1.2% for lung cancer (IQR, -16.9% to 19.0%). Geographic differences were not observed. There were statistically significant differences in the percent change in MTV between institution types for colorectal cancer screening (P = .02).Cancer screening is still in need of urgent attention, and the screening resources made available online may help facilities to close critical gaps and address screenings missed in 2020.Question: How can the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on cancer screening be mitigated?When national resources were provided, including methods to calculate local screening deficits, 748 cancer programs promptly enrolled in a national Return-to-Screening study, and the majority identified local screening deficits, most notably in colorectal cancer. Using these results, 814 quality improvement projects were initiated with the potential to add 70,000 screening tests in 2021. Meaning: Cancer screening is still in need of urgent attention, and the online resources that we provide may help to close critical screening deficits."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "<b>Background</b>: We investigate the role of family history of cancer (FHC) and diagnosis of metachronous and/or synchronous multiple neoplasms (MN), during anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. <b>Design</b>: This was a multicenter retrospective study of advanced cancer patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. FHC was collected in lineal and collateral lines, and patients were categorized as follows: FHC-high (in case of cancer diagnoses in both the lineal and collateral family lines), FHC-low (in case of cancer diagnoses in only one family line), and FHC-negative. Patients were also categorized according to the diagnosis of MN as follows: MN-high (>2 malignancies), MN-low (two malignancies), and MN-negative. Objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and incidence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) of any grade were evaluated. <b>Results</b>: 822 consecutive patients were evaluated. 458 patients (55.7%) were FHC-negative, 289 (35.2%) were FHC-low, and 75 (9.1%) FHC-high, respectively. 29 (3.5%) had a diagnosis of synchronous MN and 94 (11.4%) of metachronous MN. 108 (13.2%) and 15 (1.8%) patients were MN-low and MN-high, respectively. The median follow-up was 15.6 months. No significant differences were found regarding ORR among subgroups. FHC-high patients had a significantly longer PFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.69 [95% CI: 0.48-0.97], <i>p</i> = .0379) and OS (HR = 0.61 [95% CI: 0.39-0.93], <i>p</i> = .0210), when compared to FHC-negative patients. FHC-high was confirmed as an independent predictor for PFS and OS at multivariate analysis. No significant differences were found according to MN categories. FHC-high patients had a significantly higher incidence of irAEs of any grade, compared to FHC-negative patients (<i>p</i> = .0012). <b>Conclusions</b>: FHC-high patients seem to benefit more than FHC-negative patients from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Malaria is associated with Burkitt lymphoma among children in Sub-Saharan Africa. No longitudinal studies have assessed the long-term risk of other lymphoma or cancer overall. Here, we investigated the risk of lymphoid neoplasms and other cancer after malaria.We included 4125 patients diagnosed with malaria in Sweden in 1987-2015, identified either through the National Surveillance Database at the Public Health Agency of Sweden, the National Inpatient and Outpatient Register, or by reports from microbiology departments. A comparator cohort (N\u2009=\u200966,997) matched on sex, age and birth region was retrieved from the general population and an additional cohort with all individuals born in Sub-Saharan Africa registered in the Total Population Register in 1987-2015 (N\u2009=\u2009171,756). Incident lymphomas and other cancers were identified through linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register. Hazard ratios (HRs) were assessed using Cox regression with attained age as the timescale.A total of 20 lymphoid neoplasms and 202 non-haematological cancers were identified among malaria patients during a mean follow-up of 13.3 and 13.7\u2009years, respectively. The overall risk of lymphoid neoplasms was not significantly increased (hazard ratio [HR] 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79-1.94), neither did we find any association with all-site non-haematological cancer (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77-1.02). However, in the Sub-Saharan Africa cohort, we observed an increased risk of lymphoid neoplasms after malaria diagnosis (HR 2.39, 95% CI 1.06-5.40), but no difference in the risk of other cancer (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.70-1.45). The association could not be explained by co-infection with HIV or chronic hepatitis B or C, since the risk estimate was largely unchanged after excluding patients with these comorbidities (HR 2.63, 95% CI 1.08-6.42). The risk became more pronounced when restricting analyses to only including non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphomas (HR 3.49, 95% CI 1.42-8.56).Individuals born in malaria-endemic areas and diagnosed with malaria in Sweden had an increased risk of lymphoid neoplasms, especially B cell lymphoma. There was no association with cancer overall nor did single malaria episodes confer an increased risk in travellers."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Cancer survivors receive more long-term opioid therapy (LTOT) than people without cancer, but the safety of LTOT prescribing is unknown.Opioid-naive adults aged \u226566 years who had been diagnosed in 2008-2015 with breast, lung, head and neck, or colorectal cancer were identified with data from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registries linked with Medicare claims. Survivors with 1 or more LTOT episodes (\u226590 consecutive days) occurring \u22651 year after their cancer diagnosis and before censoring at hospice entry, another cancer diagnosis, 6 months before death, or December 2016 were included. The safety of prescribing during the first 90 days of the first LTOT episode was measured during follow-up. As a positive safety indicator, the proportion of survivors with concurrent nonopioid pain management was measured. Indicators of less safe prescribing were the proportion of survivors with a high average daily opioid dose (\u226590 morphine milligram equivalents) and the proportion of survivors with concurrent benzodiazepine dispensing. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify clinical predictors of each safety outcome.In all, 3628 cancer survivors received LTOT during follow-up (median duration, 4.9 months; interquartile range, 3.5-8.0 months). Seventy-two percent of the survivors received multimodal pain management concurrently with LTOT. Eight percent of the survivors had high-dose opioid prescriptions; 25% of the survivors received benzodiazepines during LTOT. Multivariable analyses identified variations in safety measures by multiple clinical factors, although none were consistently significant across outcomes.To improve safe LTOT prescribing for survivors, efforts should focus on increasing multimodal pain management and reducing inappropriate benzodiazepine prescribing. Different clinical predictors of each outcome suggest different drivers of safe prescribing."

    "title": "HRD1 in human malignant neoplasms: Molecular mechanisms and novel therapeutic strategy for cancer.",
    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "In tumor cells, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays an essential role in maintaining cellular proteostasis by stimulating unfolded protein response (UPR) underlying stress conditions. ER-associated degradation (ERAD) is a critical pathway of the UPR to protect cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis and the elimination of unfolded or misfolded proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl reductase degradation (HRD1) as an E3 ubiquitin ligase plays an essential role in the ubiquitination and dislocation of misfolded protein in ERAD. In addition, HRD1 can target other normal folded proteins. In various types of cancer, the expression of HRD1 is dysregulated, and it targets different molecules to develop cancer hallmarks or suppress the progression of the disease. Recent investigations have defined the role of HRD1 in drug resistance in types of cancer. This review focuses on the molecular mechanisms of HRD1 and its roles in cancer pathogenesis and discusses the worthiness of targeting HRD1 as a novel therapeutic strategy in cancer."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Few studies have investigated the risks of subsequent primary neoplasms after adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer. We investigated the risks of specific subsequent primary neoplasms after each of 16 types of AYA cancer.The Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Survivor Study is a population-based cohort of 200\u2008945 survivors of cancer diagnosed when aged 15-39 years in England and Wales from Jan 1, 1971, to Dec 31, 2006. The cohort was established using cancer registrations from the Office for National Statistics and the Welsh Cancer registry. Follow-up was from 5-year survival until the first occurrence of death, emigration, or study end date (Dec 31, 2012). In this analysis, we focus on the risk of specific subsequent primary neoplasms after 16 types of AYA cancer: breast; cervical; testicular; Hodgkin lymphoma (female); Hodgkin lymphoma (male); melanoma; CNS (intracranial); colorectal; non-Hodgkin lymphoma; thyroid; soft-tissue sarcoma; ovarian; bladder; other female genital; leukaemia; and head and neck cancer. We report absolute excess risks (AERs; per 10\u2008000 person-years) and cumulative incidence of specific types of subsequent primary neoplasm after each type of AYA cancer.During the 2\u2008631\u2008326 person-years of follow-up (median follow-up 16\u00b78 years, IQR 10\u00b75-25\u00b72), 12\u2008321 subsequent primary neoplasms were diagnosed in 11\u2008565 survivors, most frequently among survivors of breast cancer, cervical cancer, testicular cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma. AERs of any subsequent primary neoplasms were 19\u00b75 per 10\u2008000 person-years (95% CI 17\u00b74-21\u00b75) in survivors of breast cancer, 10\u00b72 (8\u00b70-12\u00b74) in survivors of cervical cancer, 18\u00b79 (16\u00b76-21\u00b71) in survivors of testicular cancer, 55\u00b77 (50\u00b74-61\u00b71) in female survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, and 29\u00b79 (26\u00b73-33\u00b76) in male survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma. The cumulative incidence of all subsequent primary neoplasms 35 years after diagnosis was 11\u00b79% (95% CI 11\u00b73-12\u00b76) in survivors of breast cancer, 15\u00b78% (14\u00b78-16\u00b77) in survivors of cervical cancer, 20\u00b72% (18\u00b79-21\u00b75) in survivors of testicular cancer, 26\u00b76% (24\u00b77-28\u00b76) in female survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, and 16\u00b75% (15\u00b72-18\u00b70) in male survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma. In patients who had survived at least 30 years from diagnosis of cervical cancer, testicular cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma in women, breast cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma in men, we identified a small number of specific subsequent primary neoplasms that account for 82%, 61%, 58%, 45%, and 41% of the total excess number of neoplasms, respectively. Lung cancer accounted for a notable proportion of the excess number of neoplasms across all AYA groups investigated.Our finding that a small number of specific subsequent primary neoplasms account for a large percentage of the total excess number of neoplasms in long-term survivors of cervical, breast, and testicular cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma provides an evidence base to inform priorities for clinical long-term follow-up. The prominence of lung cancer after each of these AYA cancers indicates the need for further work aimed at preventing and reducing the burden of this cancer in future survivors of AYA cancer.Cancer Research UK, National Institute for Health Research, Academy of Medical Sciences, and Children with Cancer UK."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "The majority of JAK2<sup>V617F</sup>-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) have disease-initiating frameshift mutations in calreticulin (<i>CALR</i>), resulting in a common carboxyl-terminal mutant fragment (CALR<sup>MUT</sup>), representing an attractive source of neoantigens for cancer vaccines. However, studies have shown that CALR<sup>MUT</sup>-specific T cells are rare in patients with CALR<sup>MUT</sup> MPN for unknown reasons. We examined class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I) allele frequencies in patients with CALR<sup>MUT</sup> MPN from two independent cohorts. We observed that MHC-I alleles that present CALR<sup>MUT</sup> neoepitopes with high affinity are underrepresented in patients with CALR<sup>MUT</sup> MPN. We speculated that this was due to an increased chance of immune-mediated tumor rejection by individuals expressing one of these MHC-I alleles such that the disease never clinically manifested. As a consequence of this MHC-I allele restriction, we reasoned that patients with CALR<sup>MUT</sup> MPN would not efficiently respond to a CALR<sup>MUT</sup> fragment cancer vaccine but would when immunized with a modified CALR<sup>MUT</sup> heteroclitic peptide vaccine approach. We found that heteroclitic CALR<sup>MUT</sup> peptides specifically designed for the MHC-I alleles of patients with CALR<sup>MUT</sup> MPN efficiently elicited a CALR<sup>MUT</sup> cross-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response in human peripheral blood samples but not to the matched weakly immunogenic CALR<sup>MUT</sup> native peptides. We corroborated this effect in vivo in mice and observed that C57BL/6J mice can mount a CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response to the CALR<sup>MUT</sup> fragment upon immunization with a CALR<sup>MUT</sup> heteroclitic, but not native, peptide. Together, our data emphasize the therapeutic potential of heteroclitic peptide-based cancer vaccines in patients with CALR<sup>MUT</sup> MPN."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Health outcomes of children in families affected by cancer are poorly understood. The authors assessed the risk of hospitalization in children who have a sibling with cancer.This was a longitudinal cohort study in which 1600 children who had a sibling with cancer were matched to 32,000 children who had unaffected siblings in Quebec, Canada, from 2006 to 2020. The exposure of interest was having a sibling with cancer. Outcomes included hospitalization for pneumonia, asthma, fracture, and other morbidities any time after the sibling was diagnosed with cancer. The children were followed over time, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the impact of having a sibling with cancer on the risk of hospitalization before age 14 years, adjusted for patient characteristics.Children who had a sibling with cancer had an increased risk of hospitalization compared with unaffected children (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.29). Conditions associated with a greater risk of hospitalization included pneumonia, hemangioma, other skin conditions, sleep apnea, and inflammatory bowel disease. The risk of hospitalization was greatest for children whose older sibling had cancer (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.01-1.32) and for children whose sibling had hematopoietic cancer (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.01-1.48).Children who have a sibling with cancer are at risk of hospitalization for conditions such as pneumonia, inflammatory bowel disease, and other morbidities. Families affected by childhood cancer may benefit from additional support to facilitate care for all children in the family.Little is known about the health of children who have a brother or sister with cancer. The authors studied the types of hospitalization experienced by children who have siblings with cancer. The results indicated that having a sibling with cancer increased the chance of being hospitalized for pneumonia and other conditions that could have been preventable. The results also indicated that children who had an older sibling with cancer or a sibling with blood cancer had a greater chance of being hospitalized. The findings highlight the importance of providing timely care for children in families affected by childhood cancer."

    "content": "The Childhood Cancer Research Network (CCRN) was established by the Children's Oncology Group (COG) as a resource for epidemiologic studies of childhood cancer. The objective of this study was to evaluate the representativeness of CCRN and identify factors associated with enrollment.The number of US childhood patients with cancer diagnosed <20 years of age enrolled in CCRN (2008-2015) was compared to expected counts, calculated from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results incidence rates and US Census population estimates. Observed-to-expected ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated across sex, race, diagnosis age, calendar year, and cancer diagnosis groups. Multivariable linear regression models were generated to evaluate the association between open COG phase 3 therapeutic trials and CCRN enrollment rates.The 43,110 cases enrolled in CCRN represented 36% of the expected childhood cancers diagnosed from 2008 to 2015 (N = 120,118). CCRN enrollment ratios [95% CI] were highest among males (0.38 [95% CI, 0.37-0.38]), non-Hispanics (0.35 [95% CI, 0.35-0.36]), and those diagnosed from 1 to 4 years of age (0.50 [95% CI, 0.50-51]). Enrollment ratios varied by diagnosis group, with leukemia, myeloproliferative diseases, myelodysplastic diseases (0.55 [95% CI, 0.54-0.55]), and renal tumors (0.55 [95% CI, 0.53-0.58]) having the highest enrollment. After adjusting for year of diagnosis and cancer diagnosis, there was a 3.1% [95% CI, 0.6-5.6%] increase in CCRN enrollment during windows of open COG therapeutic trials.Despite enrolling only 36% of newly diagnosed cases, CCRN remains a valuable resource for investigators conducting childhood cancer etiology and survivorship research. The results of this study may inform efforts to improve enrollment on current and future COG nontherapeutic registry protocols."

Bootstrapping approach and competing-risk proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the effect of RT on nonbreast SMN risk. The analysis was repeated in racial subgroups. Radiotolerance score analysis of normal airway epithelium was performed using Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data sets.Within records of 30,003 women with primary breast cancer, 20,516 eligible patients were identified, including 2,183 African Americans (AAs) and 16,009 Caucasians. The 25-year cumulative incidences of SMN were 5.2% and 3.6% (RT vs no-RT) for AAs, with 12.8-year and 17.4-year (RT vs no-RT) median follow-up (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.81; 95% bootstrapping confidence interval [BCI], 1.02-2.50; P < .05), respectively, and 6.4% and 5.9% (RT vs no-RT) for Caucasians with 14.3-year and\u00a018.1-year (RT vs no-RT) median follow-up (HR = 1.10; 95% BCI, 0.61-1.40; P > .05), respectively. The largest portion of excess RT-related SMN risk was lung cancer (AA: HR = 2.08, 95% BCI, 1.02-5.39, P < .05; Caucasian: HR = 1.50, 95% BCI, 0.84-5.38, P > .05). Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plot (STEPP) analysis revealed higher\u00a0post-RT nonbreast SMN risk in those 20 to 44 years of age, with larger HRs for RT in AAs. Radiotolerance score (RTS) of normal airway epithelium from young AA women was significantly lower than that from young Caucasian women (P = .038).With a projected 25-year follow-up, RT is associated with elevated risk of nonbreast SMNs, particularly second lung cancer, in young women survivors of stage I-IIIA breast cancer. Nonbreast SMNs associated with RT are higher in AA women than Caucasian women."

    "content": "This study evaluated the association between preexisting stress-related diagnoses and mortality in a Danish population-based cancer cohort.This study included Danish patients with cancer diagnosed in 1995-2011 who had a stress-related diagnosis before their cancer diagnosis. Cancer patients without a prior stress-related diagnosis were matched 5:1 to the stress disorder cohort by cancer site, age group, calendar period, and sex. The 5-year cumulative incidence of cancer-specific and all-cause mortality was computed by stress-related diagnosis category. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) associating stress-related diagnoses with mortality were computed by follow-up time, stress-related diagnosis category, stage, comorbidity status, and cancer type.This study identified 4437 cancer patients with a preexisting stress-related diagnosis and 22,060 matched cancer cohort members. The 5-year cumulative risk of cancer-specific mortality was 33% (95% CI, 32%-35%) for those with a preexisting stress-related diagnosis and 29% (95% CI, 28%-29%) for those without a prior stress-related diagnosis. Cancer patients with a preexisting stress-related diagnosis had a 1.3 times higher cancer-specific mortality rate than the comparison cohort members (95% CI, 1.2-1.5). This increase persisted across categories of stress-related diagnosis. The association varied by stage and cancer type, with more pronounced associations found among those with a late stage at diagnosis and hematological malignancies.Cancer patients with preexisting stress-related diagnoses had increased rates of cancer-specific and all-cause mortality. The results suggest that psychiatric comorbidities may be an important consideration for cancer prognosis, and cancer treatment informed by a patient's history may improve outcomes."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Cancer prevalence is heterogeneous because it includes individuals who are undergoing initial treatment and those who are in remission, experiencing relapse, or cured. The proposed statistical approach describes the health status of this group by estimating the probabilities of death among prevalent cases. The application concerns colorectal, lung, breast, and prostate cancers and melanoma in France in 2017.Excess mortality was used to estimate the probabilities of death from cancer and other causes.For the studied cancers, most deaths from cancer occurred during the first 5\u2009years after diagnosis. The probability of death from cancer decreased with increasing time since diagnosis except for breast cancer, for which it remained relatively stable. The time beyond which the probability of death from cancer became lower than that from other causes depended on age and cancer site: for colorectal cancer, it was 6\u2009years after diagnosis for women (7\u2009years for men) aged 75-84 and 20\u2009years for women (18\u2009years for men) aged 45-54\u2009years, whereas cancer was the major cause of death for women younger than 75\u2009years whatever the time since diagnosis for breast and for all patients younger than 75\u2009years for lung cancer. In contrast, deaths from other causes were more frequent in all the patients older than 75\u2009years. Apart from breast cancer in women younger than 55\u2009years and lung cancer in women older than 55\u2009years and men older than 65\u2009years, the probability of death from cancer among prevalent cases fell below 1%, with varying times since diagnosis.The authors' approach can be used to better describe the burden of cancer by estimating outcomes in prevalent cases."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Cancer-related fatigue is a debilitating late effect after treatment for childhood cancer. The prevalence of fatigue in childhood cancer survivors (CCSs) and associated factors for fatigue has varied widely in previous studies. Two important aspects of cancer-related fatigue, its severity and chronicity, are often not assessed. This study investigated the prevalence of, and risk factors for, severe chronic fatigue (CF) in a national cohort of Dutch CCSs.In this study, 2810 CCSs (5-year survivors of all childhood malignancies diagnosed between 1963 and 2001 with a current age of 12-65 years) and 1040 sibling controls were included. CF was assessed with the Short Fatigue Questionnaire and was defined as a score \u2265 18 and persistence of fatigue for \u22656 months. Cancer- and treatment-related characteristics, current health problems, and demographic and lifestyle variables were assessed as potential risk factors for CF via multivariable logistic regression analyses.In adult CCSs and sibling controls (\u226518 years old), the prevalence of CF was 26.1% and 14.1%, respectively (P < .001). In adolescent CCSs and sibling controls (<18 years old), the prevalence of CF was 10.9% and 3.2%, respectively. Female gender (odds ratio [OR], 2.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.73-2.62), unemployment (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.67-2.85), having 1 or more health problems (OR for 1-2, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.18-1.87; OR for >2, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.50-3.21), and a central nervous system diagnosis (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.17-2.60) were significantly associated with CF in adult CCSs.This study shows that CCSs, regardless of their cancer diagnosis, report CF more often than sibling controls. This study provides new evidence for the prevalence of fatigue in CCSs."

NCI-designated centers were more likely than nondesignated centers to have a PC fellowship program (87% vs 30%; P < .001), training for advanced practice providers (71% vs 44%; P = .03), PC research program (58% vs 15%; P < .001), peer-reviewed funding (43% vs 11%; P = .005), and philanthropic grants (41% vs 7%; P = .002). There were few significant improvements in PC education or research between 2009 and 2018 for both groups, notable exceptions include an increase in PC fellowships (38% vs 87%; P < .001) and mandatory PC rotations for medical oncology fellows (29% vs 55%; P = .02) at NCI-designated cancer centers.PC education and research are more developed at NCI-designated cancer centers. Despite some progress over the past decade, it is relatively slow and suboptimal."

    "content": "Biobanks constitute an integral part of precision medicine. They provide a repository of biospecimens that may be used to elucidate the pathophysiology, support diagnoses, and guide the treatment of diseases. The pilot biobank of rare malignant neoplasms has been established in the context of the Hellenic Network of Precision Medicine on Cancer and aims to enhance future clinical and/or research studies in Greece by collecting, processing, and storing rare malignant neoplasm samples with associated data. The biobank currently comprises 553\u00a0samples; 384\u00a0samples of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissue malignancies, 72\u00a0samples of pediatric brain tumors and 97\u00a0samples of malignant skin neoplasms. In this article, sample collections and their individual significance in clinical research are described in detail along with computational methods developed specifically for this project. A concise review of the Greek biobanking landscape is also delineated, in addition to recommended technologies, methodologies and protocols that were integrated during the creation of the biobank. This project is expected to re\u2011enforce current clinical and research studies, introduce advances in clinical and genetic research and potentially aid in future targeted drug discovery. It is our belief that the future of medical research is entwined with accessible, effective, and ethical biobanking and that our project will facilitate research planning in the '\u2011omic' era by contributing high\u2011quality samples along with their associated data."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Cardiometabolic abnormalities are a leading cause of death among women, including women with cancer.This study examined the association between prediagnosis cardiovascular health and total and cause-specific mortality among 12,076 postmenopausal women who developed local- or regional-stage invasive cancer in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). Cardiovascular risk factors included waist circumference, hypertension, high cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes. Obesity-related cancers included breast cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, kidney cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for important predictors of survival.After a median follow-up of 10.0 years from the date of the cancer diagnosis, there were 3607 total deaths, with 1546 (43%) due to cancer. Most participants (62.9%) had 1 or 2 cardiometabolic risk factors, and 8.1% had 3 or 4. In adjusted models, women with 3 to 4 risk factors (vs none) had a higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.73-2.30), death due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) (HR, 4.01; 95% CI, 2.88-5.57), cancer-specific mortality (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.1-1.72), and other-cause mortality (HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.70-2.69). A higher waist circumference was associated with greater all-cause mortality (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.06-1.30) and cancer-specific mortality (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.04-1.42).Among postmenopausal women diagnosed with cancer in the WHI, cardiometabolic risk factors before the cancer diagnosis were associated with greater all-cause, CVD, cancer-specific, and other-cause mortality. These results raise hypotheses regarding potential clinical intervention strategies targeting cardiometabolic abnormalities that require future prospective studies for confirmation.This study uses information from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) to find out whether cardiac risk factors are related to a greater risk of dying among older women with cancer. The WHI is the largest study of medical problems faced by older women in this country. The results show that women who have 3 or 4 risk factors are more likely to die of any cause, heart disease, or cancer in comparison with women with no risk factors. It is concluded that interventions to help to lower the burden of cardiac risk factors can have an important impact on survivorship among women with cancer."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "<b>Purpose:</b> Second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) are severe late complications that occur in pediatric cancer survivors exposed to radiotherapy and other genotoxic treatments. To characterize the mutational landscape of treatment-induced sarcomas and to identify candidate SMN-predisposing variants, we analyzed germline and SMN samples from pediatric cancer survivors.<b>Experimental Design:</b> We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing on radiation-induced sarcomas arising from two pediatric cancer survivors. To assess the frequency of germline <i>TP53</i> variants in SMNs, Sanger sequencing was performed to analyze germline <i>TP53</i> in 37 pediatric cancer survivors from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) without any history of a familial cancer predisposition syndrome but known to have developed SMNs.<b>Results:</b> WES revealed <i>TP53</i> mutations involving p53's DNA-binding domain in both index cases, one of which was also present in the germline. The germline and somatic <i>TP53-</i>mutant variants were enriched in the transcriptomes for both sarcomas. Analysis of <i>TP53-</i>coding exons in germline specimens from the CCSS survivor cohort identified a G215C variant encoding an R72P amino acid substitution in 6 patients and a synonymous SNP A639G in 4 others, resulting in 10 of 37 evaluable patients (27%) harboring a germline <i>TP53</i> variant.<b>Conclusions:</b> Currently, germline <i>TP53</i> is not routinely assessed in patients with pediatric cancer. These data support the concept that identifying germline <i>TP53</i> variants at the time a primary cancer is diagnosed may identify patients at high risk for SMN development, who could benefit from modified therapeutic strategies and/or intensive posttreatment monitoring. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 23(7); 1852-61. \u00a92016 AACR</i>."

    "content": "Assessing quality of life is essential for individuals with advanced cancer, but lengthy assessments can be burdensome. The authors investigated the psychometric characteristics of the FACT-G7, a 7-item quality-of-life measure derived from the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) scale, in advanced cancer.Data were obtained from outpatients with advanced cancer who were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of early palliative care. At baseline, 228 intervention participants and 233 control participants (N\u00a0=\u00a0461) completed the FACT-G and measures of symptom severity, quality of life near the end of life, problematic medical communication, and satisfaction with care. Follow-up measures were administered monthly for 4\u00a0months.The FACT-G7 showed good internal consistency (Cronbach \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a0.72-.80), and its single-factor structure was supported. It correlated strongly with the FACT-G total, physical, and functional indices and with symptom severity (absolute r\u00a0=\u00a00.73-0.92); more moderately with the FACT-G emotional index and with symptom impact and preparation for the end of life (r\u00a0=\u00a0.40-.71); and least with the FACT-G social/family index and with relationship with health care provider, life completion, problematic medical communication, and care satisfaction measures (absolute r\u00a0=\u00a0.26-.44). Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status groups differed on FACT-G7 scores, as expected (all P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Improvements in FACT-G7 scores in the intervention group compared with the control group at 3-month (P\u00a0=\u00a0.049) and 4-month (P\u00a0=\u00a0.034) follow-up supported responsiveness to change and somewhat greater sensitivity than the FACT-G scores.The FACT-G7 is a valid, brief measure particularly of the physical and functional facets of quality of life. It may enable rapid quality-of-life assessments in patients with advanced cancer."

    "content": "Cancer survivors face psychosocial issues that increase their risk of suicide. This study examined the risk of suicide across cancer sites, with a focus on survivors of head and neck cancer (HNC).The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 18-registry database (from 2000 to 2014) was queried for the top 20 cancer sites in the database, including HNC. The outcome of interest was suicide as a cause of death. The mortality rate from suicide was estimated for HNC sites and was compared with rates for 19 other cancer sites that were included in the study. Poisson regression was used to estimate adjusted rate ratios (aRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 1) HNC versus non-HNC sites (the other 19 cancer sites combined), and 2) HNC versus each individual cancer site. Models were stratified by sex, controlling for race, marital status, age, year, and stage at diagnosis.There were 404 suicides among 151,167 HNC survivors from 2000 to 2014, yielding a suicide rate of 63.4 suicides per 100,000 person-years. In this timeframe, there were 4493 suicides observed among 4219,097 cancer survivors in the study sample, yielding an incidence rate of 23.6 suicides per 100,000 person-years. Compared with survivors of other cancers, survivors of HNC were almost 2 times more likely to die from suicide (aRR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.77-2.19). There was a 27% increase in the risk of suicide among HNC survivors during the period from 2010 to 2014 (aRR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.16-1.38) compared with the period from 2000 to 2004.Although survival rates in cancer have improved because of improved treatments, the risk of death by suicide remains a problem for cancer survivors, particularly those with HNC."

    "content": "Five-year relative survival for adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with cancer diagnosed at the ages of 15 to 39 years is 85%. Survival rates vary considerably according to the cancer type. The purpose of this study was to analyze long-term survival trends for cancer types with the highest mortality among AYAs to determine where the greatest burden is and to identify areas for future research.Using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry and the National Center for Health Statistics, the authors examined the incidence, mortality, and survival for the 9 cancer types with the highest mortality rates in this age group from 1975 to 2016. JPSurv, new survival trend software, was used in the analysis.Results suggested significant improvements in 5-year relative survival for brain and other nervous system tumors, colon and rectum cancer, lung and bronchus cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (all P values < .05). Limited or no improvement in survival was found for female breast cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, and bone and joint sarcomas.Five-year relative survival for multiple cancer types in AYAs has improved, but some common cancer types in this group still show limited survival improvements (eg, ovarian cancer). Survival improvements in colorectal cancer have been overshadowed by its rising incidence, which suggests a substantial disease burden. Future research should focus on female breast, bone, ovarian, and cervical cancers, which have seen minimal or no improvements in survival.Survival trends for adolescents and young adults with cancer are presented from a 40-year period. Although survival progress is noted for brain cancer, lung cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and colon and rectum cancer, the incidence of colon and rectum cancer remains high. Minimal progress is evident for female breast, bone, ovarian, and cervical cancers, which are in need of renewed focus."

It is not clear whether patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), which are precursors to some pancreatic cancers, also carry these mutations. We assessed the prevalence of germline mutations associated with cancer risk in patients with histologically confirmed IPMN.We obtained nontumor tissue samples from 315 patients with surgically resected IPMNs from 1997 through 2017, and we sequenced 94 genes with variants associated with cancer risk. Mutations associated with increased risk of cancer were identified and compared with individuals from the Exome Aggregation Consortium.We identified 23 patients with a germline mutation associated with cancer risk (7.3%; 95% confidence interval, 4.9-10.8). Nine patients had a germline mutation associated with pancreatic cancer susceptibility (2.9%; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-5.4). More patients with IPMNs carried germline mutations in ATM (P < .0001), PTCH1 (P < .0001), and SUFU (P < .0001) compared with controls. Patients with IPMNs and germline mutations associated with pancreatic cancer were more like to have concurrent invasive pancreatic carcinoma compared with patients with IPMNs without these mutations (P < .0320).In sequence analyses of 315 patients with surgically resected IPMNs, we found that almost 3% to carry mutations associated with pancreatic cancer risk. More patients with IPMNs and germline mutations associated with pancreatic cancer had concurrent invasive pancreatic carcinoma compared with patients with IPMNs without these mutations. Genetic analysis of patients with IPMNs might identify those at greatest risk for cancer."

This study assessed MH service use and unmet service needs among a nationally representative sample of cancer survivors.Respondents aged 18 to 64\u00a0years were identified from the 2015-2018 National Survey of Drug Use and Health data. Outcomes assessed past-year MH service use and self-reported unmet MH needs. Outcomes were compared between respondents who reported a cancer history (survivors) and those who did not (controls), descriptively and in adjusted analyses controlling for sociodemographic factors and health status. Analyses were stratified by age groups (18-34, 35-49, and 50-64\u00a0years).Comparing 3540 survivors with 149,843 controls, within each age group, a higher proportion of survivors than controls received any MH service (P values\u00a0<\u00a0.05); this difference persisted among those aged 35 to 49\u00a0years (P\u00a0=\u00a0.004) in fully adjusted models. Moreover, a higher proportion of survivors than controls reported an unmet need for MH care; this difference was larger among young adults aged 18 to 34\u00a0years (20.8% vs 9.0%; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) than those aged 35 to 49\u00a0years (9.4% vs 5.3%; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and 50 to 64\u00a0years (4.8% vs 3.4%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.029). In fully adjusted models, the survivor-control difference in self-reported unmet MH needs persisted among young adults (24% relative increase; P\u00a0=\u00a0.023). Among cancer survivors, young adult survivors had the highest likelihood of reporting unmet MH needs.This nationally representative study found an increased perception of unmet needs for MH care among cancer survivors, particularly among young adult survivors, compared with the general population without cancer."

    "content": "Curative therapy places childhood cancer survivors at increased risk for second primary malignancies (SPMs). However, there have been few population-based attempts to characterize differences between outcomes of SPMs in childhood cancer survivors and outcomes of first primary malignancies (FPMs).Clinical and demographic information about childhood cancer survivors who developed SPMs and individuals with comparable FPMs was extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated with Cox proportional hazards models comparing the overall survival (OS) of individuals with and without a history of childhood cancer. OS was evaluated both overall and for specific cancers diagnosed in 50 or more childhood cancer survivors. Models accounted for potential confounders, including sex, race, age, treatment decade, histology, and disease stage.Compared with individuals with FPMs (n\u00a0=\u00a01,332,203), childhood cancer survivors (n\u00a0=\u00a01409) with an SPM experienced poorer OS (HR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.72-2.02) after the study had accounted for cancer type, age, sex, race, and decade of diagnosis. A history of childhood cancer remained a poor prognostic factor for all specific cancers evaluated, including breast cancer (HR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.63-2.62), thyroid cancer (HR, 3.59; 95% CI, 2.08-6.19), acute myeloid leukemia (HR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.87-3.05), brain cancer (HR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.72-2.55), melanoma (HR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.55-4.27), bone cancer (HR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.37-2.57), and soft-tissue sarcoma (HR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.78-3.33).Compared with individuals without a prior cancer diagnosis, survivors of childhood cancer with an SPM experienced inferior outcomes.

The relative risk of death after a pediatric cancer diagnosis versus the general population and the risk of death from a primary cancer diagnosis versus competing causes of death.This retrospective, population-based study used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (1980-2015) and included patients aged 0 to 19\u00a0years at the time of diagnosis. Observed deaths were calculated; the risk of death versus the general population was assessed with standardized mortality ratios (SMRs). Competing risk models for the cause of death were performed.There were 58,356 patients who were diagnosed, and the mortality rate was 22.8%. To assess causes of death, 6996 patients who died during the study period were included (45,580 total person-years at risk): 5128 (73%) died of their primary cancer, and 1868 (27%) died of a competing cause. Among all patients, the rate of death from the index cancer was higher than the rate of death from another cause within the first 5\u00a0years after diagnosis. The risk of death from a nonprimary cancer began to supersede the rate of death from the primary cancer 10\u00a0years after diagnosis for patients with germ cell tumors, lymphomas, and sarcomas. SMRs for the primary cancer were highest within the first 5\u00a0years after diagnosis for all cancers (SMRs, 100-50,000; P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). The risk of death from competing causes (heart disease, suicide, and sepsis) was elevated (SMR, >100; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). The risk of dying of heart disease was high, especially for patients with astrocytomas (SMR, 47.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 27.87-76.59) and neuroblastomas (SMR, 98.59; 95% CI, 47.28-181.32).

The objective of this study was to assess substance use, misuse, and substance use disorders [SUDs], as well as receipt of treatment for SUDs, among AYA cancer survivors.The authors used data from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health (2015-2018) to identify a nationally representative sample of AYAs aged 12 to 34 years. Outcomes assessed past-year tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and illicit drug use; misuse of prescription opioids; SUDs; and SUD treatment. Multiple logistic regression was estimated to compare outcomes between 832 AYAs who reported a cancer history (survivors) and 140,826 AYAs who did not, adjusting sequentially for sociodemographic characteristics and health status.In regressions adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, survivors were more likely than a noncancer comparison group of peers to use alcohol (6% relative increase; P = .048) and illicit drugs (34% relative increase; P = .012), to misuse prescription opioids (59% relative increase; P < .001), and to have a marijuana (67% relative increase; P = .011), illicit drug (77% relative increase; P < .001), or prescription opioid (67% relative increase; P = .048) SUD. When further adjusting for health status, survivors were still 41% more likely (P < .001) to misuse prescription opioids than noncancer peers. Among those with SUDs, survivors were more likely than peers to receive treatment (unadjusted, 21.5% vs 8.0%; adjusted, P < .05).AYA survivors were as likely as or more likely than noncancer peers to report substance use problems. These findings underscore the importance of interventions to reduce substance use and improve SUD treatment among AYA cancer survivors.The authors assessed substance use, misuse, and substance use disorders, as well as the receipt of treatment for substance use disorders, among adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors. In a nationally representative AYA sample, cancer survivors, despite their increased risk for morbidity and early mortality, were as likely as or more likely than peers without cancer to experience substance use problems. In particular, survivors had a significantly higher rate of prescription opioid misuse than peers. However, only 1 in 5 AYA survivors who experienced substance use disorders received treatment.

Little is known about the experiences of patients with advanced cancer using opioids in the context of the epidemic.Semistructured interviews of 26 patients with advanced cancer were conducted between May 2019 and April 2020; their experiences self-managing chronic pain with opioids were evaluated.Patients consistently described the negative impact of the opioid epidemic on their ability to self-manage pain. Negative media coverage and personal experiences with the epidemic promoted stigma, fear, and guilt surrounding opioid use. As a result, many patients delayed initiating opioids and often viewed their decision to take opioids as a moral failure-as \"caving in.\" Patients frequently managed this internal conflict through opioid-restricting behaviors (eg, skipping or taking lower doses). Stigma also impeded patient-clinician communication; patients often avoided discussing opioids or purposely conveyed underusing them to avoid being labeled a \"pill seeker.\" Patients experienced structural barriers to obtaining opioids such as prior authorizations, delays in refills, or being questioned by pharmacists about their opioid use. Barriers were stressful, amplified stigma, interfered with pain control, and reinforced ambivalence about opioids.The US opioid epidemic has stigmatized opioid use and undermined pain management in individuals with advanced cancer. Interventions seeking to alleviate cancer pain should attend to the multiple, negative influences of the opioid crisis on patients' ability to self-manage.Patients with advanced cancer suffer from significant pain and frequently receive opioids to manage their pain. Of the 26 patients with advanced cancer interviewed, the majority of patients experienced stigma about their opioid use for cancer pain management. All patients felt that the opioid epidemic fostered this stigma. Several struggled to use opioids for pain because of this stigma and the logistical complications they experienced with pharmacies and insurance coverage. Many were afraid to share their concerns about opioids with their providers. \u200b."

A Cox proportional hazards model was used, with the time at risk of cancer development starting on either January 1, 1960, or the date of immigration to the date of cancer diagnosis or death or the date of last follow-up (December 31, 2006).Cancer was diagnosed in 22.2% of those who were granted compensation versus 16% of those who were denied compensation (P < .0001). Adjusting for birth cohort, sex, country of origin, and period of immigration, both analyses revealed significant increased risks of developing cancer in those who were exposed. For those who were granted versus denied compensation, the hazard ratios were 1.06 (P < .001) for all sites, 1.12 (P = .07) for colorectal cancer, and 1.37 (P = .008) for lung cancer. For those born in occupied countries versus nonoccupied countries, the hazard ratios were 1.08 (P < .001), 1.08 (P = .003), and 1.12 (P = .02), respectively.The current results, based on a large cohort of Holocaust survivors who were exposed to a variety of severe deprivations, add to the conflicting and sparse knowledge on this issue and support the notion that this group has a small but consistent increase in cancer development.

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic may induce post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among patients with cancer, who also face adaptations to their treatment. The authors assessed the occurrence of PTSD symptoms, investigated pandemic-induced adjustments in medical oncology practice in patients with cancer, and explored risk factors for PTSD and the association between PTSD symptoms, insomnia, and quality of life (QoL).This prospective French study was conducted in patients with solid/hematologic tumors who were receiving medical treatment in the day care departments of 2 cancer centers during the lockdown. Adjustments to medical oncology practice were collected from medical records. PTSD (measured using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised), insomnia (measured using the Insomnia Severity Index), QoL (measured using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General instrument), and cognitive complaints (measured using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function instrument) were collected through validated questionnaires.Clinical data and questionnaires were available for 734 and 576 patients, respectively. The median patient age was 64\u00a0years, and 69% of patients were women. Twenty-one percent of patients had PTSD. Twenty-seven percent (95% CI, 23%-30%) had an adjustment in their medical oncology program, including adjournments (29%), treatment interruptions (16%), modified treatment plans (27%), or adapted monitoring (27%). Women and patients experiencing an adjustment in oncology practice had a higher odds of PTSD (odds ratio= 2.10 [95% CI, 1.07-4.14] and 1.65 [95% CI, 1.03-2.63]; P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). PTSD symptoms were correlated with worse scores for QoL, cognition, and insomnia.Twenty-one percent of patients with cancer experienced PTSD symptoms associated with poor QoL during the first COVID-19-induced lockdown. Medical oncology practice was adjusted in approximately one-quarter of patients and was associated with the occurrence of PTSD symptoms. Psychosocial support should be offered in cancer centers to promote emotional resilience and avoid PTSD symptoms in patients."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Retrospective analysis of data from 14,528 lung cancer patients with multiple primary malignant neoplasm (MPMN) revealed that 2.5% (364/14,528) were MPMN cases and 96.2% (350/364) were diagnosed with two primary malignancies, 3.6% (13/364) with three primary malignancies, and 0.3% (1/364) with four primary malignancies. Among 350 lung cancer patients diagnosed with two primary malignancies, 26.6% (93/350) had lung cancer diagnosed first (LCF) and 73.4% (257/350) had other cancers diagnosed initially (OCF), whereas synchronous MPMN (SMPMN) accounted for 21.1% (74/350) and metachronous MPMN (MMPMN) accounted for 78.9% (276/350) of the cases. Detection of first primary neoplasms were at an early stage for LCF patients and the age of the first lung cancer diagnosis was 59.3 years vs. 55.4 years in the OCF group (P\u2009=\u20090.008), whereas the onset age of second primary neoplasm diagnosis was similar in both groups (62.5 and 61.6 years, P\u2009=\u20090.544). Median survival times of MMPMN and SMPMN patients in the LCF group were 6.83 and 2.42 years and in the OCF group 8.67 years and 2.25 years, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that SMPMN, LCF and the age of the primary cancer diagnosed first (\u2009\u2265\u200960 years) and NSCL staging\u2009 >\u2009II were significant independent factors for inferior prognosis of patients."

    "content": "Adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with cancer have not seen the same improvements in survival as younger (pediatric) patients and older patients (adults 40 years old or older). This may be related to their lower participation in clinical trials.This study examined AYA patient accrual to SWOG Cancer Research Network phase 1 to 3 clinical treatment trials for 29 cancers over 25 years (January 1996 to December 2020). Trial enrollments for AYA patients (15-39 years old) were compared with trial enrollments for older patients (40 years old or older) in SWOG and with US AYA cancer population rates derived from US Census and National Cancer Institute/Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data.In total, 84,219 patients were enrolled in SWOG treatment trials, including 7109 AYA patients (8.4%); in contrast, AYAs constituted 3.8% of the US cancer population. By histology, the highest proportions of AYA patients were in trials for Hodgkin disease (825 of 1220; 67.6%) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (350 of 678; 51.6%), whereas breast cancer trials had the greatest number of AYA patients (3032 of 32,693; 9.3%). SWOG AYA patients were more often female (68.8% vs 58.7%; P < .001), Black (10.1% vs 8.2%; P < .001), and Hispanic (10.6% vs 5.6%; P < .001) than SWOG patients who were 40 years old or older, and they were more often female (68.8% vs 65.1%; P < .001) but less often Black (10.1% vs 11.8%; P < .001) or Hispanic (10.6% vs 12.8%; P < .001) than AYA patients in the US cancer population.AYA patients with cancer were well represented in SWOG clinical trials in comparison with US cancer population patients with the same cancers. The SWOG AYA population was more racially/ethnically diverse than older SWOG patients, although it was less diverse than the US AYA cancer population.Adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with cancer (aged 15-39 years) have not seen the same improvements in survival as younger (pediatric) patients and older patients (adults 40 years old or older). This may be related to their lower participation in clinical trials. This study evaluated the extent to which AYA patients were enrolled in a large, National Cancer Institute-sponsored network group over 25 years (1996-2020). Overall, 8.4% of the enrolled patients (7109 of 84,219) were AYAs; this was twice the corresponding rate of 3.8% in the US cancer population. AYA patients were also more racially/ethnically diverse than older trial patients, although they were less racially/ethnically diverse than the US AYA cancer population."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "The risk of developing a solid cancer is a major issue arising in the disease course of a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). Although the connection between the two diseases has been widely described, the backstage of this complex scenario has still to be explored. Several cellular and molecular mechanisms have been suggested to link the two tumors. Sometimes the MPN is considered to trigger a second cancer but at other times both diseases seem to depend on the same source. Increasing knowledge in recent years has revealed emerging pathways, supporting older, more consolidated theories, but there are still many unresolved issues. Our work aims to present the biological face of the complex clinical scenario in MPN patients developing a second cancer, focusing on the main cellular and molecular pathways linking the two diseases."

    "content": "The comparative risks of a second cancer diagnosis are uncertain after primary cancer treatment with 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT), intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), or proton beam radiotherapy (PBRT).Pediatric and adult patients with a first cancer diagnosis between 2004 and 2015 who received 3DCRT, IMRT, or PBRT were identified in the National Cancer Database from 9 tumor types: head and neck, gastrointestinal, gynecologic, lymphoma, lung, prostate, breast, bone/soft tissue, and brain/central nervous system. The diagnosis of second cancer was modeled using multivariable logistic regression adjusting for age, follow-up duration, radiotherapy (RT) dose, chemotherapy, sociodemographic variables, and other factors. Propensity score matching also was used to balance baseline characteristics.In total, 450,373 patients were identified (33.5% received 3DCRT, 65.2% received IMRT, and 1.3% received PBRT) with median follow-up of 5.1\u00a0years after RT completion and a cumulative follow-up period of 2.54\u00a0million person-years. Overall, the incidence of second cancer diagnosis was 1.55 per 100 patient-years. In a comparison between IMRT versus 3DCRT, there was no overall difference in the risk of second cancer (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.00; 95% CI, 0.97-1.02; P\u00a0=\u00a0.75). By comparison, PBRT had an overall lower risk of second cancer versus IMRT (adjusted OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.26-0.36; P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). Results within each tumor type generally were consistent in the pooled analyses and also were maintained in propensity score-matched analyses.The risk of a second cancer diagnosis was similar after IMRT versus 3DCRT, whereas PBRT was associated with a lower risk of second cancer risk. Future work is warranted to determine the cost-effectiveness of PBRT and to identify the population best suited for this treatment."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Although most patients with cancer prefer to know their prognosis, prognostic communication between oncologists and patients is often insufficient. Targeted therapies for lung cancer improve survival yet are not curative and produce variable responses. This study sought to describe how oncologists communicate about prognosis with patients receiving targeted therapies for lung cancer.This qualitative study included 39 patients with advanced lung cancer with targetable mutations, 14 caregivers, and 10 oncologists. Semistructured interviews with patients and caregivers and focus groups or interviews with oncologists were conducted to explore their experiences with prognostic communication. One oncology follow-up visit was audio-recorded per patient. A framework approach was used to analyze interview transcripts, and a content analysis of patient-oncologist dialogue was conducted. Themes were identified within each source and then integrated across sources to create a multidimensional description of prognostic communication.Six themes in prognostic communication were identified: Patients with targetable mutations develop a distinct identity in the lung cancer community that affects their information-seeking and self-advocacy; oncologists set high expectations for targeted therapy; the uncertain availability of new therapies complicates prognostic discussions; patients and caregivers have variable information preferences; patients raise questions about progression by asking about physical symptoms or scan results; and patients' expectations of targeted therapy influence their medical decision-making.Optimistic patient-oncologist communication shapes the expectations of patients receiving targeted therapy for lung cancer and affects their decision-making. Further research and clinical guidance are needed to help oncologists to communicate uncertain outcomes effectively."

New cancer sites include the pancreas, kidney and renal pelvis, corpus and uterus, and childhood cancer sites for ages birth to 19 years inclusive.A new reporting delay model is presented for these estimates for more consistent results with the model used for the usual November SEER submissions, adjusting for the large case undercount in the February submission. Joinpoint regression methodology was used to assess trends. Delay-adjusted rates and trends were checked for validity between the February 2016 and November 2016 submissions.Validation revealed that the delay model provides similar estimates of eventual counts using either February or November submission data. Trends declined through 2014 for prostate and colon and rectum cancer for males and females, male and female lung cancer, and cervical cancer. Thyroid cancer and liver and intrahepatic bile duct cancer increased. Pancreas (male and female) and corpus and uterus cancer demonstrated a modest increase. Slight increases occurred for male kidney and renal pelvis, and for all childhood cancer sites for ages birth to 19 years.Evaluating early cancer data submissions, adjusted for reporting delay, produces timely and valid incidence rates and trends. The results of the current study support using delay-adjusted February submission data for valid incidence rate and trend estimates over several data cycles.

This study compares FT domains in young adults (18-39\u00a0years old) (YAs), other working-age adults (40-64\u00a0years old), and older adults (\u226565\u00a0years old) receiving cancer care.A total of 311 adults were surveyed using the multi-domain Economic Strain and Resilience in Cancer instrument measuring FT (0-10 score indicating least to greatest FT; score \u22655 severe FT). Participants were receiving ambulatory care from March-September 2019. Associations of age with overall FT and material hardship, coping resource depletion, and psychological burden FT domains were tested using Kruskal-Wallis and \u03c7<sup>2</sup> tests and multivariable generalized linear models with gamma distribution.YAs (median age, 31.5\u00a0years) comprised 9.6% of the sample; other working-age adults comprised 56.9%. Overall, material, coping, and psychological FT scores were worse in younger age adults versus older adults (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001 in all multivariable models).

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "During the past 4 decades, there has been a growing focus on preserving the fertility of patients with childhood cancer; however, no large studies have been conducted of live births across treatment decades during this period. Therefore, the authors estimated the potential birth deficit in female childhood cancer survivors and the probability of live births.In total, 8886 women were identified in the 5 Nordic cancer registries in whom a childhood cancer had been diagnosed during 1954 through 2006. A population comparison cohort of 62,903 women was randomly selected from the central population registries matched by age and country. All women were followed for live births recorded in medical birth registries. The cumulative probability and the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of a live birth were calculated by maternal age across treatment decades.The probability of a live birth increased with treatment decade, and, at age 30\u00a0years, the rate for survivors most recently diagnosed was close to the rate among the general population (1954-1969: RR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.54-0.78]; 1970s: RR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.60-0.74]; 1980s: RR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.64-0.74]; 1990s: RR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.87-0.95]; 2000s: RR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.91-0.97]).Female childhood cancer survivors had a lower probability of a live birth than women in the general population, although, in survivors diagnosed after 1989, the probability was close to that of the general population. Because the pattern of live births differs by cancer type, continuous efforts must be made to preserve fertility, counsel survivors, and refer them rapidly to fertility treatment if necessary.The purpose of this study was to compare the probability of giving birth to a liveborn child in female survivors of childhood cancer with that of women in the general population. Survivors of childhood cancer had a lower probability of live births than women in the general population, although survivors diagnosed after 1989 had a probability close to that of the general population. Continuing focus on how to preserve the potential for fertility among female patients with childhood cancer during treatment is important to increase their chances of having a child."

    "content": "High levels of sedentary behavior may negatively affect health outcomes in cancer survivors. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to clarify whether postdiagnosis sedentary behavior is related to survival, patient-reported outcomes, and anthropometric outcomes in cancer survivors.The Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL (The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and SPORTDiscus databases were searched from study inception to June 2019. Studies of adults who had been diagnosed with cancer that examined the association between sedentary behavior and mortality, patient-reported outcomes (eg, fatigue, depression), or anthropometric outcomes (eg, body mass index, waist circumference) were eligible for inclusion. Meta-analyses were performed to estimate hazard ratios for the highest compared with the lowest levels of sedentary behavior for all-cause and colorectal cancer-specific mortality outcomes. The ROBINS-E (Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies-of Exposures tool) and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) system were used to assess the risk of bias and the strength of evidence, respectively.Thirty-three eligible publications from a total of 3569 identified articles were included in the review. A higher level of postdiagnosis sedentary behavior was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.06-1.41; heterogeneity [I<sup>2</sup> statistic], 33.8%) as well as colorectal cancer-specific mortality (hazard ratio, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.14-2.06; I<sup>2</sup> , 0%). No clear or consistent associations between sedentary behavior and patient-reported or anthropometric outcomes were identified. The risk of bias in individual studies ranged from moderate to serious, and the strength of evidence ranged from very low to low.Although avoiding high levels of sedentary behavior after a cancer diagnosis may improve survival, further research is required to help clarify whether the association is causal."

To investigate this research gap, the authors examined the effects of the ACA on insurance coverage and receipt of cancer treatment among PLWHC in the United States.HIV-infected individuals aged 18 to 64\u00a0years old\u00a0with cancer diagnosed between 2011 and 2015 were identified in the National Cancer Data Base. Health insurance coverage and cancer treatment receipt were compared before and after implementation of the ACA in non-Medicaid expansion and Medicaid expansion states using difference-in-differences analysis.Of the 4794 PLWHC analyzed, approximately 49% resided in nonexpansion states and were\u00a0more often uninsured (16.7% vs 4.2%), nonwhite (65.2% vs 60.2%), and of low income (36.3% vs 26.9%) compared with those in Medicaid expansion states. After 2014, the percentage of uninsured individuals decreased in expansion states (from 4.9% to 3%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.01) and nonexpansion states (from 17.6% to 14.6%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.06), possibly due to increased Medicaid coverage in expansion states (from 36.9% to 39.2%) and increased private insurance coverage in nonexpansion states (from 29.5% to 34.7%). There was no significant difference in cancer treatment receipt noted between Medicaid expansion and nonexpansion states. However, the percentage of PLWHC treated at academic facilities increased significantly only in expansion states (from 40.2% to 46.7% [P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001]; difference-in-differences analysis: 7.2 percentage points [P\u00a0=\u00a0.02]).The implementation of the ACA was associated with improved insurance coverage among PLWHC. Lack of insurance still is common in non-Medicaid expansion states. Patients with minority or low socioeconomic status more often resided in nonexpansion states, thereby highlighting the need for further insurance expansion."

Cancer is a leading cause of death, and the impact of the pandemic on cancer diagnoses is an important public health concern.This cross-sectional study retrospectively analyzed the electronic medical records of 80,138 cancer patients diagnosed between January 1, 2019, and May 31, 2021. Outcome measures included weekly number of new cancer cases and trends in weekly cancer cases, before and after the pandemic; patient demographics; and positive COVID-19 test rates.Beginning March 4, 2020, defined as the onset of the pandemic, weekly cancer cases declined precipitously (-110.0 cases per week [95% confidence interval, -190.2 to -29.8]) for 4 weeks, followed by a moderate recovery (+23.7 cases per week [9.1 to 38.4]) of 10 weeks duration. Thereafter, weekly cancer cases trended slowly back toward pre-COVID-19 baseline levels. Following the pandemic onset, there was a cumulative year-over-year decline in cancer cases overall of 7.3%, including a 20.2%, 14.3%, and 12.8% decline in nonmelanoma skin cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer, respectively. Changes in case volumes were accompanied by variations in patient characteristics, including region, age, gender, race, insurance coverage, and COVID-19 positive test rates (P < .01 for all). Among patients tested for COVID-19, 5.3% had a positive result.The data in this study demonstrate a substantial reduction in cancer diagnoses following the onset of COVID-19, which appear to reach expected pre-COVID norms 12 months later. The largest reduction was noted among cancers that are typically screen-detected or identified as part of a routine wellness examination."

    "content": "Although increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been observed after chemotherapy and radiotherapy, less is known about radiotherapy-related risks of specific AML subtypes and other specific myeloid neoplasms. We used the US population-based cancer registry data to evaluate risk of myeloid neoplasms among three cohorts of cancer survivors initially treated with radiotherapy only. We included 1-year survivors of first primary thyroid (radioiodine only, stages I-IV; N\u2009=\u200949\u2009879), prostate (excluding stage IV; N\u2009=\u2009237\u2009439), or uterine corpus cancers (stage I-II; N\u2009=\u200916\u2009208) diagnosed during 2000-2013. We calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and excess absolute risks (EARs). Thyroid cancer survivors had significantly elevated risks of total AML (SIR\u2009=\u20092.77, 95% CI: 1.99-3.76), AML with cytogenetic abnormalities (SIR\u2009=\u20093.90, 95% CI: 1.57-8.04), AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (SIR\u2009=\u20092.87, 95% CI: 1.05-6.25), and BCR-ABL1-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) (SIR\u2009=\u20095.38, 95% CI: 2.58-9.89). Irradiated prostate and uterine corpus cancer survivors were at elevated risk for total AML (SIR\u2009=\u20091.14, 95% CI: 1.03-1.27 and SIR\u2009=\u20091.77, 95% CI: 1.01-2.87, respectively), AML with cytogenetic abnormalities (SIR\u2009=\u20092.52, 95% CI: 1.84-3.37 and SIR\u2009=\u20097.21, 95% CI: 2.34-16.83, respectively), and acute promyelocytic leukemia (SIR\u2009=\u20093.20, 95% CI: 2.20-4.49 and SIR\u2009=\u20098.88, 95% CI: 2.42-22.73, respectively). In addition, prostate cancer survivors were at increased risk of BCR-ABL1-positive CML (SIR\u2009=\u20092.11, 95% CI: 1.52-2.85). Our findings support the importance of diagnostic precision in myeloid neoplasm classification since susceptibility following radiotherapy may vary by myeloid neoplasm subtype, thereby informing risk/benefit discussions in first primary cancer treatment."

Siblings, offspring, parents, nephews, and nieces of probands were identified from the Population Registry. Childhood and young adult (ChYA) cancer diagnoses (age 0-39\u00a0years) in relatives were identified by linking to the Finnish Cancer Registry. The relative risk of ChYA cancer in family members of probands was estimated using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs).Among 58,010 family members of the 9078 probands, 363 ChYA cancers were diagnosed, 324 of which were expected (SIR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.01-1.24). The risk of ChYA cancer was elevated both in offspring (SIR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.51-3.24) and in siblings (SIR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.01-1.36). Offspring of probands with retinoblastoma were at highest risk (SIR, 75.85; 95% CI, 32.75-149.45); risks were also elevated for siblings of probands with lymphoma (SIR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.14-2.25). Known cancer predisposition syndromes were observed in 29 (66%) of 44 sibling pairs with cancers diagnosed at <21\u00a0years of age and in 20% of the 135 families with a childhood cancer proband whose sibling was diagnosed with a young adult malignancy.Linked population-based registry data indicate a modestly increased risk of ChYA in relatives of children with cancer. Some of the observed cancer clusters in the cohort suggest novel patterns and familial cancer syndromes."

    "title": "Has the cancer-related death trend been changing in Turkey? An evaluation of the period between 2009 and 2019.",
    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "The objective of this study was to determine the trend of cancer-related death rates between 2009 and 2019 in Turkey for all cancers combined and the five cancer types with the highest mortality: lung, stomach, pancreas, breast, and colon cancers.Cancer mortality data were obtained from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TURKSTAT) and standardized by age using the World Health Organization (WHO) standard population ratios. The change in cancer-related mortality over the years was evaluated using Joinpoint Regression Analysis (JRA).Total cancer-related deaths increased by 2.2% annually between 2009 and 2014 and decreased by 2.9% annually between 2014 and 2019 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Among men; lung cancer-related deaths increased by 2.4% annually between 2009 and 2014 and decreased by 3.4% annually between 2014 and 2019 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), stomach cancer-related deaths decreased by 5.1% annually between 2014 and 2019 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), colon cancer-related deaths increased by 5.8% annually between 2009 and 2015 and decreased by 3.3% annually between 2015 and 2019 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), pancreatic cancer-related deaths increased annually by 5.6% in 2009-2013 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Among women; lung cancer-related deaths increased by 2.5% annually between 2009 and 2016 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), stomach cancer-related deaths increased annually by 2.3% between 2009 and 2014 and decreased annually by 4.5% between 2014 and 2019 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), colon cancer-related deaths increased by 2.5% annually between 2009 and 2017 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), pancreatic cancer-related deaths increased by 7.4% annually between 2009 and 2013 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and breast cancer-related deaths increased by 2.2% annually between 2009 and 2019 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).Mortality data in Turkey are collected only by TURKSTAT, which raises concern regarding the incompletion of the data. While this might lead to underestimation, the trend shows that there has been a decrease in total cancer-related deaths in Turkey. Pancreatic cancer, on the other hand, gains a higher proportion in cancer-related deaths in Turkey as in the world. Increasing deaths from lung and breast cancer in women remind of the importance of tobacco control interventions and cancer screening programs."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Although adherence to the American Cancer Society (ACS) Guidelines on Nutrition and Physical Activity for Cancer Prevention associates with lower risk of obesity-related cancer (ORC) incidence and mortality, evidence in Black and Latina women is limited. This association was examined in Black and Latina participants in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI).Semi-Markov multistate model examined the association between ACS guideline adherence and ORC incidence and mortality in the presence of competing events, combined and separately, for 9301 Black and 4221 Latina postmenopausal women. Additionally, ACS guideline adherence was examined in a subset of less common ORCs and potential effect modification by neighborhood socioeconomic status and smoking.Over a median of 11.1, 12.5, and 3.7\u2009years of follow-up for incidence, nonconditional mortality, and conditional mortality, respectively, 1191 ORCs (Black/Latina women: 841/269), 1970 all-cause deaths (Black/Latina women: 1576/394), and 341 ORC-related deaths (Black/Latina women: 259/82) were observed. Higher ACS guideline adherence was associated with lower ORC incidence for both Black (cause-specific hazard ratio [CSHR]<sub>highvs.low</sub> : 0.72; 95% CI, 0.55-0.94) and Latina (CSHR<sub>highvs.low</sub> : 0.58, 95% CI, 0.36-0.93) women; but not conditional all-cause mortality (Black hazard ratio [HR]<sub>highvs.low</sub> : 0.86; 95% CI, 0.53-1.39; Latina HR<sub>highvs.low</sub> : 0.81; 95% CI, 0.32-2.06). Higher adherence was associated with lower incidence of less common ORC (P<sub>trend</sub> \u00a0=\u00a0.025), but conditional mortality events were limited. Adherence and ORC-specific deaths were not associated and there was no evidence of effect modification.Adherence to the ACS guidelines was associated with lower risk of ORCs and less common ORCs but was not for conditional ORC-related mortality.Evidence on the association between the American Cancer Society Guidelines on Nutrition and Physical Activity for Cancer Prevention and cancer remains scarce for women of color. Adherence to the guidelines and risk of developing one of 13 obesity-related cancers among Black and Latina women in the Women's Health Initiative was examined. Women who followed the lifestyle guidelines had 28% to 42% lower risk of obesity-related cancer. These findings support public health interventions to reduce growing racial/ethnic disparities in obesity-related cancers."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "The objective of this study was to compare the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of Dutch adult male and female childhood cancer survivors (CCSs) to general population references and to study medical determinants.CCSs from the Dutch Childhood Cancer Survivor Study LATER cohort (1963-2001) part 2, who were 18 years old or older (time since diagnosis \u2265 5 years), were invited to complete the TNO-AZL Questionnaire for Adult Health-Related Quality of Life. Domain scores and proportions of CCSs with impaired HRQOL (score < 25th percentile of the reference scores) were compared with references via Mann-Whitney U tests and logistic regression analyses corrected for age and sex (P < .004). Interactions of group with sex were included if they were significant (P < .05). Moreover, medical determinants were analyzed with multivariable logistic regression analyses.HRQOL scores for 1766 CCSs (mean age, 35.9 years [standard deviation, 9.4 years]; male, 51%; response rate, 71%) differed from references on most domains with small effect sizes. Both male and female CCSs were more often impaired in gross and fine motor functioning, cognitive functioning, sleep, and vitality with odds ratios (ORs) > 1.4. In addition, female CCSs were more often impaired in daily activities, pain, and sexuality (ORs, 1.4-1.9) and were less often aggressive (OR, 0.6). CCCs of central nervous system (CNS) tumors, bone tumors, and retinoblastoma and those with cranial, abdominopelvic, or lower extremity radiotherapy were at increased risk of impairment in 1 or more domains.Dutch adult CCSs, especially females, have impaired HRQOL in several domains; this is most pronounced in cognitive functioning. The vulnerabilities of subgroups at risk, such as CCSs of CNS tumors, were confirmed. Surveillance of HRQOL and multidisciplinary survivor care are recommended.The health-related quality of life in a Dutch nationwide cohort of 1766 survivors of childhood cancer was studied. Survivors of childhood cancer were found to have lower health-related quality of life in several domains (eg, motor functioning and vitality) in comparison with the general population. They most often reported low cognitive functioning (eg, memory and attention). Females had low health-related quality of life in more domains than males. Survivors of brain tumors had low health-related quality of life in most domains. Monitoring health-related quality of life regularly and collaborating between disciplines in survivor care is recommended."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Concerns have been raised about access to cancer screening and the timely receipt of cancer care for people with an intellectual disability (ID). However, knowledge about cancer mortality as a potential consequence of these disparities is still limited. This study, therefore, compared cancer-related mortality patterns between people with and without ID.A historical cohort study (2015-2019) linked the Dutch adult population (approximately 12 million people with an ID prevalence of 1.45%) and mortality registries. Cancer-related mortality was identified by the underlying cause of death (according to the chapter on neoplasms in the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision). Observed mortality and calculated age- and sex-standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported.There were 11,102 deaths in the ID population (21.7% cancer-related; n = 2408) and 730,405 deaths in the general population (31.2%; n = 228,120) available for analysis. Cancer was noted as the cause of death more often among people with ID in comparison with the general population (SMR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.42-1.54), particularly in the young age groups. High-mortality cancers included cancers within the national screening program (SMRs, 1.43-1.94), digestive cancers (SMRs, 1.24-2.56), bladder cancer (SMR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.61-2.54), and cancers of unknown primary (SMR, 2.48; 95% CI, 2.06-2.89).Cancer was reported as the cause of death approximately 1.5 times more often in people with ID compared with the general population. This mortality disparity may indicate adverse effects from inequalities in screening and cancer care experienced by people with ID.People with an intellectual disability (ID) may find it challenging to participate in cancer screening or to receive timely cancer care. To understand potential consequences in terms of mortality, this study compared cancer-related mortality between people with and without ID in the Netherlands. Cancer was reported as the cause of death approximately 1.5 times more often among people with ID than others. Because large differences were found that were related to screening cancers and cancers for which the primary tumor was unknown, this study's results raise concerns about equality in screening practices and cancer care for people with ID."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Educational achievement and employment outcomes are critical indicators of quality of life in survivors of childhood, adolescent, and young adult (CAYA) cancer. This review is aimed at providing an evidence-based clinical practice guideline (CPG) with internationally harmonized recommendations for the surveillance of education and employment outcomes in survivors of CAYA cancer diagnosed before the age of 30\u00a0years. The CPG was developed by a multidisciplinary panel under the umbrella of the International Late Effects of Childhood Cancer Guideline Harmonization Group. After evaluating concordances and discordances of 4 existing CPGs, the authors performed a systematic literature search through February 2021. They screened articles for eligibility, assessed quality, and extracted and summarized the data from included articles. The authors formulated recommendations based on the evidence and clinical judgment. There were 3930 articles identified, and 83 of them, originating from 17 countries, were included. On a group level, survivors were more likely to have lower educational achievement and more likely to be unemployed than comparisons. Key risk factors for poor outcomes included receiving a primary diagnosis of a central nervous system tumor and experiencing late effects. The authors recommend that health care providers be aware of the risk of educational and employment problems, implement regular surveillance, and refer survivors to specialists if problems are identified. In conclusion, this review presents a harmonized CPG that aims to facilitate evidence-based care, positively influence education and employment outcomes, and ultimately minimize the burden of disease and treatment-related late adverse effects for survivors of CAYA cancers. LAY SUMMARY: A multidisciplinary panel has developed guidelines for the surveillance of education and employment outcomes among survivors of childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancer. On the basis of evidence showing that survivors are at risk for lower educational achievement and unemployment, it is recommended that all survivors receive regular screening for educational and employment outcomes."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Gynaecologic cancers are common among women and treatment includes surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy, where the last two methods induce DNA damage in non-targeted cells like peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). Damaged normal cells can transform leading to second malignant neoplasms (SMN) but the level of risk and impact of risk modifiers is not well defined. We investigated how radiotherapy alone or in combination with chemotherapy induce DNA damage in PBL of cervix and endometrial cancer patients during therapy. Blood samples were collected from nine endometrial cancer patients (treatment with radiotherapy + chemotherapy-RC) and nine cervical cancer patients (treatment with radiotherapy alone-R) before radiotherapy, 3 weeks after onset of radiotherapy and at the end of radiotherapy. Half of each blood sample was irradiated ex vivo with 2 Gy of gamma radiation in order to check how therapy influenced the sensitivity of PBL to radiation. Analysed endpoints were micronucleus (MN) frequencies, apoptosis frequencies and cell proliferation index. The results were characterised by strong individual variation, especially the MN frequencies and proliferation index. On average, despite higher total dose and larger fields, therapy alone induced the same level of MN in PBL of RC patients as compared to R. This result was accompanied by a higher level of apoptosis and stronger inhibition of cell proliferation in RC patients. The ex vivo dose induced fewer MN, more apoptosis and more strongly inhibited proliferation of PBL of RC as compared to R patients. These results are interpreted as evidence for a sensitizing effect of chemotherapy on radiation cytotoxicity. The possible implications for the risk of second malignant neoplasms are discussed."

    "content": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between self-identified race and overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and response to therapy among patients enrolled in the randomized Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB)/SWOG 80405 trial.Patients with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer who were enrolled in the CALGB/SWOG 80405 trial were identified by race. On the basis of covariates (treatment arm, KRAS status, sex, age, and body mass index), each Black patient was exact matched with a White patient. The association between race and OS and PFS was examined using a marginal Cox proportional hazard model for matched pairs. The interaction between KRAS status and race was tested in the model. The association between race and response to therapy and adverse events were examined using a marginal logistic regression model.In total, 392 patients were matched and included in the final data set. No difference in OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-1.16), PFS (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.78-1.20), or response to therapy (odds ratio [OR], 1.00; 95% CI, 0.65-1.52) was observed between Black and White patients. Patients with KRAS mutant status (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.02-1.67), a performance statusscore of 1 (reference, a performance status of 0; HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.18-1.88), or \u22653 metastatic sites (reference, 1 metastatic site; HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.22-2.28) experienced worse OS. Black patients experienced lower rates and risk of grade \u22653 fatigue (6.6% vs 13.3%; OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.24-0.91) but were equally likely to be treated with a dose reduction (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.72-1.65).No difference in OS, PFS, or response to therapy was observed between Black patients and White patients in an equal treatment setting of the CALGB/SWOG 80405 randomized controlled trial.Despite improvements in screening and treatment, studies have demonstrated worse outcomes in Black patients with colorectal cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there was a difference in cancer-specific outcomes among Black and White patients receiving equivalent treatment on the CALGB/SWOG 80405 randomized clinical trial. In this study, there was no difference in overall survival, progression-free survival, or response to therapy between Black and White patients treated on a clinical trial. These findings suggest that access to care and differences in treatment may be responsible for racial disparities in colorectal cancer."

All phase 2, 2/3, and 3 trials activated during the period between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2019, were identified (n\u00a0=\u00a01568) and reduced to a set of 304 that met predetermined criteria to focus on cooperative group-led trials that involved therapy for newly diagnosed cancer and had age eligibility overlapping the AYA range. The proportion of AYA patients relative to total accrual, along with 95% bootstrapped CI was calculated for patients enrolled pre-NCTN and post-NCTN.AYA accrual comprised 9.5% (95% CI, 7.6-11.8) pre-NCTN compared with 14.0% (95% CI, 9.9-18.3) post-NCTN. The mean difference in proportions post-NCTN compared with pre-NCTN was 4.4% (0.7%-8.3%).These results indicate an increase in AYA participation in trials conducted within the NCTN relative to the pre-NCTN period. This suggests an awareness and utilization of NCTN trials for AYAs with cancer."

Rates of pathogenic/likely pathogenic germline variants (PVs) and downstream counseling were compared across ancestry groups (mutually exclusive groups based on self-reported race/ethnicity and Ashkenazi Jewish [AJ] heritage) using nonparametric tests and multivariable logistic regression models.Among 15,775 patients (59.6%, non-Hispanic [NH]-White; 15.7%, AJ; 20.5%, non-White [6.9%, Asian; 6.8%, Black/African American (AA); 6.7%, Hispanic; 0.1%, Other], and 4.2%, unknown), 2663 (17%) had a PV. Non-White patients had a lower PV rate (n\u00a0=\u00a0433, 13.4%) compared to NH-Whites (n\u00a0=\u00a01451, 15.4%) and AJ patients (n\u00a0=\u00a0683, 27.6%), p\u2009<\u2009.01, with differences in mostly moderate and low/recessive/uncertain penetrance variants. Among 2239 patients with new PV, 1652 (73.8%) completed recommended genetic counseling. Non-White patients had lower rates of genetic counseling (67.7%) than NH-White (73.7%) and AJ patients (78.8%), p\u2009<\u2009.01, with lower rates occurring in Black/AA (63%) compared to NH-White patients, even after adjustment for confounders (odds ratio, 0.60; 95% confidence interval, 0.37-0.97; p\u00a0=\u00a0.036). Non-White, particularly Black/AA and Asian, probands had a trend toward lower rates and numbers of at-risk family members being seen for counseling/genetic testing.Despite minimizing barriers to genetic testing, non-White patients were less likely to receive recommended cancer genetics follow-up, with potential implications for oncologic care, cancer risk reduction, and at-risk family members.Genetic testing is becoming an important part of cancer care, and we wanted to see if genetics care was different between individuals of different backgrounds. We studied 15,775 diverse patients with cancer who had genetic testing using a test called MSK-IMPACT that was covered by research funding. Clinically important genetic findings were high in all groups. However, Black patients were less likely to get recommended counseling compared to White patients. Even after removing many roadblocks, non-White and especially Black patients were less likely to get recommended genetics care, which may affect their cancer treatments and families."

    "content": "Gathering information directly from cancer survivors has advanced our understanding of the cancer survivorship experience. However, it is unknown whether surveys can distinguish important subgroups of cancer survivors. This study aimed to describe the current landscape of survey questions used to identify and describe cancer survivors in national cross-sectional studies.Using publicly available databases, the authors identified national cross-sectional surveys used in the United States within the past 15 years that included a question on self-reported history of cancer. After abstracting questions and response items used to identify cancer survivors, they conducted a descriptive analysis.The authors identified 14 national cross-sectional surveys, with half administered to the general population and the other half administered to cancer survivors. The most common question used to identify cancer survivors was \"Have you ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that you had cancer?\" Most surveys had questions asking participants to identify a single cancer type (n = 11), multiple prior cancer diagnoses or types (n = 11), and the time from diagnosis (n = 12). Treatment questions varied from active treatment status to specific treatments received. Questions addressing cancer stage (n = 2), subtypes (n = 1), metastatic status (n = 3), and recurrence (n = 4) were less frequently included.There is no standard method for assessing self-reported cancer history, and this limits the ability to distinguish among potentially important subgroups of survivors. Future cross-sectional surveys that capture nuanced data elements, such as cancer types, stages/subtypes, metastatic/recurrent status, and treatments received, can help to fill important gaps in cancer survivorship research and clinical care."

If and how cancer survivors were affected by the first year of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are largely unknown.Using data from the nationwide, population-based Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (2017-2020), the authors investigated changes in health-related measures during the COVID-19 pandemic among cancer survivors and compared them with changes among adults without a cancer history in the United States. Sociodemographic and health-related measures such as insurance coverage, employment status, health behaviors, and health status were self-reported. Adjusted prevalence ratios of health-related measures in 2020 versus 2017-2019 were calculated with multivariable logistic regressions and stratified by age group (18-64 vs. \u226565\u2009years).Among adults aged 18-64\u2009years, the uninsured rate did not change significantly in 2020 despite increases in unemployment. The prevalence of unhealthy behaviors, such as insufficient sleep and smoking, decreased in 2020, and self-rated health improved, regardless of cancer history. Notably, declines in smoking were larger among cancer survivors than nonelderly adults without a cancer history. Few changes were observed for adults aged \u226565\u2009years.Further research is needed to confirm the observed positive health behavior and health changes and to investigate the role of potential mechanisms, such as the national and regional policy responses to the pandemic regarding insurance coverage, unemployment benefits, and financial assistance. As polices related to the public health emergency expire, ongoing monitoring of longer term effects of the pandemic on cancer survivorship is warranted."

    "content": "Measuring function with valid and responsive tools in patients with cancer is essential for driving clinical decision-making and for the end points of clinical trials. Current patient-reported outcome measurements of function fall short for many reasons. This study evaluates the responsiveness of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Cancer Function Brief 3D Profile, a novel measure of function across multiple domains.Two hundred nine participants across five geographically distinct tertiary care centers completed the assessment and pain rating at two outpatient cancer rehabilitation clinic visits. Patients and providers completed a global rating of change measure at the second visit to indicate whether the patient was improving or worsening in function. Multiple response indices and linear models measured whether the measure was responsive to self-reported and clinician-rated changes over time. Correlations between changes in function and changes in anchors (pain rating and performance status) were also calculated.Function as measured by the PROMIS Cancer Function Brief 3D Profile changed appropriately as both patients and clinicians rated change. Small to moderate effect sizes supported the tool's responsiveness. Function was moderately correlated with pain and more strongly correlated with performance status, and changes in function corresponded with changes in anchor variables. No floor/ceiling effect was found.The PROMIS Cancer Function Brief 3D Profile is sensitive to changes over time in patients with cancer. The measure may be useful in clinical practice and as an end point in clinical trials.We gave patients a questionnaire by which they told their physicians how well they were functioning, including how fatigued they were. This study tested that questionnaire to see whether the scores would change if patients got better or worse."

However, to the authors' knowledge, little is known regarding the prevalence and health care needs of this growing population, particularly in safety net settings.The authors identified adults with a history of cancer documented in primary care electronic health records within a network of community health centers (CHCs) in 19 states. The authors estimated cancer history prevalence among >1.2\u00a0million patients and compared sex-specific site distributions with national estimates. Each survivor was matched to 3 patients without cancer from the same set of clinics. The demographic characteristics, primary care use, and comorbidity burden then were compared between the 2 groups, assessing differences with absolute standardized mean differences (ASMDs). ASMD values >0.1 denote meaningful differences between groups. Generalized estimating equations yielded adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for select indicators.A total of 40,266 cancer survivors were identified (prevalence of 3.0% of adult CHC patients). Compared with matched cancer-free patients, a higher percentage of survivors had \u22656 primary care visits across 3\u00a0years (62% vs 48%) and were insured (83% vs 74%) (ASMD, >0.1 for both). Cancer survivors had excess medical complexity, including a higher prevalence of depression, asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and liver disease (ASMD, >0.1 for all). Survivors had higher odds of any opioid prescription (aOR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.19-1.27) and chronic opioid therapy (aOR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.23-1.32) compared with matched controls (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001 for all).Identifying cancer survivors and understanding their patterns of utilization and physical and mental comorbidities present an opportunity to tailor primary health care services to this population."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Heterogeneous evidence exists on the effect of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the clinical outcomes of patients with cancer.A systematic review was performed using the Medline, Embase, and CENTRAL databases and the World Health Organization Novel Coronavirus website to identify studies that reported mortality and characteristics of patients with cancer who were diagnosed with COVID-19. The primary study outcome was mortality, defined as all-cause mortality or in-hospital mortality within 30 days of initial COVID-19 diagnosis. The pooled proportion of mortality was estimated using a random-effects model, and study-level moderators of heterogeneity were assessed through subgroup analysis and metaregression.Among 2922 patients from 13 primarily inpatient studies of individuals with COVID-19 and cancer, the pooled 30-day mortality rate was 30% (95% CI, 25%-35%). The overall pooled 30-day mortality rate among 624 patients from 5 studies that included a mixture of inpatient and outpatient populations was 15% (95% CI, 9%-22%). Among the hospitalized studies, the heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> statistic) of the meta-analysis remained high (I<sup>2</sup> , 82%). Cancer subtype (hematologic vs solid), older age, male sex, and recent active cancer therapy each partially explained the heterogeneity of mortality reporting. In multivariable metaregression, male sex, along with an interaction between the median patient age and recent active cancer therapy, explained most of the between-study heterogeneity (R<sup>2</sup> , 96%).Pooled mortality estimates for hospitalized patients with cancer and COVID-19 remain high at 30%, with significant heterogeneity across studies. Dedicated community-based studies are needed in the future to help assess overall COVID-19 mortality among the broader population of patients with cancer."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cancer (HLRCC) is a cancer syndrome associated with a germline mutation in fumarate hydratase (FH). The syndrome is associated with cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas, and some patients develop a lethal form of kidney cancer. This study provides estimates for the FH carrier frequency and kidney cancer penetrance.Data sets containing sequencing data for the FH gene were used: the 1000 Genomes Project (1000GP) and the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC). Alterations in the FH gene were characterized on the basis of different variant risk tiers: 1) ClinVar annotated variants, 2) loss-of-function alterations, and 3) highly impactful missense alterations. The cumulative incidence of FH alterations overall and by different world populations was evaluated in 1000GP and ExAC. A lifetime penetrance of HLRCC kidney cancer risk was generated with 3 estimates of the annual incidence.The overall allele frequencies of tier 1 to 3 FH alterations in the ExAC and 1000GP data sets were 2.54 \u00d7 10<sup>-3</sup> (1 in 393) and 1.20 \u00d7 10<sup>-3</sup> (1 in 835), respectively. There were differences in the allele frequencies of FH alterations between world populations. Based on various estimates of the percentage of kidney cancers with FH alterations, the lifetime kidney cancer penetrance for carrier estimate 3 in ExAC was 1.7% to 5.8%.FH alterations are common and are carried by approximately 1 in 1000 individuals according to the more conservative estimates. The lifetime kidney cancer penetrance appears lower than previously estimated. Although databases are not population cohorts, they provide a useful quantitative estimate of rare variants with low penetrance."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "eHealth interventions can help cancer survivors self-manage their health outside the clinic. Little is known about how best to engage and assist survivors across the age and cancer treatment spectra.The American Cancer Society conducted a randomized controlled trial that assessed efficacy of, and engagement with, Springboard Beyond Cancer, an eHealth self-management program for cancer survivors. Intent-to treat analyses assessed effects of intervention engagement for treatment (on-treatment vs completed) overall (n = 176; 88 control, 88 intervention arm) and separately by age (<60 years vs older). Multiple imputation was used to account for participants who were lost to follow-up (n = 41) or missing self-efficacy data (n = 1) at 3 months follow-up.Self-efficacy for managing cancer, the primary outcome of this trial, increased significantly within the intervention arm and for those who had completed treatment (Cohen's d = 0.26, 0.31, respectively). Additionally, participants with moderate-to-high engagement in the text and/or web intervention (n = 30) had a significantly greater self-efficacy for managing cancer-related issues compared to the control group (n = 68), with a medium effect size (Cohen's d = 0.44). Self-efficacy did not differ between the intervention and control arm at 3 months post-baseline.Study results suggest that cancer survivors benefit variably from eHealth tools. To maximize effects of such tools, it is imperative to tailor information to a priori identified survivor subgroups and increase engagement efforts."

Cancer surveillance has noted a significant survival advantage in individuals with LFS; however, little is known about the feasibility, acceptance, and psychosocial effects of such a program.Pathogenic TP53 germline variant carriers completed a 7-part questionnaire evaluating sociodemographics, cancer history, surveillance participation, reasons for nonadherence, worries, and distress adapted from the Cancer Worry Scale. Counselees' common concerns and suggestions were assessed in MAXQDA Analytics Pro 12.Forty-nine participants (46 females and 3 males), aged 40.0 \u00b1 12.6\u00a0years, formed the study population; 43 (88%) had a personal cancer history (including multiple cancers in 10 [20%]). Forty-three individuals participated (88%) in surveillance during the study or formerly. Willingness to undergo surveillance was influenced by satisfaction with genetic testing and counseling (P\u00a0=\u00a0.019 [Fisher-Yates test]) but not by sociodemographics, cancer history, or distress level. Almost one-third of the participants reported logistical difficulties in implementing surveillance because of the high frequency of medical visits, scheduling difficulties, and the travel distance to their surveillance providers. Self-reported distress and perceived emotional burden for family members and partners were moderate (median for self-reported distress, 3.3; median for perceived emotional burden, 3.0). For both, the interquartile range was moderate to very high (2.7-3.7 and 3.0-3.7, respectively).Individuals with LFS require efficient counseling as well as an accessible, well-organized, interdisciplinary, standardized surveillance program to increase adherence and psychological coping."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Anthracycline-related cardiomyopathy is a leading cause of late morbidity in childhood cancer survivors. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a class of phase II detoxification enzymes that facilitate the elimination of anthracyclines. As free-radical scavengers, GSTs could play a role in oxidative damage-induced cardiomyopathy. Associations between the GST\u03bc1 (GSTM1) null genotype and iron-overload-related cardiomyopathy have been reported in patients with thalassemia.The authors sought to identify an association between the GSTM1 null genotype and anthracycline-related cardiomyopathy in childhood cancer survivors and to corroborate the association by examining GSTM1 gene expression in peripheral blood and human-induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) from survivors with and without cardiomyopathy. GSTM1 gene deletion was examined by polymerase chain reaction in 75 survivors who had clinically validated cardiomyopathy (cases) and in 92 matched survivors without cardiomyopathy (controls). Conditional logistic regression analysis adjusting for sex, age at cancer diagnosis, chest radiation, and anthracycline dose was used to assess the association between genotype and cardiomyopathy. Proprietary bead array technology and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to measure GSTM1 expression levels in samples from 20 cases and 20 matched controls. hiPSC-CMs from childhood cancer survivors (3 with cardiomyopathy, 3 without cardiomyopathy) also were examined for GSTM1 gene expression levels.A significant association was observed between the risk of cardiomyopathy and the GSTM1 null genotype (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.3-5.9; P\u00a0=\u00a0.007). There was significant downregulation of GSTM1 expression in cases compared with controls (average relative expression, 0.67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.57 vs 1.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.33, respectively; P\u00a0=\u00a0.049). hiPSC-CMs from patients who had cardiomyopathy revealed reduced GSTM1 expression (P\u00a0=\u00a0.007).The current findings could facilitate the identification of childhood cancer survivors who are at risk for anthracycline-related cardiomyopathy."

However, little is known about the risk factors of in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients with and without cancer in Brazil. The objective of this study was to evaluate the risk factors of in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients with and without cancer and to compare mortality according to gender and topography during the year 2020 in Brazil.This was a secondary data study of hospitalized adult patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 by real-time polymerase chain reaction testing in Brazil. The data were collected from the Influenza Epidemiological Surveillance Information System.This study analyzed data from 322,817 patients. The prevalence of cancer in patients with COVID-19 was 2.3%. COVID-19 patients with neurological diseases and cancer had the most lethal comorbidities in both sexes. COVID-19 patients with cancer were more likely to be older (median age, 67 vs 62 years; P < .001), to have a longer hospital stay (13.1 vs 11.5 days; P < .001), to be admitted to the intensive care unit (45.3% vs 39.6%; P < .001), to receive more invasive mechanical ventilation (27.1% vs 21.9%), and to have a higher risk of death (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.83-2.06; P < .001) than those without cancer. Patients with hematological neoplasia (aOR, 2.85; 95% CI, 2.41-3.38; P < .001) had a higher risk of mortality than those with solid tumors (aOR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.72-1.95; P < .001) in both sexes.Brazilian COVID-19 patients with cancer have higher disease severity and a higher risk of mortality than those without cancer."

    "content": "Epidemiologic evidence reporting the role of frailty in survival among older adults with a prior cancer diagnosis is limited.A total of 2050 older adults (\u226560 years old) surviving for at least 1 year after a cancer diagnosis and 9474 older adults without a cancer history from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2014) were included for analysis. The exposure variable, a 45-item frailty index (FI), was categorized on the basis of validated cutoffs (FI \u2264 0.10 [fit], 0.10 < FI \u2264 0.21 [prefrail], and FI > 0.21 [frail]). All-cause mortality was ascertained via the National Death Index. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence interval (CIs) for the FI, and this was followed by restricted cubic splines depicting dose-response curves.For older cancer survivors, the mean age at the baseline was 72.6 years (SD, 7.1 years); 5.9% were fit, 38.2% were prefrail, and 55.9% were frail. Older adults without a cancer history were slightly younger (mean age, 70.0 years) and less frail (47.9% were frail). At each level of the FI, cancer survivors (1.9 per 100 person-years for FI \u2264 0.10, 3.4 per 100 person-years for 0.10 < FI \u2264 0.21, and 7.5 per 100 person-years for FI > 0.21) had higher mortality than their cancer-free counterparts (1.4 per 100 person-years for FI \u2264 0.10, 2.4 per 100 person-years for 0.10 < FI \u2264 0.21, and 5.4 per 100 person-years for FI > 0.21). The multivariable model suggested a positive association between the FI and all-cause mortality for survivors (aHR for FI > 0.21 vs FI \u2264 0.10, 2.80; 95% CI, 1.73-4.53) and participants without a cancer history (aHR for FI > 0.21 vs FI \u2264 0.10, 2.75; 95% CI, 2.29-3.32). Restricted cubic splines indicated that all-cause mortality risk increased with the FI in a monotonic pattern.Frailty is associated with a higher risk of death in older cancer survivors and the elderly without a cancer history."

We aim to provide recommendations for opportunistic screening for individuals whose sibling had been diagnosed with cancer.During the physical examination in Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, 43,300 people were asked if they have at least two siblings who developed cancer.A total of 1270 sibling-pairs from 766 families developed cancer, including 367 pairs of brothers (Bro-pairs), 368 pairs of sisters (Sis-pairs), and 535 pairs of brother-and-sister (BroSis-pairs). The mean ages at diagnosis of cancer for the three groups were from 58 to 62\u2009years. More than half of Bro-pairs (55.3%) or Sis-pairs (51.1%) had cancer from the same systemic origin, and more than a quarter of Bro-pairs (28.1%) and Sis-pairs (37.2%) developed the same type of cancer. However, only 36.0% of BroSis-pairs developed cancers from the same systemic origin, and 18.9% developed the same type of cancer. In Bro-pairs and BroSis-pairs, lung cancer and digestive system cancer were the most common cancers, while in Sis-pairs, breast cancer, lung cancer, cervical cancer, liver cancer and thyroid cancer were the most common ones.If an individual's sibling is diagnosed with cancer, the individual should consider participating in opportunistic screening annually, especially for lung cancer and digestive system cancers for both sexes. For sisters, breast cancer, cervical cancer and thyroid cancer should be screened early. Additionally, genetic services are essential for individuals who have siblings with cancer."

    "content": "Patients with prior colon cancer have increased risk of metachronous colorectal neoplasms; therefore, endoscopic surveillance is indicated. Current recommendations are not risk-stratified. We investigated predictive factors for colorectal neoplasms to build a model to spare colonoscopies for low-risk patients.This was a multicenter, retrospective study including patients who underwent surgery for colon cancer in 2001\u200a-\u200a2008 (derivation cohort) and 2009\u200a-\u200a2013 (validation cohort). A predictive model for neoplasm occurrence at second surveillance colonoscopy was developed and validated.421 and 203 patients were included in derivation and validation cohort, respectively. At second surveillance colonoscopy, 112 (26.6\u200a%) and 55 (27.1\u200a%) patients had metachronous neoplasms in derivation and validation groups; three cancers were detected in the latter. History of left-sided colon cancer (OR 1.64, 95\u200a%CI 1.02\u200a-\u200a2.64), \u2265\u200a1 advanced adenoma at index colonoscopy (OR 1.90, 95\u200a%CI 1.05\u200a-\u200a3.43), and \u2265\u200a1 adenoma at first surveillance colonoscopy (OR 2.06, 95\u200a%CI 1.29\u200a-\u200a3.27) were independently predictive of metachronous colorectal neoplasms at second surveillance colonoscopy. For patients without such risk factors, diagnostic accuracy parameters were: 89.3\u200a% (95\u200a%CI 82.0\u200a%-94.3\u200a%) and 78.2\u200a% (95\u200a%CI 65.0\u200a%-88.2\u200a%) sensitivity, and 28.5\u200a% (95\u200a%CI 23.5\u200a%-33.9\u200a%) and 33.8\u200a% (95\u200a%CI 26.2\u200a%-42.0\u200a%) specificity in derivation and validation group, respectively. No cancer would be missed.Patients with prior left-sided colon cancer or \u2265\u200a1 advanced adenoma at index colonoscopy or \u2265\u200a1 adenoma at first surveillance colonoscopy had a significantly higher risk of neoplasms at second surveillance colonoscopy; patients without such factors had much lower risk and could safely skip the second surveillance colonoscopy.

However, the intersections of aging-related health risks across the cancer control continuum are poorly understood, limiting the integration of aging into cancer control research and practice. The objective of this study was to review the state of science and provide future directions to improve the quality of evidence in 6 priority research areas in cancer and aging.The authors identified priority research areas in cancer and aging through an evidence-based Research Jam process involving 32 investigators and trainees from multiple disciplines and research centers in aging and cancer; then, they conducted a narrative review of the state of the science and future directions to improve the quality of evidence in these research areas. Priority research areas were defined as those in which gaps in scientific evidence or clinical practice limit the health and well-being of older adults with cancer.Six priority research areas were identified: cognitive and physical functional outcomes of older cancer survivors, sampling issues in studies of older cancer survivors, risk and resilience across the lifespan, caregiver support and well-being, quality of care for older patients with cancer, and health disparities. Evidence in these areas could be improved through the incorporation of bias reduction techniques into longitudinal studies of older cancer survivors, novel data linkage, and improved representation of older adults in cancer research.The priority research areas and methodologies identified here may be used to guide interdisciplinary research and improve the quality of evidence on cancer and aging."

In the current study, the authors estimated the latest burden and trends of HPV-attributable cancers in China.Data from the following sources were used. The number of new cancer cases and cancer deaths in China were estimated based on the China Cancer Registry Annual Report. The population-attributable fraction was estimated using pooled high-risk HPV prevalence and biomarker-positive rates, which were calculated using random effects meta-analyses. Cancer burden estimates were stratified by anatomic site, sex, and age.In 2015, a total of 110,650 new cancer cases and 36,714 cancer deaths attributable to HPV infection were estimated to have occurred in China, of which cervical cancer accounted for 85.6% and 78.1%, respectively. The age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) of HPV-attributable cancers were 5.63 and 1.81 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. The ASIR and ASMR both varied by anatomic site, with the highest rates noted for cervical cancer at 4.83 and 1.42 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. Between 2005 and 2015, the ASIR and ASMR demonstrated significant upward trends for all HPV-attributable cancers combined.Between 2005 and 2015, cervical cancer accounted for the vast majority of HPV-attributable cancers and its incidence\u00a0and mortality increased rapidly in China. The comprehensive prevention of cervical cancer remains the most important target in the prevention of HPV-attributable cancers."

Although inflammation is reliably associated with depression in otherwise healthy individuals, the association in patients with cancer remains unclear. Given the high prevalence of cancer-related inflammation, the authors aimed to establish the relationship between inflammation and depression in cancer patients based on extant literature.A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 guidelines and registered under Prospero ID CRD42021226743. Three databases were searched including PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO using the following criteria for inclusion: 1) measurement of a peripheral inflammatory marker, 2) use of a validated tool/scale to measure depression, and 3) a cancer diagnosis. Risk of publication bias was assessed by Funnel plot and Egger test.Seventy-three studies were included in the systematic review and 54 studies (n\u00a0=\u00a05017) were included in meta-analyses. Associations with depressive symptoms were significant for peripheral blood interleukin (IL)-6 (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35-0.82), I<sup>2</sup> \u00a0=\u00a057.9%; tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (SMD\u00a0=\u00a00.73; 95% CI, 0.35-1.11), I<sup>2</sup> \u00a0=\u00a074.1%; and C-reactive protein (CRP) (SMD\u00a0=\u00a00.57; 95% CI, 0.27-0.87), I<sup>2</sup> \u00a0=\u00a00%. IL-5, IL-13, albumin, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were associated with depressive symptoms but based on fewer studies. Most cancer settings were represented; the number of studies per inflammatory marker varied from 1 to 52.Although peripheral inflammatory markers were unevenly studied, the most studied markers (IL-6, TNF, and CRP) were associated with depressive symptoms in cancer patients and may be useful for management of depressive symptoms in the cancer setting.Peripheral blood inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF, and CRP) were associated with depressive symptoms in various cancer settings. Although further studies are warranted, these findings may help identify and manage depressive symptoms in patients with cancer."

We describe cancer-related nutrition and meal planning information from Pinterest.In June 2020, we searched Pinterest using \"cancer recipe\" and \"recipe for cancer\" at 3 times daily for 2 weeks. Duplicates were removed for a final sample of n = 103 pins. Each pin was coded for 58 variables including descriptives, cancer claims (eg, treatment, prevention, and cure), and nutrition claims (eg, \"turmeric cures cancer\"). We summarized each variable to describe the content of cancer nutrition claims on Pinterest and examined associations between claim types and contextual factors, including the use of academic citations, disclaimers, and personal anecdotes.Pinners had on average 116,767 followers (range, 0-1.5 million). Almost half of content sites were for profit (48.5%) and 34% were selling a product. Health claims were common, with content that purported to prevent (41.8%), treat (27.2%), or cure (10.7%) cancer. Vague phrases such as \"anti-cancer,\" \"cancer-fighting,\" or \"cancer-busting\" were also used. The inclusion of validity indicators including academic citations, disclaimers, and personal anecdotes varied significantly by the types of claims made. Together, these analyses informed the development of a conceptual framework of cancer-related nutrition misinformation.There are clear financial incentives for the promotion of cancer nutrition information online. More research is needed to understand how exposure to nutrition information can influence patient/caregiver behavior and downstream clinical and psychosocial outcomes."

We evaluated the incidences of metachronous colorectal neoplasms following curative colorectal cancer segmental resection (SR) vs ER in patients with HNPCC and investigated patients' oncologic outcomes according to surgical modality and mismatch repair status.We retrospectively investigated medical records of patients with HNPCC (per the Amsterdam II criteria) treated for primary colon cancer at our institution between 2001 and 2017. All patients underwent intensive endoscopic surveillance.We included 87 patients (36 who underwent SR and 51 who underwent ER). The cumulative incidence of metachronous adenoma was higher in the SR group. One patient in the SR group (2.8%) and 3 in the ER group (5.9%) developed metachronous colon cancer; the difference was not significant (P\u2009=\u20090.693). Four patients in the SR group (11.1%) and 1 in the ER group (2.0%) developed distant recurrences; again, the difference was not significant (P\u2009=\u20090.155). Moreover, no significant differences were observed in the 5-year overall survival rates of patients in the SR and ER groups (88.2% vs 95.5%, P\u2009=\u20090.446); the same was true for 5-year disease-free survival rates (79.5% vs 91.0%, P\u2009=\u20090.147).The incidence of metachronous cancer was not significantly different between the ER and SR groups; however, that of cumulative metachronous adenoma was higher in the SR group. Hence, intensive surveillance colonoscopy may be sufficient for patients with HNPCC after non-extensive colon resection."

    "title": "Implementing patient navigation programs: Considerations and lessons learned from the Alliance to Advance Patient-Centered Cancer Care.",
    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Six multidisciplinary cancer centers were selected and funded by the Merck Foundation (2017-2021) to collaborate in the Alliance to Advance Patient-Centered Cancer Care (\"Alliance\"), an initiative to improve patient access, minimize health disparities, and enhance the quality of patient-centered cancer care. These sites share their insights on implementation and expansion of their patient navigation efforts.Patient navigation represents an evidence-based health care intervention designed to enhance patient-centered care and care coordination. Investigators at 6 National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers outline their approaches to reducing health care disparities and synthesize their efforts to ensure sustainability and successful transferability in the management of patients with cancer and their families in real-world health care settings.Insights are outlined within the context of patient navigation program effectiveness and supported by examples from Alliance cancer center sites: 1) understand the patient populations, particularly underserved and high-risk patients; 2) capitalize on the existing infrastructure and institutional commitment to support and sustain patient navigation; and 3) build capacity by mobilizing community support outside of the cancer center.This process-level article reflects the importance of collaboration and the usefulness of partnering with other cancer centers to share interdisciplinary insights while undergoing intervention development, implementation, and expansion. These collective insights may be useful to staff at other cancer centers that look to implement, enhance, or evaluate the effectiveness of their patient navigation interventions."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Given the major changes in internet use for health communication, the objective of the current study was to compare the internet use and wishes of cancer survivors between 2005 and 2017.The authors drew a sample of 390 patients in 2005 and 539 patients in 2017 who were diagnosed with breast (128 patients in 2005 and 143 patients in 2017), prostate (96 patients in 2005 and 126 patients in 2017), or gynecologic (89 patients in 2005 and 188 patients in 2017) cancer or lymphoma (77 patients in 2005 and 82 patients in 2017) in 4 different hospitals for the periods 2002 through 2004 and 2014 through 2016. These patients were sent a paper-based questionnaire that contained 45 questions regarding demographics and 4 functions of internet use: content, communication, community, and e-health.The response in 2017 (53%) was lower than that in 2005 (75%). Survivors browsed the internet most frequently to search for information regarding cancer shortly after being diagnosed and while waiting for treatment. There was little change noted with regard to the relative importance attached to the various subjects. In 2017, significant increases were evident with regard to finances (+33%), health care insurance (+29%), and genetics and/or heritability (+27%). The wishes expressed in 2005 by patients were realized in part in 2017.A significant sample of cancer survivors in the Netherlands have indicated that the internet is an important source of information regarding their illness. However, little change was evident over the past 15\u00a0years with regard to patients' priorities regarding their wishes for internet use. The wishes of users in 2005 were found to accurately reflect the internet use of the majority of patients in 2017. The results of the current study support the belief that health care professionals should expand their online services and tailor them toward the needs and wishes of their patients."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Young adult cancer survivors experience frailty and decreased muscle mass at rates equivalent to much older noncancer populations, which indicate accelerated aging. Although frailty and low muscle mass can be identified in survivors, their implications for health-related quality of life are not well understood.Through a cross-sectional analysis of young adult cancer survivors, frailty was assessed with the Fried frailty phenotype and skeletal muscle mass in relation to functional and quality of life outcomes measured by the Medical Outcomes Survey Short-Form 36 (SF-36). z tests compared survivors with US population means, and multivariable linear regression models estimated mean SF-36 scores by frailty and muscle mass with adjustments made for comorbidities, sex, and time from treatment.Sixty survivors (median age, 21\u00a0years; range, 18-29) participated in the study. Twenty-five (42%) had low muscle mass, and 25 were either frail or prefrail. Compared with US population means, survivors reported worse health and functional impairments across SF-36 domains that were more common among survivors with (pre)frailty or low muscle mass. In multivariable linear modeling, (pre)frail survivors (vs nonfrail) exhibited lower mean scores for general health (-9.1; P\u00a0=\u00a0.05), physical function (-14.9; P\u00a0<\u00a0.01), and overall physical health (-5.6; P\u00a0=\u00a0.02) independent of comorbid conditions.Measures of frailty and skeletal muscle mass identify subgroups of young adult cancer survivors with significantly impaired health, functional status, and quality of life independent of medical comorbidities. Identifying survivors with frailty or low muscle mass may provide opportunities for interventions to prevent functional and health declines or to reverse this process.Young adult cancer survivors age more quickly than peers without cancer, which is evidenced by a syndrome of decreased resilience known as frailty. The relationship between frailty (and one of its common components, decreased muscle mass) and quality of life among young adult cancer survivors was examined. Measuring decreased muscle mass and frailty identifies young survivors with poor quality of life, including worse general health, fatigue, physical function, and overall physical health, compared with nonfrail survivors. Interventions to address components of frailty (low muscle mass and weakness) may improve function and quality of life among young adult cancer survivors."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Despite the biopsychosocial underpinnings of chronic noncancer pain, relatively little is known about the contribution of psychosocial factors to chronic cancer pain. The authors aimed to characterize associations between biopsychosocial factors and pain and opioid use among individuals with chronic pain and cancer.The authors conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional study of 700 patients with chronic pain and cancer seeking treatment at an academic tertiary pain clinic. Patients completed demographic questionnaires and validated psychosocial and pain measures. Multivariable, hierarchical linear and logistic regressions assessed the relative contributions of biopsychosocial factors to the primary dependent variables of pain severity, pain interference, and opioid use.Participants were 62% female and 66% White with a mean age of 59 \u00b1 15 years, and 55% held a college degree or higher. Older age, African American or \"other\" race, sleep disturbance, and pain catastrophizing were significantly associated with higher pain severity (F(5,657) = 22.45; P \u2264 .001; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.22). Depression, sleep disturbance, pain catastrophizing, lower emotional support, and higher pain severity were significantly associated with pain interference (F(5,653) = 9.47; P \u2264 .001; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.44). Lastly, a poor cancer prognosis (Exp(B) = 1.62) and sleep disturbance (Exp(B) = 1.02) were associated with taking opioids, whereas identifying as Asian (Exp(B) = 0.48) or Hispanic (Exp(B) = 0.47) was associated with lower odds of using opioids.Modifiable psychological factors-specifically sleep disturbance, depression, and pain catastrophizing-were uniquely associated with pain and opioid use in patients with chronic pain and diverse cancer diagnoses. Future behavioral pain interventions that concurrently target sleep may improve pain among patients with cancer.Feeling depressed, worrying about pain, and bad sleep are related to higher pain symptoms in individuals with chronic pain and cancer. Specifically, those who struggle to sleep have worse pain and use more opioids. Also, individuals who have a bad prognosis for their cancer are more likely to be using opioid pain medications. Although race and cancer are related to chronic pain in patients, psychological well-being is also strongly related to this same pain."

    "content": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries collaborate to provide annual updates on cancer occurrence and trends in the United States and to address a special topic of interest. Part I of this report focuses on national cancer statistics, and part 2 characterizes progress in achieving select Healthy People 2020 cancer objectives.For this report, the authors selected objectives-including death rates, cancer screening, and major risk factors-related to 4 common cancers (lung, colorectal, female breast, and prostate). Baseline values, recent values, and the percentage change from baseline to recent values were examined overall and by select sociodemographic characteristics. Data from national surveillance systems were obtained from the Healthy People 2020 website.Targets for death rates were met overall and in most sociodemographic groups, but not among males, blacks, or individuals in rural areas, although these groups did experience larger decreases in rates compared with other groups. During 2007 through 2017, cancer death rates decreased 15% overall, ranging from -4% (rural) to -22% (metropolitan). Targets for breast and colorectal cancer screening were not yet met overall or in any sociodemographic groups except those with the highest educational attainment, whereas lung cancer screening was generally low (<10%). Targets were not yet met overall for cigarette smoking, recent smoking cessation, excessive alcohol use, or obesity but were met for secondhand smoke exposure and physical activity. Some sociodemographic groups did not meet targets or had less improvement than others toward reaching objectives.Monitoring trends in cancer risk factors, screening test use, and mortality can help assess the progress made toward decreasing the cancer burden in the United States. Although many interventions to reduce cancer risk factors and promote healthy behaviors are proven to work, they may not be equitably applied or work well in every community. Implementing cancer prevention and control interventions that are sustainable, focused, and culturally appropriate may boost success in communities with the greatest need, ensuring that all Americans can access a path to long, healthy, cancer-free lives."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Cancer and its treatment damage the musculoskeletal system and induce neurotoxicity, affecting the key sensory inputs for maintaining balance. The present study describes the pattern of balance impairment and evaluated its association with mortality among US cancer survivors.Data on a nationally representative sample of cancer survivors from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999 to 2015 was analyzed. Sensory-specific balance impairment was measured at baseline by the modified Romberg test of standing balance on firm and compliant support surfaces. The linked mortality data were updated through December 31, 2015.Among 511 cancer survivors, 282 (48.3%) had a balance impairment, predominantly attributing to vestibular dysfunction (251; 89.0% of 282 and 44.5% of 511). A higher prevalence of balance impairment was observed among cancer survivors with advanced age, lower socioeconomic status or educational attainment, body mass index <25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> , and an inactive lifestyle. During up to 16.4 years of follow-up (median, 11.3 years; 5088 person-years), 253 cancer survivors had died. Cancer survivors with a balance impairment had a 63% higher risk of death from all causes (hazard ratio, 1.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-2.38) after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, comorbidities, and cancer type. Specifically, those with vestibular dysfunctions had approximately 1.54 (95% CI, 1.05-2.27) times the risk of death compared to those without any balance impairment. These associations were stronger in males than in females.In a US nationally representative sample of cancer survivors, balance impairment and vestibular dysfunctions were prevalent and associated with heightened all-cause mortality."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "There is some evidence that place of residence is associated with cancer survival, but the findings are inconsistent, and the underlying mechanisms by which residential location might affect survival are not well understood. We conducted a systematic review of observational studies investigating the association of rural versus urban residence with cancer survival in high-income countries. We searched the Ovid Medline, EMBASE, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) databases up to May 31, 2016. Forty-five studies published between 1984 and 2016 were included. We extracted unadjusted and adjusted relative risk estimates with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Most studies reported worse survival for cancer patients living in rural areas than those in urban regions. The most consistent evidence, observed across several studies, was for colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer. Of the included studies, 18 did not account for socio-economic position. Lower survival for more disadvantaged patients is well documented; therefore, it could be beneficial for future research to take socio-economic factors into consideration when assessing rural/urban differences in cancer survival. Some studies cited differential stage at diagnosis and treatment modalities as major contributing factors to regional inequalities in cancer survival. Further research is needed to disentangle the mediating effects of these factors, which may help to establish effective interventions to improve survival for patients living outside major cities."

    "content": "Nowadays, evaluation of the efficacy and the duration of treatment, in context of monitoring patients with solid tumors, is based on the RECIST methodology. With these criteria, resistance and/or insensitivity are defined as tumor non-response which does not allow a good understanding of the diversity of the underlying mechanisms. The main objective of the OncoSNIPE\u00ae collaborative clinical research program is to identify early and late markers of resistance to treatment.Multicentric, interventional study with the primary objective to identify early and / or late markers of resistance to treatment, in 600 adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic triple negative or Luminal B breast cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer or pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Patients targeted in this study have all rapid progression of their pathology, making it possible to obtain models for evaluating markers of early and / or late responses over the 2-year period of follow-up, and thus provide the information necessary to understand resistance mechanisms. To explore the phenomena of resistance, during therapeutic response and / or progression of the pathology, we will use a multidisciplinary approach including high-throughput sequencing (Exome-seq and RNAseq), clinical data, medical images and immunological profile by ELISA. Patients will have long-term follow-up with different biological samples, at baseline (blood and biopsy) and at each tumoral evaluation or tumoral progression evaluated by medical imaging. Clinical data will be collected through a dedicated Case Report Form (CRF) and enriched by semantic extraction based on the French ConSoRe (Continuum Soins Recherche) initiative, a dedicated Semantic Clinical Data Warehouse (SCDW) to cancer. The study is sponsored by Oncodesign (Dijon, France) and is currently ongoing.The great diversity of intrinsic or acquired molecular mechanisms involved in resistance to treatment constitutes a real therapeutic issue. Improving understanding of mechanisms of resistance of cancer cells to anti-tumor treatments is therefore a major challenge. The OncoSNIPE cohort will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of resistance and will allow to explore new mechanisms of actions and to discover new therapeutic targets or strategies making it possible to circumvent the escape in different types of cancer.Clinicaltrial.gov.

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Its high mortality rate results from lack of adequate and sensitive methods allowing for the detection of the early stages of the disease, as well as low efficiency of the treatment, caused by the cytotoxic drug resistance of cancer cells. Unfortunately, tumours are able to develop new pathways and protective mechanisms that allow them to survive toxic conditions of chemotherapy. Therefore, intensive search for new genes and proteins involved in resistance to cytotoxic drugs is still needed, especially from a clinical point of view. The article presents an overview of the available literature on the role of semaphorin 3A (SEMA3A), protocadherin 9 (PCDH9), and S100 calcium binding protein A3 (S100A3) in carcinogenesis and chemoresistance of various tumors including ovarian cancer. As it turns out, the role of described genes/proteins is not limited only to their native biological activity but they function also as an oncogenic or suppressor factors in the tumor development. Moreover, they can also play an important role in development of drug resistance, as it was shown in ovarian cancer cell lines."

This study aimed to examine the validity of self-reported diagnosis of cancer among the JNHS cohort members (N=15,019).For women who reported any diagnosis of five cancers (stomach, colorectal, liver, lung and thyroid) in the biennial follow-up surveys, an additional outcome survey, medical facility survey, and confirmation of death certificate (DC) were conducted. The JNHS Validation Study Committee (referred to as \"the committee\") made a final decision on the reported outcomes. To examine the validity of self-reported diagnosis of cancer, the positive predictive value (PPV) was calculated using the committee's decision as the gold standard. To examine the validity of the committee's decision based on self-reports and DCs, PPV was calculated using physician-reported information as the gold standard.The PPV of self-reported diagnosis in the biennial follow-up surveys was 77.8% for stomach, 66.2% for colorectal, 41.7% for liver, 60.2% for lung, and 64.6% for thyroid cancer. The corresponding PPVs in the additional outcome survey were 96.2%, 80.7%, 62.5%, 82.5%, and 96.9%, respectively. The PPV of the committee's decision was 100% for stomach, 87.5% for colorectal, 94.7% for lung, and 100% for thyroid cancer (data not available for liver cancer). The proportion of DC-only cases among committee-defined cases was below 10% for all cancers except liver cancer (28.6%).The validity of identifying cancer diagnosis based on self-reported information in the JNHS was favorable for stomach, colorectal, lung and thyroid cancer."

Descriptive statistics, \u03c7<sup>2</sup> statistics, and t tests were used to compare nonclinical (eg, community health worker) and clinical (eg, nurse navigators) navigators on the provision of various navigation services, personal characteristics, engagement in the cancer care continuum, and program characteristics.Most participants were clinical navigators (76.1%). Compared to nonclinical navigators, clinical navigators were more likely to have a bachelor's degree or higher (88.6% vs 69.6%, P < .001), be funded by operational budgets (84.4% vs 35.7%, P < .001), and less likely to work at a community-based organization or nonprofit (2.0% vs 36.5%, P < .001). Clinical navigators were more likely to perform basic navigation (P < .001), care coordination (P < .001), treatment support (P < .001), and clinical trial/peer support (P = .005). Clinical navigators were more likely to engage in treatment (P < .001), end-of-life (P < .001), and palliative care (P = .001) navigation.There is growing indication that clinical and nonclinical oncology navigators perform different functions and work in different settings. Nonclinical navigators may be more likely to face job insecurity because they work in nonprofit organizations and are primarily funded by grants."

Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to examine the association of new statin use in the 12 months after a breast cancer diagnosis with overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS).When examining incident statin use, defined as the initiation of statin therapy in the 12 months after breast cancer diagnosis, a significant association was observed between statin use and improved BCSS (standardized hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20-0.88; P = .022) and OS (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.50-0.99; P = .046) among patients with TNBC (n = 1534). No association was observed with BCSS (standardized hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.71-1.39; P = .97) or OS (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.92-1.17; P = .55) among those without TNBC (n = 15,979). The results were consistent when examining statin exposure as a time-varying variable.Among women with I, II, and III TNBC, initiation of statin therapy in the 12 months after breast cancer diagnosis was associated with an OS and BCSS benefit. Statins may have a role in select patients with breast cancer, and further investigation is warranted."

The authors examined whether practices that became ACOs altered their spending for patients with cancer in the first 4 years after ACO implementation.By using national Medicare data from 2011 to 2017, a random sample of 20% of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older with cancer was obtained (n = 866,532), and each patient was assigned to a practice. Practices that became ACOs in the Medicare Shared Savings Program were matched to non-ACO practices. Total, cancer-specific, and service category-specific yearly spending per patient was calculated. A difference-in-differences model was used to determine spending changes associated with ACO status for patients with cancer in the 4 years after ACO implementation.The introduction of ACOs did not have a significant impact on overall spending for patients with cancer in the 2 years after ACO implementation (difference, -$38; 95% CI, -$268, $191; P = .74). Changes in spending also did not differ between ACO and non-ACO patients within service categories or among the 11 cancer types examined. The lack of difference in spending for patients with cancer in ACO and non-ACO practices persisted in the third and fourth years after ACO implementation (difference, -$120; 95% CI, -$284, $525; P = .56).ACOs did not significantly change spending for patients with cancer in the first 4 years after their implementation compared with non-ACOs. This prompts a reevaluation of the current efficacy of ACOs in reducing spending for cancer care and may encourage policymakers to reconsider the incentive structures of ACOs.Accountable care organizations (ACOs) were developed to curtail health care spending and improve quality, but their effects on cancer spending in their first 2 years have been minimal. The long-term impact of ACOs on cancer spending remains unknown. By using data from 866,532 Medicare beneficiaries with cancer, the authors observed that the association of a practice with an ACO did not significantly change total yearly spending per patient in the first 4 years after ACO implementation. This finding prompts a reevaluation of the current efficacy of ACOs in reducing spending for cancer care."

In Caucasians, compared to the carrier rate of 3.15% (12\u2009357/392274) in noncancer subjects, the rate was significantly higher in cancer patients overall (2621/79619 = 3.29%), especially in patients with colorectal cancer (247/6667 = 3.70%), cancers of gallbladder and biliary tract (21/351 = 5.98%), thyroid cancer (30/665 = 4.51%) and unspecified non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (74/1805 = 4.10%), all P \u2264\u2009.05. In contrast, the carrier rate in patients with cancers of lung and bronchus was significantly lower (89/3463 = 2.57%), P =\u2009.05. The association of CFTR F508del carriers with these types of cancer remained significant after adjusting for respective cancer-specific risk factors. For pancreatic cancer, although a higher carrier rate (38/1004 = 3.78%) was found in patients with this cancer, the difference was not statistically significant (P\u2009= .26). This null association was unlikely due to lack of statistical power; the large sample size of our study had >80% power, at a significance level of .05, to detect an association of >1.5-fold increased risk. In conclusion, the identified associations of CFTR F508del carriers with multiple types of cancer may have potential biological and clinical implications if confirmed in independent study populations."

The purpose of our study was to analyse the cancer stage distribution data of Georgia as a first step towards identifying the areas of early cancer detection in the country that might need improvement or require further research.Descriptive analysis of the population-based cancer registry of Georgia was performed using the data for the period of 01.01.2018-31.12.2019.Around 57\u00a0% of cancers in males and 56\u00a0% of cancers in females were amenable to early detection. At least 35.7\u00a0% of these cancers in males and 44.2\u00a0% in females were detected early. 15.2\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a0964) of male and 35.3\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a03179) of female cancer patients met the age criteria for the respective cancer screening programmes. Breast, colorectal, cervical and stomach cancers contributed to 58.7\u00a0% of all late-stage cancers in females. Lung, prostate, colorectal, laryngeal and stomach cancers made up 72.4\u00a0% of all late-stage cancer cases among males. At least 83.8\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a01438) of thyroid cancers in females and 84.2\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a0246) of thyroid cancers in males were diagnosed at stage I. Moreover, stage I thyroid cancer cases made up 50.7\u00a0% of all stage I cancer cases detected in women and 25.6\u00a0% of all stage I cancers in men. At least 42.4\u00a0% of stage I thyroid cancers in females and 37.4\u00a0% of stage I thyroid cancers in males were papillary microcarcinomas.The potential of early cancer detection is underutilised in Georgia and there is a need to strengthen screening and especially early diagnosis in the country. The possibility of thyroid cancer overdiagnosis requires further investigation."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Young adult (YA) cancer survivors are at risk for financial toxicity during and after cancer treatment. Financial toxicity has been associated with medical-related cost-coping behaviors such as skipping or delaying treatment. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in dire economic consequences that may worsen financial hardship among young survivors.This was a cross-sectional survey; data collection occurred online. A convenience sample was recruited through YA cancer advocacy groups and social media. Negative economic events associated with the COVID-19 pandemic (eg, income loss, increased debt, and decreased job security) and medical-related cost-coping were documented. A validated measure assessed cancer-related financial toxicity.Participants (N = 212) had a mean age of 35.3 years at survey completion and a mean age of 27.4 years at diagnosis. Financial toxicity (mean, 14.0; SD, 9.33) was high. Two-thirds of the sample experienced at least 1 negative economic event during COVID-19, and 71% engaged in at least 1 medical cost-coping behavior. Cost-coping and pandemic-related negative economic events were significantly correlated with cancer-related financial toxicity. In multivariable analyses, pandemic-related negative economic events and financial toxicity were associated with cost-coping.Acute negative economic events associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate cancer-related financial toxicity and overall financial hardship among YAs and lead to cost-coping behaviors that can compromise survivorship care and health outcomes. Multilevel, systematic interventions are needed to address the financial needs of YA survivors after the global pandemic."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Obesity is associated with a substantial health and economic burden in the general population in the United States. This study estimates the excess health care utilization and medical spending associated with overweight and obesity among long-term cancer survivors.Long-term cancer survivors (\u22652 years after their diagnosis) aged \u226518 years (N = 12,547) were identified from the nationally representative 2008-2016 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. A 2-part modeling approach was used to calculate the average annual care utilization and spending by service type. Excess care utilization and spending associated with overweight (25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> \u2264 body mass index [BMI] < 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> ), obesity (BMI \u2265 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> ), and severe obesity (BMI \u2265 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> ), in comparison with normal weight (18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> \u2264 BMI < 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> ), were estimated.Compared with normal-weight cancer survivors, overweight survivors had comparable care utilization and medical spending; survivors with obesity had an additional $3216 (95% CI, $1940-$4492) of medical spending, including $1243 (95% CI, $417-$2070) on hospital inpatient services and $1130 (95% CI, $756-$1504) on prescriptions per person per year. The excess annual medical spending associated with obesity among long-term cancer survivors translated to $19.7 billion in 2016 in the United States. The excess medical spending was magnified in cancer survivors with severe obesity ($5317 [95% CI, $2849-$7785], which translated to $6.7 billion in 2016). Excess care utilization and medical spending were mostly explained by comorbid conditions related to obesity.For long-term cancer survivors, obesity was associated with increased health care utilization and substantial excess medical spending. This suggests that policies and practices promoting a healthy lifestyle and achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight for cancer survivors may reduce their health care utilization and economic burden."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Data from a nationwide sample of US breast cancer survivors were used to examine associations between patient characteristics (breast cancer clinical features, prognostic factors, and treatments) and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Associations between postdiagnosis HRQOL and mortality were then evaluated.The authors identified female breast cancer survivors (n = 2453) from the Sister Study or Two Sister Study who were at least 1 year from breast cancer diagnosis and who had responded to a survivorship survey in 2012. HRQOL was assessed with the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global 10 measures. Multivariable linear regression was used to assess predictors associated with HRQOL. Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between HRQOL and all-cause mortality.HRQOL, assessed an average of 4.9 years after the cancer diagnosis (standard deviation of 1.9 years), was negatively associated with a higher cancer stage at diagnosis; a higher comorbidity score at the survey; experience of surgical complications; dissatisfaction with breast surgery; and experience of any recent recurrence, metastasis, or secondary malignancy. Since the completion of the survey, there were 85 deaths (3.5%) during a mean follow-up of 4 years (standard deviation of 0.5 years). In multivariate models, decreases in PROMIS physical T scores and mental T scores were associated with increased mortality (HR for physical T scores, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.05-1.11; HR for mental T scores, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06).Prognostic and cancer treatment-related factors affect HRQOL in breast cancer survivors and may inform targeted survivorship care. PROMIS global health measures may offer additional insights into patients' well-being and mortality risk.Findings from a study suggest that prognostic and cancer treatment-related factors affect health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in breast cancer survivors and that poor HRQOL may increase the mortality risk. The evaluation of HRQOL is important because it may hold potential as a tool for optimizing survivorship care."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Childhood cancer survivors (CCS) are at risk of developing subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMNs) resulting from exposure to prior therapies. CCS with underlying cancer predisposition syndromes are at additional genetic risk of SMN development. The McGill Interactive Pediatric OncoGenetic Guidelines (MIPOGG) tool identifies children with cancer at increased likelihood of having a cancer predisposition syndrome, guiding clinicians through a series of Yes or No questions that generate a recommendation for or against genetic evaluation. We evaluated MIPOGG's ability to predict SMN development in CCS.Using the provincial cancer registry (Ontario, Canada), and adopting a nested case-control approach, we identified CCS diagnosed and/or treated for a primary malignancy before age 18 years (1986-2015). CCS who developed an SMN (cases) were matched, by primary cancer and year of diagnosis, with CCS who did not develop an SMN (controls) over the same period (1:5 ratio). Potential predictors for SMN development (chemotherapy, radiation, and MIPOGG output) were applied retrospectively using clinical data pertaining to the first malignancy. Conditional logistic regression models estimated hazard ratios and 95% CIs associated with each covariate, alone and in combination, for SMN development.Of 13,367 children with a primary cancer, 317 (2.4%) developed an SMN and were matched to 1,569 controls. A MIPOGG output recommending evaluation was significantly associated with SMN development (hazard ratio 1.53; 95% CI, 1.06 to 2.19) in a multivariable model that included primary cancer therapy exposures. MIPOGG was predictive of SMN development, showing value in nonhematologic malignancies and in CCS not exposed to radiation.MIPOGG has additional value for SMN prediction beyond treatment exposures and may be beneficial in decision making for enhanced individualized SMN surveillance strategies for CCS."

    "content": "Cancer survivors develop other chronic medical conditions because of shared risk factors and delayed effects of cancer treatment. This study investigated trends in the prevalence of chronic diseases and estimated their population sizes among adult cancer survivors in the United States from 2002 to 2018.Using 2002-2018 National Health Interview Survey data, this study calculated the age-sex-race/ethnicity-adjusted prevalences and estimated the population sizes for the following chronic conditions among cancer survivors: hypertension, diabetes, stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/asthma, hepatitis, arthritis, liver disease, kidney disease, and morbid obesity. This study also examined multiple chronic conditions (MCC; 3 or more health conditions). MCC trends were further examined by sociodemographic factors to identify high-risk populations. Parallel analyses were performed for participants without a cancer history to provide a reference.Among 30,728 cancers survivors, increasing trends were observed in the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease, and morbid obesity, whereas decreasing prevalence trends were observed for ischemic heart disease, COPD, and hepatitis. Cancer survivors with MCC increased from 4.7 million in 2002 to 8.1 million in 2018 (the prevalence increased from 43.7% to 46.6%). The increase was more pronounced among survivors aged 18 to 44 years. Among adults without a cancer history, the MCC prevalence also increased, although more slowly than among survivors.The number of adult cancer survivors in the United States with comorbid illnesses has increased substantially over the past 2 decades. Optimal management of comorbid conditions and aggressive interventions for risk reduction may benefit the cancer survivor population."

    "content": "There is a lack of evidence-based recommendations for the age at which women with a family history of cancers other than breast cancer should start breast cancer screening.Using Swedish family cancer data sets, the authors conducted a nationwide cohort study including 5,099,172 Swedish women born after 1931 (follow-up, 1958-2015). Accounting for calendar time, they calculated the relative risk of breast cancer for women with a family history of a discordant cancer in 1 first-degree relative. Furthermore, the authors used 10-year cumulative risk to determine the ages at which women with a family history of discordant cancer reached risk thresholds at which women in the general population were recommended to start breast cancer screening.A family history of cancer at 15 sites was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Among women younger than 50 years, the highest risk of breast cancer was observed for those with a family history of ovarian cancer (standardized incidence ratio, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-1.64). In these women, the risk of breast cancer associated with a family history at other cancer sites ranged from 1.08-fold for prostate cancer to 1.18-fold for liver cancer. When breast cancer screening was recommended to be started at the age of 50 years for the general population, women with 1 first-degree relative with ovarian cancer attained the threshold risk for screening at the age of 46 years. Women with a family history of other discordant cancers did not reach the risk thresholds for screening at younger ages.Many cancers showed familial associations with breast cancer, but women with a family history of these cancers (except for ovarian cancer) did not reach risk thresholds for screening at younger ages."

The primary analysis was the risk that an SMN would occur \u2265 5 years after the original diagnosis for patients who had the more common AYA cancers (leukemia, lymphoma, testicular malignancy, ovarian malignancy, melanoma, and cancers of the thyroid, breast, soft tissue, or bone). The standardized incidence ratio (SIR), absolute excess risk (AER), and cumulative incidence of SMN for the selected cancers were assessed. The risk of SMN for the entire cohort also was analyzed.Of the 148,558 AYA survivors who were diagnosed with a selected cancer, 7384 developed an SMN 5 years after their original diagnosis. The SIRs (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were 1.58 (95% CI, 1.55-1.62) for AYAs, 4.26 (95% CI, 3.77-4.80) for children, and 1.10 (95% CI, 1.09-1.11) for older adults, and the AERs were 22.9, 16.6, and 14.7, respectively. The cumulative incidence of SMN at 30 years was 13.9% for the AYA group. The most common SMNs in AYAs were breast cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, genital cancers, and melanoma. AYAs who had received radiation therapy had a higher cumulative incidence of SMN.AYAs who survive cancer for more than 5 years have a higher relative risk of SMN compared with the general population and have a higher absolute risk of SMN compared with younger or older cancer survivors."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Cancer-related cognitive impairment is a prevalent, disruptive condition potentially exacerbated by sleep disturbances. The current study was performed to evaluate the effects of acupuncture versus cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) on objective and subjective cognitive function in cancer survivors with insomnia.Using data from a randomized clinical trial (160 survivors) that compared acupuncture versus CBT-I for insomnia occurring in cancer survivors, the authors analyzed cognitive outcomes and their relationship to insomnia symptoms. Analysis was limited to 99 patients who reported baseline cognitive difficulties. Interventions were delivered over 8\u00a0weeks. Objective attention, learning, and memory were evaluated using the Buschke Selective Reminding Test. Subjective cognitive function was assessed using the Brown Attention-Deficit Disorder Scales. Insomnia symptoms were assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index. All outcomes were collected at baseline, week 8, and week 20.From baseline to week 8, acupuncture produced statistically significant within-group improvements in objective attention (Cohen D, 0.29), learning (Cohen D, 0.31), and memory (Cohen D, 0.33) that persisted to week 20 (all P\u00a0<\u00a0.05), whereas CBT-I produced a statistically significant within-group improvement in objective attention from baseline to week 20 (Cohen D, 0.50; P\u00a0<\u00a0.05); between-group differences were not statistically significant. Both interventions produced statistically significant within-group improvements in subjective cognitive function at weeks 8 and 20 compared with baseline (all P\u00a0<\u00a0.001); between-group differences were not statistically significant. In the acupuncture group, patients with clinically meaningful responses with regard to insomnia symptoms demonstrated a significantly greater improvement in subjective cognitive function compared with those without clinically meaningful insomnia responses (P\u00a0=\u00a0.006).Among cancer survivors with insomnia, both acupuncture and CBT-I produced significant improvements in objective and subjective cognitive function. However, the effect sizes varied and only survivors in the acupuncture group demonstrated a significant relationship between cognitive and sleep outcomes. These preliminary findings warrant further investigation to guide the personalized management of patients with cancer-related cognitive impairment."

Patients with cancer are particularly susceptible to the disease, and their treatment plans have been threatened by public health restrictions designed to contain the spread.This study examined the effects of the pandemic on cancer patients' psychology, knowledge, attitudes, and practices concerning COVID-19 as well as their perceptions of the impact of COVID-19 on their cancer health care services. A survey was sent to 5800 patients at a cancer center in Toronto, Canada. Descriptive results were summarized. Qualitative feedback was coded and summarized. To examine for potential associations, regression models were tested for the outcomes of patient psychological well-being, knowledge, attitudes, and practices, and they accounted for several demographic, health literacy, and disease variables.A total of 1631 surveys were completed. Most patients saw their appointments shifted to virtual visits, and for a substantial minority, there was no change. A majority of the patients (62%) expressed fears about contracting the virus. There were no independent predictors of COVID-19-related knowledge. Fears were more pronounced among patients who did not speak English and those who used social media more often. Female participants, those who scored higher on knowledge questions, and those who used cancer center materials were more likely to take preventative measures against infection.This study provides a snapshot of the state of cancer patient treatment and the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of patients between the first 2 waves of the pandemic. The study's results can inform our understanding of adaptation to conditions during and after the outbreak."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Previous studies have described suicidal ideation among survivors of childhood cancer, but small numbers of events limit the understanding of suicide risk. The objectives of this study were to assess whether childhood cancer survivors are at increased risk of suicide in comparison with the general population and to determine risk factors associated with risk in a population-based cohort.First primary malignancies among individuals aged 0 to 19 years from 1975 to 2016 were identified from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) databases. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) of suicide were obtained via SEER*Stat software from SEER 9. Fine and Gray proportional hazards models were used to identify suicide-associated factors among childhood cancer patients included in SEER 18.In all, 96,948 childhood cancer cases and 89 suicides were identified. Across all attained ages, the suicide risk for individuals with a childhood cancer history (11.64 per 100,000 person-years) was similar to the risk for those without a cancer history (SMR, 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91-1.43). However, for survivors alive beyond the age of 28 years (the median age of death by suicide), the suicide risk was significantly elevated (suicides per 100,000 person-years, 22.43; SMR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.02-1.87). Females (hazard ratio, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.18-0.59; P < .01) had lower risks than males.These results suggest that long-term childhood cancer survivors may be at increased suicide risk. Male sex is an independent risk factor for suicide. However, the absolute risk of suicide in older survivors is still low at ~1 per 5000 person-years. Future efforts should identify survivorship strategies to mitigate suicide risk."

Little is known about the late-effect information needs of AYAs early in treatment or their role in treatment decision making. This study evaluated the importance, quality, and implications of information about late effects in AYAs recently diagnosed with cancer.This study surveyed 201 AYAs with cancer who were 15 to 29\u00a0years old and were treated at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (Boston, Massachusetts). Patients were approached within 6\u00a0weeks of their diagnosis and were asked about their late-effect and infertility information needs, treatment decision making, and communication outcomes.Forty-five percent of the participants were female; 88% were white. Most AYAs (87% [173 of 200]) considered information about the risks of late effects to be extremely or very important; 80% (159 of 200) valued information about infertility. Many were distressed by information about late effects (53% [105 of 200]) and infertility (45% [89 of 200]); those who considered late-effect information distressing were more likely to value this information (P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). Consideration of late effects (41% [82 of 201]) and infertility (36% [72 of 201]) greatly influenced many patients' treatment decision making. Although 92% of the patients (184 of 199) reported receiving high-quality information about the diagnosis, 57% (113 of 199; P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001) and 65% (130 of 199; P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001) felt that they had received high-quality information about late effects and infertility, respectively.Most AYAs with cancer value early information about the risks of late effects and infertility, yet many patients felt that they had not received high-quality information about these topics. The development of age-appropriate late-effect communication strategies that recognize high AYA distress may help to address the gap between desired information and perceived information quality."

In this study, a population-based data set of patients diagnosed with cancer and enrolled in Medicaid was created and evaluated. The objective was to compare the characteristics of patients with cancer identified in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data and linked to the Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) Personal Summary files with the characteristics of patients who were not linked to the MAX file.All persons in 14 SEER registries diagnosed with cancer from 2006 to 2013 who were or were not linked to the 2006-2013 nationwide MAX files were selected, and patient demographic characteristics were compared for 3 age groups. Common cancer sites and the timing of Medicaid enrollment with respect to patients' cancer diagnoses were reported, and the stage at diagnosis and 4-year mortality were compared by 3 categories of Medicaid enrollment.Approximately 18% of the sample was enrolled in Medicaid within 25 months of diagnosis. Enrollees had a greater proportion of racial/ethnic minorities in comparison with patients who were not enrolled. A late-stage diagnosis was more common among Medicaid patients and particularly among those who enrolled after their diagnosis. For every common cancer site, mortality was highest in the sample of Medicaid patients who enrolled after their diagnosis.The Medicaid enrollment data newly added to SEER records enhance researchers' ability to investigate research questions related to Medicaid policies and care delivery. For patients enrolled before their diagnosis, Medicaid appears to offer protection against late-stage disease and mortality."

However, whether these patients are at high risk for neoplasms other than lung cancer and mesothelioma remains inconclusive.To examine whether patients with pneumoconiosis have a higher incidence of malignant neoplasms other than lung cancer.We conducted a cohort study using the medical records of patients with pneumoconiosis who visited our two hospitals from 1 January 1991 through 31 December 2017. We identified the occurrence of malignant neoplasms and calculated the incidences and standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) compared with those of the general population.One hundred and seventy patients with pneumoconiosis (163 men, 7 women) including 142 patients with silicosis, 24 with asbestosis and 4 with pneumoconiosis were identified. The mean age was 66.8 years. The proportion of smokers was 79%. Forty-seven malignant neoplasms occurred. Most malignant neoplasms were lung cancer (n = 22), while some were digestive cancers such as gastric cancer (n = 9), oesophageal cancer (n = 3) and colorectal cancer (n = 3). Participants presented increased risks for lung cancer (SIR: 10.86, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.15-16.49), gastric cancer (SIR: 2.55, 95% CI: 1.22-5.35) and oesophageal cancer (SIR: 5.78, 95% CI: 1.86-17.92).Compared with the general population, patients with pneumoconiosis had an increased risk of malignant neoplasms of the digestive system in addition to lung cancer. Clinicians should consider testing for digestive system cancers as well as for lung cancers in these patients."

Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to identify which factors were associated with COVID-19 mortality.Three hundred and six SARS-CoV-2-positive cancer patients were included. Seventy-one had mild/moderate and 29% had severe COVID-19. Seventy-two patients died of COVID-19 (24%), of whom 35 died <7 days. Male sex [hazard ratio (HR): 1.97 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.15-3.38)], Asian ethnicity [3.42 (1. 59-7.35)], haematological cancer [2.03 (1.16-3.56)] and a cancer diagnosis for >2-5 years [2.81 (1.41-5.59)] or \u22655 years were associated with an increased mortality. Age >60 years and raised C-reactive protein (CRP) were also associated with COVID-19 death. Haematological cancer, a longer-established cancer diagnosis, dyspnoea at diagnosis and raised CRP were indicative of early COVID-19-related death in cancer patients (<7 days from diagnosis).Findings further substantiate evidence for increased risk of COVID-19 mortality for male and Asian cancer patients, and those with haematological malignancies or a cancer diagnosis >2 years. These factors should be accounted for when making clinical decisions for cancer patients."

We analysed the odds of advanced stage of cancer as a flexible function of the length of primary care interval (days from first presentation to referral) and secondary care interval (days from referral to diagnosis), respectively, using logistic regression with restricted cubic splines.The association between time intervals and stage was similar for each type of cancer. A statistically significant U-shaped association was seen between the secondary care interval and the diagnosis of advanced rather than localised cancer, odds decreasing from the first day onwards and increasing around three and a half months. A different pattern was seen for the primary care interval, flat trends for colorectal and lung cancers and a slightly curved association for ovarian cancer, although not statistically significant.The results confirm previous findings that some cancers may progress even within the relatively short time frame of regulated diagnostic intervals. The study supports the current emphasis on expediting symptomatic diagnosis of cancer."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "The enrollment of Black patients in cancer clinical trials continues to trend far below the true prevalence of disease in Black patients in the United States, limiting the generalizability of trial results. A potentially overlooked contributor to the underenrollment of Black patients may be the increasing enrollment of cancer trials in countries outside the United States. However, the impact of the globalization of cancer clinical trials on recruitment of racial minority patients has been understudied.In this study, race and accrual location data for all cancer drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 2015 and 2018 were analyzed. A disparity score was calculated for each approval, a metric comparing Black enrollment in clinical trials with the estimated burden of disease in Black patients.Of 49 global clinical trials supporting 35 FDA drug approvals with race data available, Black patients accounted for 2.5% of enrollment (range, 0%-10%), with a median disparity score of 0.19 (range, 0.01-0.98). In 21 clinical trials supporting 18 FDA drug approvals with both race and accrual location data available, 64% patients were enrolled outside the United States (range, 0%-100%). Black patients accounted for 3.2% of enrollment (range, 0.2%-10%), and the median disparity score was 0.23 (range, 0.01-0.98). There was a significant inverse correlation between the proportion of trial patients enrolled outside the United States and the disparity score (Pearson correlation, -0.61; P = .007).The globalization of cancer clinical trials is associated with a widening racial enrollment disparity gap in the United States. The impact of global trials on domestic clinical trial generalizability warrants further consideration from a regulatory and policy standpoint.Black patients continue to be underrepresented in cancer clinical trials; this disparity has worsened in recent years perhaps because of the globalization of cancer clinical trials. In an analysis of demographic information from 21 cancer clinical trials leading to US Food and Drug Administration approvals between 2015 and 2018, clinical trials conducted primarily outside the United States were 2-fold less likely to enroll Black participants than US clinical trials. Thus, the globalization of cancer clinical trials may have the unintended consequence of further exacerbating existing racial disparities in cancer clinical trial representation and ultimately the generalizability of trial results."

Associations with cancer mortality are not well studied, and whether associations are similar across race is unknown.We conducted a prospective analysis of 12 997 cancer-free participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study who were never users at visit 1 (1987-1989). Ever use, duration of use, and age at first use were modeled as time-dependent variables using Cox regression to estimate associations with total, obesity- and smoking-associated, bladder, breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer incidence and mortality.We ascertained 3869 cancer cases and 1661 cancer deaths in 237 999 or more person-years. At 6 years of follow-up, 70.8% of lipid-lowering drug use was a statin. Compared with never use, ever use was associated with lower total, obesity- and smoking-associated cancer mortality and with colorectal cancer mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.32 to 0.79) and incidence (HR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.53 to 0.92).

First use at age 60 years or older was inversely associated with: total mortality, obesity- and smoking-associated mortality, and colorectal cancer mortality; and total incidence, obesity- and smoking-associated incidence, and breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer incidence.This study provides additional evidence for inverse associations between lipid-lowering drug use and cancer incidence and mortality but a positive association with bladder cancer incidence in men. Evaluation of the impact of chemoprevention strategies that include lipid-lowering drugs on population-level cancer burden is needed."

    "content": "Specialised follow-up care after cancer treatment is changing towards increased involvement of general practice. To ensure timely detection of new cancer events, knowledge is warranted on the timing of cancer recurrence (CR) and second primary cancer (SPC), including risk factors for CR.This population-based register study included 67,092 patients diagnosed with malignant melanoma, bladder, lung, ovarian, endometrial, colorectal and breast cancer in Denmark in 2008-2016. The time from primary cancer to CR or SPC and risk factors for prolonged time to CR were analysed and stratified on sex and primary cancer type.Cancer recurrence proportions ranged from 6% to 35%. The risk of CR increased profoundly within the first 3\u00a0years and then levelled off, except for breast cancer. A total of 3%-6% of patients had SPC, with monotonously increasing cumulative incidence proportions. Besides primary tumour characteristics, lower educational level, living alone and comorbidity were associated with earlier CR. For example, in female malignant melanoma, HRs and 95% confidence intervals were 0.47 (0.37-0.61) for high educational level, 1.40 (1.16-1.68) for living alone and 2.38 (1.53-3.70) for high comorbidity.The results may inform stratified risk assessment in decision of frequency, location and duration of post-cancer follow-up care."

    "content": "People living with HIV (PLWH) are at an increased risk of developing several cancers, but to the authors' knowledge less is known regarding how HIV impacts the rate of progression to advanced cancer or death.The authors compared stage of disease at the time of presentation and mortality after diagnosis between 14,453 PLWH and 6,368,126 HIV-uninfected patients diagnosed with cancers of the oral cavity, stomach, colorectum, anus, liver, pancreas, lung, female breast, cervix, prostate, bladder, kidney, and thyroid and melanoma using data from the National Cancer Data Base (2004-2014). Polytomous logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to evaluate the association between HIV, cancer stage, and stage-adjusted mortality after diagnosis, respectively. Regression models accounted for the type of health facility at which cancer treatment was administered and the type of individual health insurance.HIV-infected patients with cancer were found to be more likely to be uninsured (HIV-infected: 5.0% vs HIV-uninfected: 3.3%; P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001) and were less likely to have private health insurance (25.4% vs 44.7%; P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). Compared with those not infected with HIV, the odds of being diagnosed at an advanced stage of disease were significantly elevated in PLWH for melanoma and cancers of the oral cavity, liver, female breast, prostate, and thyroid (odds ratio for stage IV vs stage I range, 1.24-2.06). PLWH who were diagnosed with stage I to stage III disease experienced elevated mortality after diagnosis across 13 of the 14 cancer sites evaluated, with hazard ratios ranging from 1.20 (95% CI, 1.14-1.26) for lung cancer to 1.85 (95% CI, 1.68-2.04), 1.85 (95% CI, 1.51-2.27), and 2.93 (95% CI, 2.08-4.13), respectively, for cancers of the female breast, cervix, and thyroid.PLWH were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced-stage cancers and to experience elevated mortality after a cancer diagnosis, even after accounting for health care-related factors."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Published studies regarding patient navigation (PN) and cancer were reviewed to assess quality, determine gaps, and identify avenues for future research. The PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched for studies investigating the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of PN across the cancer continuum. Each included article was scored independently by 2 separate reviewers with the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. The current review identified 113 published articles that assessed PN and cancer care, between August 1, 2010, and February 1, 2018, 14 of which reported on the cost-effectiveness of PN programs. Most publications focused on the effectiveness of PN in screening (50%) and diagnosis (27%) along the continuum of cancer care. Many described the effectiveness of PN for breast cancer (52%) or colorectal cancer outcomes (51%). Most studies reported favorable outcomes for PN programs, including increased uptake of and adherence to cancer screenings, timely diagnostic resolution and follow-up, higher completion rates for cancer therapy, and higher rates of attending medical appointments. Cost-effectiveness studies showed that PN programs yielded financial benefits. Quality assessment showed that 75 of the 113 included articles (65%) had 2 or more weak components. In conclusion, this review indicates numerous gaps within the PN and cancer literature where improvement is needed. For example, more research is needed at other points along the continuum of cancer care outside of screening and diagnosis. In addition, future research into the effectiveness of PN for understudied cancers outside of breast and colorectal cancer is necessary along with an assessment of cost-effectiveness and more rigorous reporting of study designs and results in published articles."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Fatigue is a common and distressing symptom for patients with gynecologic cancers. Few studies have empirically examined whether it spontaneously resolves. This study was aimed at identifying longitudinal patterns of fatigue and predictors of clinically significant fatigue 1\u00a0year after treatment completion.This was a prospective cohort study of women with newly diagnosed ovarian (n\u00a0=\u00a081) or endometrial cancer (n\u00a0=\u00a0181) that did not progress or recur within 1\u00a0year of treatment completion. Symptoms of fatigue, depression, and anxiety were assessed after surgery and 6 and 12\u00a0months after treatment completion with the Fatigue Assessment Scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Patients' fatigue scores over time were classified (scores of 22-50, clinically significant; scores of 10-21, not clinically significant). Logistic regression models were fit to examine associations between fatigue and patient characteristics.Among 262 participants, 48% reported clinically significant fatigue after surgery. One year later, 39% reported fatigue. There were 6 patterns over time: always low (37%), always high (25%), high then resolves (18%), new onset (10%), fluctuating (6%), and incidental (5%). Patients with fatigue after surgery were more likely to report fatigue at 12\u00a0months in comparison with others (odds ratio [OR], 6.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.82-13.11; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Patients with depressive symptoms also had higher odds of fatigue (OR, 3.36; 95% CI, 1.08-10.65; P\u00a0=\u00a0.039), although only one-third of fatigued patients reported depressive symptoms.Nearly half of women with gynecologic cancers had clinically significant fatigue after surgery, whereas 44% and 39% had fatigue 6\u00a0months and 1\u00a0year later; this suggests that spontaneous regression of symptoms is relatively rare. Women who reported fatigue, depressive symptoms, or 2 or more medical comorbidities had higher odds of reporting fatigue 1\u00a0year later. Future studies should test scalable interventions to improve fatigue in women with gynecologic cancers."

    "content": "Patients with cancer history are usually excluded from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) clinical trials. However, whether previous malignancy affects the oncological outcomes of HCC patients has not been fully assessed. This study aimed to evaluate whether prior cancer compromised the survival of HCC patients.Patients with HCC were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database between 2004 and 2015, and then they were classified into groups with and without prior cancer. The Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression analysis were adopted to evaluate whether prior cancer impacted clinical outcomes after propensity score matching (PSM) adjusting baseline differences. Validation was performed in the cohort from our institution.We identified 2642 HCC patients with prior cancer. After PSM, the median overall survival (OS) time were 14.5 and 12.0\u2009months respectively for groups with and without prior cancer. Prior cancer did not compromise prognosis in patients with HCC (p\u2009=\u20090.49). The same tendency was found in subgroups stratified by tumor stages and cancer interval period: OS was similar between groups with and without prior cancer (both p values>\u20090.1). In the multivariate Cox regression model, prior cancer did not adversely impact patients' survival (HR: 1.024; 95% CI: 0.961-1.092). In the validation cohort from our institution, prior cancer had no significant association with worse outcomes (p\u2009=\u20090.48).For HCC patients, prior cancer did not compromise their survival, regardless of tumor stage and cancer interval period. Exclusion criteria for HCC clinical trials could be reconsidered."

Data on cancer deaths during 2001 through 2017 were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics' National Vital Statistics System. Trends in incidence and death rates for all cancers combined and for the leading cancer types by sex, racial/ethnic group, and age were estimated by joinpoint analysis and characterized by the average annual percent change during the most recent 5\u00a0years (2012-2016 for incidence and 2013-2017 for mortality).Overall, cancer incidence rates decreased 0.6% on average per year during 2012 through 2016, but trends differed by sex, racial/ethnic group, and cancer type. Among males, cancer incidence rates were stable overall and among non-Hispanic white males but decreased in other racial/ethnic groups; rates increased for 5 of the 17 most common cancers, were stable for 7 cancers (including prostate), and decreased for 5 cancers (including lung and bronchus [lung] and colorectal). Among females, cancer incidence rates increased during 2012 to 2016 in all racial/ethnic groups, increasing on average 0.2% per year; rates increased for 8 of the 18 most common cancers (including breast), were stable for 6 cancers (including colorectal), and decreased for 4 cancers (including lung). Overall, cancer death rates decreased 1.5% on average per year during 2013 to 2017, decreasing 1.8% per year among males and 1.4% per year among females. During 2013 to 2017, cancer death rates decreased for all cancers combined among both males and females in each racial/ethnic group, for 11 of the 19 most common cancers among males (including lung and colorectal), and for 14 of the 20 most common cancers among females (including lung, colorectal, and breast). The largest declines in death rates were observed for melanoma of the skin (decreasing 6.1% per year among males and 6.3% among females) and lung (decreasing 4.8% per year among males and 3.7% among females). Among children younger than 15\u00a0years, cancer incidence rates increased an average of 0.8% per year during 2012 to 2016, and cancer death rates decreased an average of 1.4% per year during 2013 to 2017. Among adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 39\u00a0years, cancer incidence rates increased an average of 0.9% per year during 2012 to 2016, and cancer death rates decreased an average of 1.0% per year during 2013 to 2017.Although overall cancer death rates continue to decline, incidence rates are leveling off among males and are increasing slightly among females. These trends reflect population changes in cancer risk factors, screening test use, diagnostic practices, and treatment advances. Many cancers can be prevented or treated effectively if they are found early. Population-based cancer incidence and mortality data can be used to inform efforts to decrease the cancer burden in the United States and regularly monitor progress toward goals."

    "title": "Exemptions to state laws regulating opioid prescribing for patients with cancer-related pain: A summary.",
    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Cancer-related pain is highly prevalent and is commonly treated with prescription opioids. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now encourages conservative opioid prescribing in recognition of potential opioid-related risks. However, CDC guidelines have been misapplied to patients with cancer. Recent laws at the state level reflect the CDC's guidance by limiting opioid prescribing. It is unclear whether states exempt cancer-related pain, which may affect cancer pain management. Thus, the objective of this study was to summarize current state-level opioid prescribing laws and exemptions for patients with cancer.Two study authors reviewed publicly available state records to identify the most recent opioid prescribing laws and cancer-related exemptions. Documents were required to have the force of law and be enacted at the time of the search (November 2020).Results indicated that 36 states had enacted formal legislation limiting the duration and/or dosage of opioid prescriptions, and this was largely focused on acute pain and/or initial prescriptions. Of these states, 32 (89%) explicitly exempted patients with cancer-related pain from opioid prescribing laws. Exemptions were broadly applied, with few states providing specific guidance for cancer-related pain prescribing.The results of this study indicate that most states recognize the importance of prescription opioids in cancer-related pain management. However, drafting nuanced and clinically relevant opioid legislation is challenging for a heterogenous population. Additionally, current attempts to regulate opioid prescribing by state law may unintentionally undermine patient-centered approaches to pain management. Additional resources are needed to facilitate clarity at the intersection of opioid-related legislation and clinical management for cancer-related pain.In this review of state-level legislation, current limitations on opioid prescribing are summarized and detailed information is provided on exemptions for patients with cancer. The majority of states have enacted specific dosage and/or duration limitations on opioid prescribing while including broad exemptions for cancer-related pain. Cancer-related pain exemptions are important to include, as is consistent with national and professional guidelines (eg, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). However, these exemptions may also unintentionally undermine patient-centered approaches to pain management. Additional resources, including specific guidance for patients with cancer, are needed to facilitate clarity at the intersection of opioid-related legislation and clinical pain management. \u200b."

    "content": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b32 gene Pro12Ala allele polymorphism (<i>PPARG2</i> Pro12Ala; rs1801282) has been linked to both cancer risk and dietary factors. We conducted the first systematic literature review of studies published before December 2020 using the PubMed database to summarize the current evidence on whether dietary factors for cancer may differ by individuals carrying C (common) and/or G (minor) alleles of the <i>PPARG2</i> Pro12Ala allele polymorphism. The inclusion criteria were observational studies that investigated the association between food or nutrient consumption and risk of incident cancer stratified by <i>PPARG2</i> Pro12Ala allele polymorphism. From 3815 identified abstracts, nine articles (18,268 participants and 4780 cancer cases) covering three cancer sites (i.e., colon/rectum, prostate, and breast) were included. CG/GG allele carriers were more impacted by dietary factors than CC allele carriers. High levels of protective factors (e.g., carotenoids and prudent dietary patterns) were associated with a lower cancer risk, and high levels of risk factors (e.g., alcohol and refined grains) were associated with a higher cancer risk. In contrast, both CG/GG and CC allele carriers were similarly impacted by dietary fats, well-known PPAR-\u03b3 agonists. These findings highlight the complex relation between <i>PPARG2</i> Pro12Ala allele polymorphism, dietary factors, and cancer risk, which warrant further investigation."

Several studies demonstrate disparities in end-of-life care among immigrant populations in the United States. This study aimed to evaluate how immigrant status affects location and quality of death among patients with advanced cancer in the United States.Data were derived from Coping with Cancer, a federally funded multi-site prospective study of advanced cancer patients and caregivers. The sample of patients who died during the study period was weighted (N<sub>w</sub> \u00a0=\u00a0308) to reduce statistically significant differences between immigrant (N<sub>w</sub> \u00a0=\u00a049) and nonimmigrant (N<sub>w</sub> \u00a0=\u00a0259) study participants. Primary outcomes were location of death, death at preferred location, and poor QoD.Analyses adjusted for covariates indicated that patients who were immigrants were more likely to die in a hospital than home (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 3.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.65-6.71) and less likely to die where they preferred (AOR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.20-0.90). Furthermore, immigrants were more likely to have poor QoD (AOR, 5.47; 95% CI, 2.70-11.08).Immigrants, as compared to nonimmigrants, are more likely to die in hospital settings, less likely to die at their preferred location, and more likely to have poor QoD.Cancer patients typically prefer to die in their own homes, which is associated with improved quality of death. However, disparities in end-of-life care among immigrant populations in the United States remain significant. Our study found that immigrants are less likely to die in their preferred locations and more likely to die in hospital settings, resulting in poorer quality of death."

Our objective was to examine the impact of the benefit coverage expansion policy on healthcare utilization and overall survival (OS) among patients with six types of solid cancer after the policy of expanding health insurance coverage.This study analyzed a before-and-after retrospective cohort of patients newly diagnosed with six types of solid cancer (stomach cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer) from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2015 in Korea. The intervention was the expansion of reimbursement in 2013. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the policy effect.In total, 142,579 before and 147,760 patients after the benefit expansion, and after matched by age, gender, and stage, 132,440 before and 132,440 patients after policy were included in the analysis. Almost total medical expenditure increased for five types of cancer increased. The expansion of health insurance reimbursement was associated with significantly lower overall mortality compared with pre-policy mortality for all six cancer sites.The policy of expanding health insurance reimbursement might have been associated with a significant increase in survival among cancer patients by ensuring access to health care and medicine. Although the reimbursement expansion timing differs for each cancer, it is believed that eliminating delayed treatment might rather lead to reduce medical expenses and improve health outcomes."

Studies on computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) using deep learning or machine learning are on the increase. However, studies with small sample sizes are limited by inadequate statistical strength. Here, we used a meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) of CAD algorithms of esophageal cancers or neoplasms using endoscopic images.Core databases were searched for studies based on endoscopic imaging using CAD algorithms for the diagnosis of esophageal cancer or neoplasms and presenting data on diagnostic performance, and a systematic review and DTA meta-analysis were performed.Overall, 21 and 19 studies were included in the systematic review and DTA meta-analysis, respectively. The pooled area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio of CAD algorithms for the diagnosis of esophageal cancer or neoplasms in the image-based analysis were 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95-0.99), 0.94 (95% CI, 0.89-0.96), 0.88 (95% CI, 0.76-0.94), and 108 (95% CI, 43-273), respectively. Meta-regression showed no heterogeneity, and no publication bias was detected. The pooled area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio of CAD algorithms for the diagnosis of esophageal cancer invasion depth were 0.96 (95% CI, 0.86-0.99), 0.90 (95% CI, 0.88-0.92), 0.88 (95% CI, 0.83-0.91), and 138 (95% CI, 12-1569), respectively.CAD algorithms showed high accuracy for the automatic endoscopic diagnosis of esophageal cancer and neoplasms. The limitation of a lack in performance in external validation and clinical applications should be overcome."

Discrete time survival analyses were used to estimate baseline (wave 1) predictors (physical health status, mental health status, pain, and demographic variables) on past-year engagement with cannabis within individuals who reported a cancer diagnosis at wave 1 (n = 1022) and individuals who reported never having cancer at any wave (n = 19,702).At the most recent survey, 8% of cancer survivors reported past-year cannabis use, compared with 15% of those without a cancer history. Across 4 time points, an estimated 3.8% of cancer survivors engaged with cannabis, as compared to 6.5% of those without a cancer history. Across both groups, older age and having health insurance were associated with lower likelihood of engaging in cannabis use, whereas greater levels of pain were associated with higher likelihood of engaging in cannabis use. Among those without a cancer history, being female, White, and having better mental health status were associated with lower likelihood of engaging in cannabis use.Although cannabis use prevalence is lower among cancer survivors, the reasons for use are not markedly different from those without a cancer history. Continued monitoring of use, reasons for use, and harms or benefits is warranted.Results from this study, which uses data from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study, indicate that cannabis use is generally increasing across cancer survivors and those without a history of cancer. Cancer survivors are using cannabis at slightly lower rates than those without a history of cancer. Factors related to pain seem to be more prevalent in cancer populations relative to the general population, and could be contributing to cannabis use within cancer survivor populations."

    "content": "Hereditary pancreatic cancer, which includes patients with familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) and hereditary pancreatic cancer syndromes, accounts for about 10% of all pancreatic cancer diagnoses. The early detection of pre-cancerous pancreatic cysts has increasingly become a focus of interest in recent years as a potential avenue to lower pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality. Intraductal papillary mucinous cystic neoplasms (IPMNs) are recognized precursor lesions of pancreatic cancer. IPMNs have high prevalence in patients with hereditary pancreatic cancer and their relatives. While various somatic mutations have been identified in IPMNs, certain germline mutations associated with hereditary cancer syndromes have also been identified in IPMNs, suggesting a role in their formation. While the significance for the higher prevalence of IPMNs or similar germline mutations in these high-risk patients remain unclear, IPMNs do represent pre-malignant lesions that need close surveillance. This review summarizes the available literature on the incidence and prevalence of IPMNs in inherited genetic predisposition syndromes and FPC and speculates if IPMN and pancreatic cancer surveillance in these high-risk individuals needs to change."

Pathology reports could potentially identify cancer recurrences. Their utility to capture recurrences is unknown.This analysis assesses the sensitivity of pathology reports to identify patients with cancer recurrence and the stage at recurrence.The study includes patients with recurrent breast (n=214) or colorectal (n=203) cancers.This retrospective analysis included patients from a population-based cancer registry who were part of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research (PCOR) Study, a project that followed cancer patients in-depth for 5 years after diagnosis to identify recurrences.Information abstracted from pathology reports for patients with recurrence was compared with their PCOR data (gold standard) to determine what percent had a pathology report at the time of recurrence, the sensitivity of text in the report to identify recurrence, and if the stage at recurrence could be determined from the pathology report.One half of cancer patients had a pathology report near the time of recurrence. For patients with a pathology report, the report's sensitivity to identify recurrence was 98.1% for breast cancer cases and 95.7% for colorectal cancer cases. The specific stage at recurrence from the pathology report had a moderate agreement with gold-standard data.Pathology reports alone cannot measure population-based recurrence of solid cancers but can identify specific cohorts of recurrent cancer patients. As electronic submission of pathology reports increases, these reports may identify specific recurrent patients in near real-time."

    "content": "To estimate trends in the crude probability of death for cancer patients by sex, age and spread of disease over the past 30\u00a0years in New South Wales, Australia.Population-based cohort of 716,501 people aged 15-89\u00a0years diagnosed with a first primary cancer during 1985-2014 were followed up to 31 December 2015. Flexible parametric relative survival models were used to estimate the age-specific crude probability of dying from cancer and other causes by calendar year, sex and spread of disease for all solid tumours combined and cancers of the colorectum, lung, female breast, prostate and melanoma.Estimated 10-year sex, age and spread-specific crude probabilities of cancer death generally decreased over time for most cancer types, although the magnitude of the decrease varied. For example, out of 100 fifty-year old men with localized prostate cancer, 12 would have died from their cancer if diagnosed in 1985 and 3 in 2014. Greater degree of spread was consistently associated with higher probability of dying from cancer, although outcomes for lung cancer were consistently poor. For both males and females, the probability of non-cancer deaths was higher among older patients, those diagnosed with localized cancers and where cancer survival was higher.Crude probabilities presented here may be useful in helping clinicians and their patients better understand prognoses and make informed decisions about treatment. They also provide novel insights into the relative contributions that early detection and improved treatments have on the observed temporal patterns in cancer survival."

The objective was to assess COVID-19 mortality rates in patients with cancer versus patients without cancer and uncover possible statistically significant characteristics contributing to mortality.This retrospective study analyzed patients with cancer and patients without cancer who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from March 1 through April 30, 2020. This was a multicenter study in the state of Louisiana throughout the Ochsner Health System in both tertiary and nontertiary centers. Patients older than 18 years were eligible. Three hundred twelve patients with cancer were compared with 4833 patients without cancer.Mortality was found to be higher in the cancer group. Patients of advanced age with cancer had a significant increase in mortality (odds ratio [OR], 5.96; P < .001). Other significant risk factors for increased mortality were male sex (OR, 2.15), a history of chronic kidney disease (OR, 3.84), and obesity (OR, 1.30). In hospitalized patients with cancer, adverse vital signs on admission, decreased absolute lymphocyte counts, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, lactic acidosis, and elevated procalcitonin all seemed to increase the risk of death. Among patients with cancer, active or progressive disease (P < .001) and recent therapy (OR, 2.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-5.08) were shown to increase mortality.Patients with cancer have increased mortality in the setting of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with patients without cancer. Patients with cancer who are 65 years of age or older and those with certain comorbidities have the greatest risk of death. Recent cancer-directed therapy and disease status also seem to play roles in mortality.This is the largest study of patients with cancer versus patients without cancer to date and is the first multivariate analysis study comparing these 2 patient populations. This study confirms the hypothesis that patients with cancer are at increased risk for mortality and that there are multiple characteristics posing the potential to risk-stratify these patients in the setting of a future outbreak."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "The objective of this study was to ascertain long-term cancer survivors' (LTCS') appraisal of medical care and how these perceptions may influence their health and well-being, including benefit finding (BF) and posttraumatic growth (PTG).In total, 6952 LTCS from a multiregional population-based study in Germany completed the Benefit Finding Scale, the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory, the Questionnaire on Stress in Cancer, and self-designed questions on cognitive appraisal of medical care. The authors explored the mediating role of distress between medical care appraisal and BF and PTG and the possible moderation of time since diagnosis in this relationship.LTCS' medical care appraisals (\"no unresolved/untreated symptoms,\" \"satisfaction with cancer care,\" and \"satisfaction with care for other diseases\") were positively associated with BF. PTG was positively associated with \"no unresolved/untreated symptoms\" and negatively associated with \"satisfaction with care for other diseases.\" Cancer distress partially mediated the associations between appraisals of medical care and BF, between \"no unresolved/untreated symptoms\" and PTG and between \"satisfaction with care for other diseases\" and PTG; whereas it totally mediated the association between \"satisfaction with cancer care\" and PTG. Time was a significant moderator in the model; the negative indirect effect of cognitive appraisal on BF and PTG through cancer distress weakened with longer time since diagnosis.Cancer survivors' medical care appraisal is associated with their perceptions of BF and PTG through distress. Therefore, distress screening could be part of the regular workup to identify distressed cancer survivors who are not satisfied with medical care; these survivors may benefit from interventions to reduce distress and increase BF and PTG."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Despite recommendations for reflex immunohistochemistry (IHC) for mismatch repair (MMR) proteins to identify Lynch syndrome (LS), the uptake of genetic assessment by those who meet referral criteria is low. The authors implemented a comprehensive genetic navigation program to increase the uptake of genetic testing for LS in patients with endometrial cancer (EC) or nonserous/nonmucinous ovarian cancer (OC).Participants with newly diagnosed EC or OC were prospectively recruited from 3 cancer centers in Ontario, Canada. Family history questionnaires were used to assess LS-specific family history. Reflex IHC for MMR proteins was performed with the inclusion of clinical directives in pathology reports. A trained genetic navigator initiated a genetic referral on behalf of the treating physician and facilitated genetic referrals to the closest genetics center.A total of 841 participants (642 with EC, 172 with OC, and 27 with synchronous EC/OC) consented to the study; 194 (23%) were MMR-deficient by IHC. Overall, 170 women (20%) were eligible for a genetic assessment for LS: 35 on the basis of their family history alone, 24 on the basis of their family history and IHC, 82 on the basis of IHC alone, and 29 on the basis of clinical discretion. After adjustments for participants who died (n = 6), 149 of 164 patients (91%) completed a genetic assessment, and 111 were offered and completed genetic testing. Thirty-four women (4.0% of the total cohort and 30.6% of those with genetic testing) were diagnosed with LS: 5 with mutL homolog 1 (MLH1), 9 with mutS homolog 2 (MSH2), 15 with mutS homolog 6 (MSH6), and 5 with PMS2.The introduction of a navigated genetic program resulted in a high rate of genetic assessment (>90%) in patients with gynecologic cancer at risk for LS."

    "content": "Cancer outcomes for Medicaid enrollees may be affected by patients' primary care (PC) utilization and complex Medicaid enrollment dynamics, which have recently changed for many states under the Affordable Care Act.With New Jersey State Cancer Registry and linked Medicaid claims data, a retrospective cohort study was conducted for patients with incident breast, colorectal, or invasive cervical cancer (aged 21-64 years) diagnosed in 2012-2014. Associations of Medicaid enrollment factors and PC utilization with the stage at diagnosis and treatment delays were examined with multivariate logistic regression models.The study included 19,209 total cancer cases and 3253 linked Medicaid cases. Medicaid cases were more likely to be diagnosed at a late stage and to experience treatment delays in comparison with non-Medicaid cases. In adjusted analyses, Medicaid cases with 1 or more PC visits before the diagnosis had lower odds of a late-stage diagnosis (odds ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.67) in comparison with Medicaid cases with no outpatient visits. New enrollees (<6 months) and longer term enrollees in fee-for-service (FFS) Medicaid had greater odds of a late-stage diagnosis and treatment delays in comparison with those in Medicaid managed care.Medicaid patients with cancer diagnosed just before and in the initial year of eligibility expansion had worse outcomes than non-Medicaid cases. Poor outcomes were especially pronounced among new enrollees, those without outpatient visits before their diagnosis, and FFS enrollees. Targeted strategies to enhance care continuity, including access to PC providers before the diagnosis and a better understanding of pathways to cancer care upon Medicaid enrollment, are needed to improve outcomes in this population."

The authors aimed to evaluate the characteristics of patients with cancer admitted through the ED and determine whether cancer types are related to in-hospital mortality.The National Emergency Department Information System database of patients visiting EDs in South Korea between 2016 and 2017 was analyzed. Among 6,179,088 adult patients who presented to an ED with nontraumatic medical illness, patients with cancer were identified. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality.Patients with cancer accounted for 6.8% of ED visits, and 239,630 patients (57.0%) were admitted to the hospital (intensive care unit [ICU], 9.5%; others, 90.5%). The prevalent cancers requiring hospitalization were lung cancer (15.7%), liver cancer (14.2%), and colon cancer (11.6%). The commonest reasons for admission other than cancer-related medical problems (41.4%) were pneumonia (4.8%) and hepatobiliary infection (2.8%). Overall in-hospital mortality was 16.1% (ICU, 28.3%; general wards, 14.8%); lung cancer (22.9%), liver cancer (19.7%), and leukemia/multiple myeloma (17.8%) showed the highest mortality rates. The highest odds for mortality were for lung cancer (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.227; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.124-2.335; P < .001) and liver cancer (adjusted OR, 1.839; 95% CI, 1.751-1.930; P < .001), which were referenced to genitourinary cancer by multivariable logistic regression analysis.More than half of the patients with cancer visiting EDs were admitted to the hospital with a mortality rate of 16.1%. Physicians treating patients with cancer and policymakers and planners designing health systems should understand the different prevalences and outcomes of oncological emergencies by cancer type to improve patient care."

    "content": "Patients with cancer have a higher risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) than noncancer patients. The authors conducted a multicenter retrospective study to investigate the clinical manifestations and outcomes of patients with cancer who are diagnosed with COVID-19.The authors reviewed the medical records of hospitalized patients who were treated at 5 hospitals in Wuhan City, China, between January 5 and March 18, 2020. Clinical parameters relating to cancer history (type and treatment) and COVID-19 were collected. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Secondary analyses were the association between clinical factors and severe COVID-19 and OS.A total of 107 patients with cancer were diagnosed with COVID-19, with a median age of 66\u00a0years (range, 37-98\u00a0years). Lung (21 patients; 19.6%), gastrointestinal (20 patients; 18.7%), and genitourinary (20 patients; 18.7%) cancers were the most common cancer diagnoses. A total of 37 patients (34.6%) were receiving active anticancer treatment when diagnosed with COVID-19, whereas 70 patients (65.4%) were on follow-up. Overall, 52.3% of patients (56 patients) developed severe COVID-19; this rate was found to be higher among patients receiving anticancer treatment than those on follow-up (64.9% vs 45.7%), which corresponded to an inferior OS in the former subgroup of patients (hazard ratio, 3.365; 95% CI, 1.455-7.782 [P\u00a0=\u00a0.005]). The detrimental effect of anticancer treatment on OS was found to be independent of exposure to systemic therapy (case fatality rate of 33.3% [systemic therapy] vs 43.8% [nonsystemic therapy]).The results of the current study demonstrated that >50.0% of infected patients with cancer are susceptible to severe COVID-19. This risk is aggravated by simultaneous anticancer treatment and portends for a worse survival, despite treatment for COVID-19."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Second malignant neoplasm is one of the most devastating late effects of childhood cancers. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence and survival outcomes of patients developing second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) after surviving childhood cancer in Korea.Medical data of childhood cancer patients diagnosed between 1993 and 2012 were obtained from the Korea Central Cancer Registry. The risk of developing SMNs was calculated using standardized incidence ratio (SIR), excess absolute risk (EAR), and cumulative risk. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were estimated, stratified by SMN status.A total of 28,405 childhood cancer patients were diagnosed in the study period, and 337 (1.2%) developed SMN. The total follow-up period was 197,359 person-years at risk (PYR), with a median follow-up duration of 5.6 years. Overall SIR was 20.0, which was 23.2 in women, and 17.6 in men. The overall EAR was 16.4 per 10,000 PYR. The most common types of SMNs, in order of incidence, were other malignant epithelial neoplasms, leukemia, and soft tissue sarcomas. The cumulative incidence of developing SMNs was 0.7% at 5 years, 1.2% at 10 years, and 2% at 15 years. After primary cancer diagnosis, the 10-year overall survival rate of patients with SMNs was 65.1%, which was lower than the 73.4% in patients without SMN. After SMN diagnosis, the 10-year overall survival rate was 55.8%.Through this registry-based study of 5.6 years of follow up, childhood cancer survivors were found to be at 20-fold higher risk of developing a malignant neoplasm compared to the general population. The majority of malignant neoplasms are malignant epithelial neoplasms, leukemia, and soft tissue sarcomas. Continued surveillance for assessing long-term risks, and guidance for appropriate long-term follow up of childhood cancer survivors, are needed."

    "content": "Adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors experience psychological distress often because of cancer and its treatment. However, no prior studies have evaluated the additional medical expenditures and health care utilization associated with psychological distress in AYA cancer survivors.AYA cancer survivors and a comparison matched group of adults with no history of cancer were identified from 2011-2016 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data. Medical expenditures and health care utilization were evaluated with multivariable regression models.AYA cancer survivors were more likely to have psychological distress (11.5% of 1757) than adults with no history of cancer (5.8% of 5227). The prevalence of psychological distress was found to be high many years after the diagnosis, with 11.2% reporting distress \u226520 years after their cancer diagnosis. AYA cancer survivors with psychological distress were more likely to smoke and have chronic conditions and were less likely to exercise regularly in comparison with AYAs with no history of psychological distress. AYA cancer survivors with psychological distress had additional annual medical expenses ($4415; 95% CI, $993-$9690), office visits (2.80; 95% CI, 0.23-6.15), and use of prescription medications/medication renewals (11.58; 95% CI, 5.70-19.47) in comparison with AYA cancer survivors without psychological distress. Additional annual medical expenses of psychological distress were $2600 higher in AYA cancer survivors than adults without a history of cancer ($1802; 95% CI, $440-$3791).These results highlight the substantial economic burden associated with psychological distress in AYA cancer survivors. This research could inform survivorship care plans and interventions addressing the psychological needs of AYA cancer survivors."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "The relationship between vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene variant rs699947 polymorphism and urologic neoplasms risk was studied extensively in recent years. The VEGF gene plays a key role in angiogenesis of urologic neoplasms, but some conclusions are still inconclusive. The aim of this study was to determine whether this polymorphism is a risk factor for susceptibility to urologic neoplasms by conducting a meta-analysis.We performed a meta-analysis of 15 different publications from the PubMed, Embase and Medline databases, to better assess the association between VEGF rs699947 polymorphism and urologic neoplasms risk. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were evaluated using random or fixed effects models.By pooling all eligible studies, we found that the VEGF rs699947 polymorphism was not associated with overall urologic neoplasms. However, subgroup analysis based on cancer types demonstrated that significantly increased association was found between VEGF rs699947 polymorphism and the risk of bladder cancer (BCa) under heterozygous genetic model (OR\u202f=\u202f1.48, 95%CI\u202f=\u202f1.17-1.89). And rs699947 polymorphism was also identified an increased risk of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) under dominant, recessive, homozygous, heterozygous and allelic contrast genetic models, while no association was observed in prostate cancer (PCa). In addition, in subgroup analysis by ethnicity, we found rs699947 polymorphism was associated with Asian population under dominant, homozygous, heterozygous and allelic contrast genetic models. No evidence of publication bias was found (Begg's test, P\u202f=\u202f0.855; Egger's test, P\u202f=\u202f0.590).In summary, our study showed evidence that the VEGF rs699947 polymorphism was obviously associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer and renal cell carcinoma, particularly in Asian population, while no significant association was observed in overall urologic neoplasms. Future studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to further evaluate these associations in more details."

    "content": "Sub-Saharan African-born blacks (ABs) are one of the fastest-growing populations in the United States. However, to the authors' knowledge, data regarding the cancer burden in this group are lacking, which would inform targeted cancer prevention and control.The authors calculated age-standardized proportional incidence ratios (PIRs) comparing the frequency of the top 15 cancers in ABs with that of US-born non-Hispanic blacks (USBs) by sex and region of birth using incidence data for 2000 through 2012 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER 17) program.Compared with USBs, ABs had significantly higher PIRs of infection-related cancers (liver, stomach, and Kaposi sarcoma), blood cancers (leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma), prostate cancer, and thyroid cancers (females only). For example, the PIR for Kaposi sarcoma in AB versus USB women was 12.06 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 5.23-18.90). In contrast, ABs had lower PIRs for smoking-related and colorectal cancers (eg, for lung cancer among men, the PIR was 0.30 [95% CI, 0.27-0.34]). Furthermore, cancer occurrence in ABs versus USBs varied by region of birth. For example, the higher PIRs for liver cancer noted among male ABs (PIR, 3.57; 95% CI, 1.79-5.35) and for thyroid cancer in female ABs (PIR, 3.03; 95% CI, 2.03-4.02) were confined to Eastern African-born blacks, whereas the higher PIR for prostate cancer (PIR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.78, 2.02) was confined to Western African-born blacks.The cancer incidence profile of ABs is different from that of USBs and varies by region of birth, suggesting differences in environmental, cultural, social, and genetic factors.

AAs continued to have higher mortality in 13 cancer types after adjustment for socioeconomic variables using the National Cancer Database (5,150,023 patients; 11.6% AA and 88.4% EA). Then, molecular features of 5,283 tumors were analyzed in patients who had genetic ancestry data available (87.2% EA and 12.8% AA). Genes were identified with altered DNA methylation along with increased microRNA expression levels unique to AA patients that are associated with cancer drug resistance. Increased miRNAs (miR-15a, miR-17, miR-130-3p, miR-181a) were noted in common among AAs with breast, kidney, thyroid, or prostate carcinomas.The current results identified epigenetic features in AA patients who have cancer that may contribute to higher mortality rates compared with EA patients who have cancer. Therefore, a focus on molecular signatures unique to AAs may identify actionable molecular abnormalities."

The intensity of financial hardship was estimated across 3 domains: 1) material, including conditions that arise from medical expenses; 2) behavioral, including coping behaviors to manage medical expenses; and 3) psychological hardship resulting from worries about medical expenses and insurance, as measured by the number of instances of each type of financial hardship (0, 1-2, and \u22653 instances). Multivariable logistic regressions were conducted to examine the clinical and sociodemographic predictors of experiencing financial hardship (0-2 vs \u22653 instances).The intensity of financial hardship did not significantly differ between survivors and siblings. Survivors reported more instances of material hardship than siblings (1-2 instances: 27.2% of survivors vs 22.6% of siblings; \u22653 instances: 15.9% of survivors vs 11.4% siblings; overall P = .03).

However, data on the relation of psychological distress to cancer screening is limited. The authors conducted a systematic review to assess psychological distress associated with cancer screening procedures.Studies that administered measures of psychological distress between 2 weeks before and 1 month after the screening procedure were included.In total, 22 eligible studies met criteria for review, including 13 observational trials and 9 randomized controlled trials. Eligible studies used a broad range of validated and unvalidated measures. Anxiety was the most commonly assessed construct and was measured using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory. Studies included breast, colorectal, prostate, lung, and cervical screening procedures. Distress was low across procedures, with the exception of colorectal screening. Distress did not vary according to the time at which distress was measured. None of the studies were conducted exclusively with the intention of assessing distress at the time of screening.Evidence of low distress during the time of cancer screening suggests that distress might not be a widespread barrier to screening among adults who undergo screening. However, more studies are needed using validated measures of distress to further understand the extent to which screening may elicit psychological distress and impede adherence to national screening recommendations.

The age-standardized incidence rate (ASR), annual percent change (APC), and relative survival were calculated.The ASR of total HNSCC decreased from 1999 to 2017 (APC, -0.2 [95% CI, -0.3 to -0.0]), as did the ASR of HPV-unrelated HNSCC (APC, -0.6 [95% CI, -0.8 to -0.5]); however, the ASR of HPV-related HNSCC increased (APC, 2.9 [95% CI, 2.5 to 3.2]). The rapidly increasing incidence of tonsil squamous cell carcinoma, which was the main subsite of HPV-related HNSCC, stabilized after 2011 (APC pre-2011, 6.8 [95% CI, 5.0 to 8.3]; APC post-2011, 1.6 [95% CI, -2.1 to 5.5]), and the difference was significant (P = .017). In contrast, oral cavity cancer incidence demonstrated the only increase among HPV-unrelated subsites, with the increase occurring after 2006 (APC pre-2006, 1.6 [95% CI, 0.3 to 2.8]; APC post-2006, 2.8 [95% CI, 2.2 to 3.5]); the main cause of this change was an increase in the ASR of tongue cancer.This study demonstrates the recent stabilization of tonsil cancer incidence and the contrasting increase in oral cavity cancer incidence, unlike other HPV-unrelated cancers. These trends require further surveillance and understanding in terms of tumor biology and prevention."

The impact of cancer on clinical outcomes in this patient population is unclear, as is the performance of the HAS-BLED (Hypertension, Abnormal Renal/Liver Function, Stroke, Bleeding History or Predisposition, Labile INR, Elderly, Drugs/Alcohol) and CHA<sub>2</sub> DS<sub>2</sub> -VASc (Congestive Heart Failure, Hypertension, Age \u2265 75 years, Diabetes Mellitus, Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack, Vascular Disease, Age 65 to 74 Years, Sex Category) scores.This was an observational, retrospective cohort study including 2,435,541 adults hospitalized with AF. The authors investigated the incidence rates (IRs) of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, ischemic stroke, major bleeding, and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) according to the presence of cancer and cancer types.Overall, 399,344 (16.4%) had cancer, with the most common cancers being metastatic, prostatic, colorectal, lung, breast, and bladder. During a mean follow-up of 2.0 years, cancer increased all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 2.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.99-2.01). The IR of ischemic stroke was higher with pancreatic cancer (2.8%/y), uterine cancer (2.6%/y), and breast cancer (2.6%/y), whereas it was lower with liver/lung cancer (1.9%/y) and leukemia/myeloma (2.0%/y), in comparison with noncancer patients (2.4%/y). Cancer increased the risk of major bleeding (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.26-1.28) and ICH (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.05-1.10). Leukemia, liver cancer, myeloma, and metastatic cancers showed the highest IRs for major bleeding/ICH. Major bleeding and ICH rates progressively increased with the HAS-BLED score, which showed generally good predictivity with C indexes > 0.70 for all cancer types. The CHA<sub>2</sub> DS<sub>2</sub> -VASc score's predictivity was slightly lower in AF patients with cancer.Cancer increased all-cause mortality, major bleeding, and ICH risk in AF patients. The association between cancer and ischemic stroke differed among cancer types, and in some types, the risk of bleeding seemed to exceed the thromboembolic risk."

    "title": "Epidemiologic outlook of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms and selection of high-risk patients: A Korean nationwide study.",
    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Although a considerable proportion of patients with cancer receive chemotherapy (CT) or radiotherapy (RT), only a very few patients eventually develop therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MNs).To identify subsets of cancer patients who have substantially elevated risk of developing t-MNs. Incidences and risks of t-MNs after contemporary CT or RT in patients newly diagnosed major cancers during 2009-2013 were analyzed. By merging two Korean nationwide health care big data sets, patients were selected and observed on follow-up to until t-MN development or December 2019.Among 250,155 patients, 555 (0.22%) were diagnosed with t-MNs with a standard incidence ratio (SIR) of 3.40 (95% CI, 3.13-3.70). Patients had bone/joint cancers (SIR, 94.25; 95% CI, 50.71-137.80) and a remarkably high SIR for t-MN development. Patients receiving both CT and RT had the highest SIR (4.64; 95% CI, 4.08-5.20), followed by those receiving CT only (SIR, 3.30; 95% CI, 2.89-3.70). Contrarily, RT alone did not increase t-MN risk (SIR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.76-1.56). More exposure to leukemogenic agents resulted in the higher t-MNs development.The increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome after CT and/or RT was confirmed and subsets with substantially elevated risk for developing t-MNs were found. Such patients would be suitable for a prospective cohort for investigating t-MN pathogenesis by time series analyses."

    "title": "Understanding the characteristics of US cancer survivors with informal caregivers.",
    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Although informal caregivers such as family and friends provide people with cancer needed physical care and emotional support, little is known about which individuals have access to such caregivers. The purpose of this article is to provide a nationally representative description of the sociodemographic characteristics of cancer survivors who have or had an informal caregiver in the United States.Cross-sectional data were taken from the Experiences With Cancer Survivorship Supplement of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey in 2011, 2016, and 2017. People were cancer survivors from diagnosis until the end of life. The study population consisted of adult survivors of cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer who were treated for cancer less than 3 years before the survey and were living in the community (n = 720). The main outcome measure was whether or not the cancer survivor reported having an informal caregiver.In the United States, 55.2% of cancer survivors reported having an informal caregiver during or after their cancer treatment. The relationship of the caregiver to the survivor varied by sex: males were more likely to have a spouse as their caregiver, and females were more likely to have a child as their caregiver. In multivariate analyses, cancer survivors who were female, were married, were of a race/ethnicity other than White, or were in poor health were more likely to have an informal caregiver.Future research can examine whether those without informal caregivers might need more formal support as they undergo cancer treatment and transition into cancer survivorship."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Cancer-related worry (CRW) is common among cancer survivors; however, little is known about factors associated with CRW or its impact on health behaviors in adult survivors of childhood cancer.Survivors in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study (n = 3211; 51% male; mean age, 31.2 years [SD, 8.4 years]; mean time after diagnosis, 22.8 years [SD, 8.3 years]) underwent medical evaluations and completed ratings of CRW, psychological symptoms, and health behaviors. Multivariable modified Poisson regression models examined associations between CRW and treatment exposures, chronic health conditions, psychological symptoms, and health behaviors.Sixty-four percent of survivors (95% confidence interval [CI], 62.6-65.9) reported worry about subsequent malignancy, 45% (95% CI, 43.5-46.9) reported worry about physical problems related to cancer, and 33% (95% CI, 31.2-34.4) reported worry about relapse. Multiple psychological symptoms, treatment exposures, and chronic conditions significantly increased the risk of CRW. Survivors reporting CRW were at increased risk for substance use, inadequate physical activity, and increased health care utilization after adjustments for chronic conditions. For example, with adjustments for chronic conditions, those who endorsed CRW were more likely to have \u22655 cancer-related physician visits, \u22655 physician visits related to cancer, and \u22655 calls to a physician's office in the previous 2 years in comparison with survivors who were not worried. CRW was also associated with an increased risk of current tobacco use, past marijuana use, and current marijuana use.A substantial proportion of adult survivors of childhood cancer reported CRW associated with increased health care utilization. CRW may serve as an intervention target to promote well-being and adaptive health behaviors."

    "title": "The Survivorship Sleep Program (SSP): A synchronous, virtual cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia pilot program among cancer survivors.",
    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "For cancer survivors, insomnia is prevalent, distressing, and persists for years if unmanaged. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is an effective treatment yet can be difficult to access and may require modification to address survivorship-specific barriers to sleep. In this 2-phase study, the authors adapted and assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of synchronous, virtual CBT-I adapted for cancer survivors (the Survivorship Sleep Program [SSP]).From April to August 2020, cancer survivors with insomnia (N\u00a0=\u00a010) were interviewed to refine SSP content and delivery. From October 2020 to March 2021, 40 survivors were recruited for a randomized controlled trial comparing 4 weekly SSP sessions with enhanced usual care (EUC) (CBT-I referral plus a sleep hygiene handout). Feasibility and acceptability were assessed by enrollment, retention, attendance, fidelity, survey ratings, and exit interviews. Insomnia severity (secondary outcome), sleep quality, sleep diaries, and fatigue were assessed at baseline, postintervention, and at 1-month follow-up using linear mixed models.The SSP included targeted content and clinician-led, virtual delivery to enhance patient centeredness and access. Benchmarks were met for enrollment (56% enrolled/eligible), retention (SSP, 90%; EUC, 95%), attendance (100%), and fidelity (95%). Compared with EUC, the SSP resulted in large, clinically significant improvements in insomnia severity (Cohen d\u00a0=\u00a01.19) that were sustained at 1-month follow-up (Cohen d\u00a0=\u00a01.27). Improvements were observed for all other sleep metrics except sleep diary total sleep time and fatigue.Synchronous, virtually delivered CBT-I targeted to cancer survivors is feasible, acceptable, and seems to be efficacious for reducing insomnia severity. Further testing in larger and more diverse samples is warranted."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Patients with chronic conditions are treated by many providers, which can increase the risk of communication gaps across providers and potential harm to patients. However, to the authors' knowledge, the extent of fragmented care among this population is unknown. In the current study, the authors sought to determine whether cancer survivors have more fragmented care than noncancer controls and to quantify the extent of fragmentation.Data from the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study linked to Medicare claims were used. The authors included beneficiaries with continuous Part A and B coverage for 12\u00a0months at the time of their baseline REGARDS survey. The primary outcome of the current study was claims-based fragmentation over 12\u00a0months, which was calculated using the reversed Bice-Boxerman Index so a higher score reflected greater fragmentation. Unadjusted differences in fragmentation were compared between cancer survivors and controls. Beta regression models were used to estimate associations between cancer status and fragmentation, adjusting for potential confounders.The authors included 4922 participants aged \u226565\u00a0years at baseline. Of these patients, approximately 21% were cancer survivors. Survivors had a median of 11 visits (interquartile range, 7-15 visits) with 5 providers compared with controls, who had a median of 9 visits (interquartile range, 6-14 visits) with 4 providers (P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). Cancer survivors had significantly more fragmented care compared with controls (median reversed Bice-Boxerman Index, 0.80 vs 0.76; P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). After adjusting for confounders, cancer survivors had an increased odds of having fragmented care (odds ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02-1.14).Care fragmentation is more prevalent among cancer survivors compared with those without a history of cancer. Future studies should examine whether fragmentation puts survivors at risk of worse outcomes."

There were 89 cases of bilateral TC (59.3 %), of these 8 cases were synchronous (diagnosed within three\u00a0months period from the primary diagnosis) and 81 metachronous (9 % and 91 % respectively). Non-testicular other primary malignancies (OPM) occurred in 61 cases (40.7 %), of which 59 cases were metachronous (96.7 %) and two cases were synchronous (3.3 %). Metachronous malignancies included mainly prostate cancer (n = 17 patients), kidney cancer (n = 13 patients) and colorectal cancer (n = 12 patients). Synchronous OPM was found in two patients.In our study we registered two cases of synchronous OPM, both histologically clear cell renal cancer. We have analyzed clinical characteristics, diagnosis and treatment strategies of synchronous OPM, in order to improve its diagnosis and therapy (Fig. 3, Ref. 22)."

Survivors of childhood cancer are at increased risk of long-term complications of therapeutic exposure. Second malignant neoplasms are one of the most severe side effects of cancer treatment. The frequency and type of secondary cancers may vary depending on the initial diagnosis, treatment administered and genetic predisposition. This review highlights the risk factors in the development of SMNs in survivors of pediatric cancers and their differences according to primary cancer type, genetic predisposition and treatment admistered. Finally, the review emphasizes the need for life-time follow-up of survivors of childhood cancer for the development of second malignancies."

    "content": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had profound effects on population health to date. African American cancer survivors are particularly vulnerable to developing severe consequences; therefore, understanding the impact of the virus on this patient population is critical.The Detroit Research on Cancer Survivors cohort is a unique effort to understand the determinants of poor outcomes in African American cancer survivors. To date, more than 4500 cancer survivors and nearly 950 primary caregivers have been enrolled; participation includes a survey and the collection of biospecimens, medical records, and tumor tissue. Beginning in the spring of 2020, a supplemental survey focusing on the impact of COVID-19 was offered to enrolled participants. The analysis included 890 survivors.Nearly all survivors (>99%) reported changes in their daily activities in an effort to reduce the risk of infection. More than 40% of the survivors reported some disruption in their access to medical care. A substantial proportion of the survivors (>40%) reported feeling anxious, depressed, and/or isolated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately 40% of the patients reported changes in health behaviors shown to negatively affect survivorship outcomes (physical inactivity, smoking, and alcohol use) as a result of the pandemic.The influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on African American cancer survivors is substantial: it has affected both their physical and mental health. Coupled with changes in health behaviors, these factors will likely affect outcomes in this high-risk patient population, and this makes further study and interventions necessary to mitigate the long-term impact of the pandemic on cancer outcomes."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Unlike Medicare, the Veterans Health Administration (VA) health care system does not require veterans with cancer to make the \"terrible choice\" between receipt of hospice services or disease-modifying chemotherapy/radiation therapy. For this report, the authors characterized the VA's provision of concurrent care, defined as days in the last 6 months of life during which veterans simultaneously received hospice services and chemotherapy or radiation therapy.This retrospective cohort study included veteran decedents with cancer during 2006 through 2012 who were identified from claims with cancer diagnoses. Hospice and cancer treatment were identified using VA and Medicare administrative data. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the changes in concurrent care, hospice, palliative care, and chemotherapy or radiation treatment.The proportion of veterans receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy remained stable at approximately 45%, whereas the proportion of veterans who received hospice increased from 55% to 68%. The receipt of concurrent care also increased during this time from 16.2% to 24.5%. The median time between hospice initiation and death remained stable at around 21 days. Among veterans who received chemotherapy or radiation therapy in their last 6 months of life, the median time between treatment termination and death ranged from 35 to 40 days. There was considerable variation between VA medical centers in the use of concurrent care (interquartile range, 16%-34% in 2012).Concurrent receipt of hospice and chemotherapy or radiation therapy increased among veterans dying from cancer without reductions in the receipt of cancer therapy. This approach reflects the expansion of hospice services in the VA with VA policy allowing the concurrent receipt of hospice and antineoplastic therapies.

    "content": "This study evaluates the independent association of Medicaid expansion on stage of presentation among patients of Black and White race with colorectal (CRC), breast, or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).A cohort study of patients with CRC, breast cancer, or NSCLC (2009-2017) in the National Cancer Database was performed. Difference-in-differences (DID) analysis was used to compare changes in tumor stage at diagnosis between Medicaid expansion (MES) and non-expansion states (non-MES) before and after expansion. Predictive margins were calculated by race, year, and insurance status to account for effect heterogeneity. Stage migration was determined by measuring the combined proportional increase in stage I and decrease in stage IV disease at diagnosis.Black patients gained less Medicaid coverage than White patients (6.0% vs 13.1%, p\u2009<\u20090.001) after expansion. Among Black and White patients, there was a shift towards increased early-stage diagnosis (DID 3.5% and 3.5%, respectively; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and decreased late-stage diagnosis (DID White: -3.5%; Black -2.5%; p\u2009<\u20090.001) in MES compared to non-MES following expansion. Overall stage migration was greater for White compared to Black patients with CRC (10.3% vs. 5.1%) and NSCLC (8.1% vs. 6.7%) after expansion. Stage migration effects in patients with breast cancer were similar by race (White 4.8% vs. Black 4.5%).An increased proportion of Black and White patients residing in Medicaid expansion states presented with earlier stage cancer following Medicaid expansion. However, because the proportion of Black patients is higher in non-expansion states, national racial disparities in cancer stage at presentation appear worse following Medicaid expansion."

    "content": "Shared decision-making (SDM) occurs when a patient partners with their oncologist to integrate personal preferences and values into treatment decisions. A key component of SDM is the elicitation of patient preferences and values, yet little is known about how and when these are elicited, communicated, prioritized, and documented within clinical encounters.This cross-sectional study evaluated nationwide data collected by CancerCare to better understand current patterns of SDM between patients and their oncology clinicians. Patient surveys included questions about the importance of quality-of-life preferences and discussions regarding quality-of-life priorities with their clinicians. Clinician surveys included questions about the discussion of quality-of-life priorities and preferences with patients, the effect of quality-of-life priorities on treatment recommendations, and quality-of-life priority documentation in practice.Patient survey completers (n\u00a0=\u00a0320; 33% response rate) were predominantly women (95%), had a diagnosis of breast cancer (59%), or were receiving active cancer treatment (59%). Clinician survey completers (n\u00a0=\u00a0112; 5% response rate) predominately identified as hematologists or oncologists (66%). Although 67% of clinicians reported knowing their patients' personal quality-of-life priorities and preferences before finalizing treatment plans, only 37% of patients reported that these discussions occurred before treatment initiation. Most patients (95%) considered out-of-pocket expenses important during treatment planning, yet only 59% reported discussing out-of-pocket expenses with their clinician before finalizing treatment plans. A majority of clinicians (52%) considered clinic questionnaires as feasible to document quality-of-life priorities and preferences.Patients and clinicians reported that preferences related to quality-of-life should be considered in treatment decision making, yet barriers to SDM, preference elicitation, and documentation remain."

    "content": "Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are precursor lesions of pancreatic cancer, which is characterized by an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Yet, the spatial distribution of the immune infiltrate and how it changes during IPMN progression is just beginning to be understood.We obtained tissue samples from patients who underwent pancreatic surgery for IPMN, and performed comprehensive immunohistochemical analyses to investigate the clinical significance, composition and spatial organization of the immune microenvironment during progression of IPMNs. Survival analysis of pancreatic cancer patients was stratified by tumour infiltrating immune cell subtypes.The immune microenvironment evolves from a diverse T cell mixture, comprising CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, Th/c1 and Th/c2 as major players combined with Th9, Th/c17, Th22, and Treg cells in low-grade IPMN, to a Treg dominated immunosuppressive state in invasive pancreatic cancer. Organized lymphoid clusters formed in IPMN surrounding stroma and accumulated immunosuppressive cell types during tumour progression. Survival of pancreatic cancer patients correlated with Th2 signatures in the tumour microenvironment.The major change with regards to T cell composition during IPMN progression occurs at the step of tissue invasion, indicating that malignant transformation only occurs when tumour immune surveillance is overcome. This suggests that novel immunotherapies that would boost spontaneous antitumor immunity at premalignant states could prevent pancreatic cancer development.The present work was supported by German Cancer Aid grants (70,112,720 and 70,113,167) to S.

    "content": "To the authors' knowledge, no previous study has examined the relationship between rural/urban residence and childhood or adolescent cancer survival in the United States. Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 18 registries database, the authors examined childhood and adolescent cancer survival by rural/urban residence as defined by Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCCs).The authors obtained data from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 18 registries for individuals diagnosed at ages birth to 19 years with a first primary malignant cancer from 2000 through 2010. Rural/urban residence at the time of diagnosis was defined using both metropolitan/nonmetropolitan county classifications and individual RUCC categories. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to compute adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the association between rural/urban residence and cancer survival. The authors also examined effect modification by age group, sex, race/ethnicity, and cancer type.Among 41,879 cancer cases, approximately 54.7% were non-Hispanic white, 54.3% were male, and 90.4% lived in a metropolitan county. Individuals living in nonmetropolitan counties versus metropolitan counties had a similar risk of cancer death (HR, \u202f1.03; 95% CI, 0.94-1.13) as did those living in nonmetropolitan rural counties with <2500 individuals nonadjacent to a metropolitan area versus those living in metropolitan counties of \u22651 million individuals (HR, \u202f0.98; 95% CI, 0.71-1.37). Evidence for effect modification largely was absent.The results of the current study suggest that childhood and adolescent cancer survival in the United States does not vary by rural/urban residence at the time of diagnosis as defined by RUCCs. The widespread availability of public health insurance for children and adolescents and a nationwide network of pediatric cancer providers may explain this finding."

The distant relapse-free survival (DRFS) between Black and White women with localized breast cancer who participated in National Cancer Institute-sponsored clinical trial was evaluated.Pooled data were analyzed from 8 National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) trials including 9702 women with localized breast cancer treated with adjuvant chemotherapy (AC, n = 7485) or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC, n = 2217), who self-reported as Black (n = 1070) or White (n = 8632) race. The association between race and DRFS was analyzed using log-rank tests and multivariate Cox regression.After adjustment for covariates including age, tumor size, nodal status, body mass index and taxane use, and treatment (AC vs NAC), Black race was associated with an inferior DRFS in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+; hazard ratio [HR], 1.24; 95% CI, 1.05-1.46; P = .01), but not in ER- disease (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.83-1.14; P = .73), and significant interaction between race and ER status was observed (P = .03). There was no racial disparity in DRFS among patients with pathologic complete response (pCR) (log-rank P = .8). For patients without pCR, Black race was associated with worse DRFS in ER+ (HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.14-2.45; P = .01), but not in ER- disease (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.65-1.28; P = .59).Black race was associated with significantly inferior DRFS in ER+ localized breast cancer treated with AC or NAC, but not in ER- disease. In the NAC group, racial disparity was also observed in patients with residual ER+ breast cancer at surgery, but not in those who had pCR.Black women with breast cancer have worse outcomes compared with White women. We investigated if this held true in the context of clinical trials that provide controlled treatment setting. Black women with cancer expressing estrogen receptors (ERs) had worse outcome than White women. If breast cancers did not express ERs, there was no racial disparity in outcome. We also observed racial disparity in women who received chemotherapy before their cancer was removed, but only if they had cancer expressing ERs and residual disease on completion of treatment. If the cancer disappeared with presurgical chemotherapy, there was no racial disparity."

The authors developed the Compassionate High-Alert Team (CHAT) intervention to manage patients receiving opioids for cancer pain who demonstrate NMOU behavior. The objective of this study was to determine the change in frequency of NMOU behaviors, pain intensity, and opioid requirements among those who received the intervention.A total of 130 patients receiving opioids for cancer pain that had documented evidence of NMOU and received the CHAT intervention were reviewed. Demographic and clinical information such as NMOU behaviors, pain scores, and morphine equivalent daily dose at baseline, 3, and 6\u2009months post-intervention was obtained.NMOU behaviors significantly decreased from a median (interquartile range) of 2 (1-3) at baseline to 0 (0-1) at both 3 and 6\u2009months post-intervention (p\u2009<\u2009.001). A total of 45 of 75 (60%) and 31 of 50 (62%) of CHAT recipients achieved complete response to the intervention at 3 and 6\u2009months, respectively. Higher baseline number of NMOU behaviors was independently associated with patient response to the intervention (odds ratio [OR], 1.97; 95% confidence interval [CI],1.09-4.28, p\u00a0=\u00a0.049 at 3\u2009months; OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.20-6.47, p\u00a0=\u00a0.03 at 6\u2009months). The median pain score decreased from 7 at baseline to 6 at both 3 and 6\u2009months (p\u00a0=\u00a0.01). Morphine equivalent daily dose did not significantly change during that same period (143\u2009mg/day vs. 139\u2009mg/day, p\u00a0=\u00a0.13).Most patients who received the CHAT intervention improved in their NMOU behaviors and pain intensity scores 3 and 6\u2009months post-intervention. These preliminary findings support the efficacy of CHAT in managing patients receiving opioids for cancer pain who demonstrate NMOU behavior."

To the authors' knowledge, few studies to date have characterized symptom burden in hospitalized patients with potentially curable cancers. The objective of the current study was to compare symptom burden, palliative care consultation, and readmission rates in hospitalized patients by cancer type and treatment intent.The authors conducted a single-center study of hospitalized patients with cancer between 2014 and 2017. They assessed physical symptoms using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System and psychological distress using the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 and the Primary Care PTSD (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder) Screen. Multivariate linear regression models were used to assess symptom burden, logistic regression was used to assess palliative care use, and competing risk regression was used to compare 90-day readmission risk.A total of 1549 patients were enrolled and surveyed. The majority of patients reported moderate to severe fatigue, poor well-being, and drowsiness with no significant differences noted by cancer type and treatment intent. Compared with other groups, patients with incurable solid cancer reported higher physical symptoms (beta coefficient [B], 4.73; P\u00a0<\u00a0.01) and symptoms of depression (B, 0.44; P\u00a0<\u00a0.01) and anxiety (B, 0.39; P\u00a0<\u00a0.01), but no difference in posttraumatic stress disorder. Among patients in the top quartile symptom burden according to the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System, the palliative care service was consulted in 14.7%, 7.9%, 25.0%, and 49.6%, respectively, of patients with potentially curable hematologic, potentially curable solid, incurable hematologic, and incurable solid cancers (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Compared with patients with potentially curable solid cancer, patients in each group experienced a higher risk of readmission within 90\u00a0days.Hospitalized patients with cancer experience substantial physical and psychological symptoms. Palliative care rarely is consulted for highly symptomatic patients with potentially curable cancers. Supportive care interventions should target the needs of symptomatic patients regardless of treatment intent."

Of these, 52,462 individuals living in 24 communities with information on incident hematologic neoplasms available in the cancer registry, who did not have a history of cancer and provided valid information on frequency of green tea consumption, were followed through 2009. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the incidence of hematologic neoplasms according to green tea consumption were analyzed.The incidence of hematologic neoplasms during a median follow-up of 13.3\u00a0years was 323. Compared with the never-drinkers of green tea, the multivariate HRs and 95% CIs for total hematologic neoplasms in green tea drinkers of \u2264 2 cups/day, 3-4 cups/day, and \u2265 5 cups/day were 0.65 (0.42-1.00), 0.73 (0.47-1.13), and 0.63 (0.42-0.96), respectively. The association was more prominent for acute myeloid leukemias and follicular lymphomas.The present cohort study suggests a protective effect of green tea against hematologic neoplasms, especially acute myeloid leukemias."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Mutation analysis using next-generation sequencing highlights the features of tumors with somatic alterations. However, the mutation profile of double cancer remains unclear. Here, we analyzed tumors derived from the same patient using whole exome sequencing (WES) to investigate the coherence of somatic mutations in double cancer.First, the tumor mutational burden (TMB) was investigated using WES of 5521 tumor specimens from a Japanese pan-cancer cohort. The frequencies of mutation concordance were then compared in these cancers. Finally, we calculated the expected value of mutational concordance fitting a Poisson distribution to determine the relationship between double and metastatic cancers.In all, 44, 58, and 121 paired samples were diagnosed as double cancer, multifocal lesions (derived from identical tissues), and metastasis, respectively. Our analysis revealed that common somatic mutations were almost entirely absent in double cancer, whereas primary tumors and metastatic foci harbored several identical alterations. Concordance of the mutation profile in the same patient reflects the tumor origin and development, suggesting the potential for identifying double cancer based on common somatic mutations. Furthermore, according to a Poisson distribution, double cancer could be discriminated based on paired samples from the same patient. The probability of double cancer with more than 10 mutations was \u22641 part-per-billion (ppb, 10<sup>-\u20099</sup>). In multifocal lesions, 74% of tumor pairs accumulated \u226410 common mutations, implying a difference in tumor origin within identical tissues.These findings indicate that counting common somatic mutations can indicate the differences in origin between tumors derived from the same patient. Our mutation coherence analysis can thus provide beneficial information for diagnosing double cancer."

    "content": "Because of concerns about sexual minorities' poor cancer survivorship, this study compared cancer survivors' health outcomes in relation to multiple intersecting social positions, namely gender, sexual orientation, and race/ethnicity.This secondary data analysis used 2014-2019 Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance Survey data. The survey respondents consisted of 40,482 heterosexual and sexual minority men and 69,302 heterosexual and sexual minority women who identified as White, Black, or Hispanic. Logistic regression models compared White, Black, and Hispanic male and female cancer survivors' health status, depression, and health-related quality of life by sexual orientation. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics and access to care.Mental health findings showed consistency, with sexual minority male and female cancer survivors having 2 to 3 times greater odds of depression and/or poor mental health among White, Black, and Hispanic survivors. Among White women, sexual minorities reported greater odds of fair or poor health, poor physical health, and poor activity days, whereas White sexual minority men showed similar odds in comparison with their heterosexual counterparts. Among Black and Hispanic sexual minority men and women, differences in the odds of fair or poor health, poor physical health, and poor activity days in comparison with their heterosexual counterparts were mostly explained by sociodemographic and access-to-care factors.Physical and mental health outcomes vary in relation to sexual orientation and race/ethnicity among both female and male cancer survivors. Clinicians, researchers, and health care administrators must better understand and address the unique needs of cancer survivors in relation to multiple axes of social inequality to advance cancer equity."

Individually, SDOHs increase the risk of cancer mortality, but their cumulative burden is not well understood. The authors sought to determine the combined effect of SDOH on cancer mortality.Using the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort, the authors studied 29,766 participants aged 45+ years and followed them 10+ years. Eight potential SDOHs were considered, and retained SDOHs that were associated with cancer mortality (P < .10) were retained to create a count (0, 1, 2, 3+). Cox proportional hazard models estimated associations between the SDOH count and cancer mortality through December 31, 2017, adjusting for confounders. Models were age-stratified (45-64 vs 65+ years).Participants were followed for a median of 10.6 years (interquartile range [IQR], 6.5, 12.7 years). Low education, low income, zip code poverty, poor public health infrastructure, lack of health insurance, and social isolation were significantly associated with cancer mortality. In adjusted models, among those <65 years, compared to no SDOHs, having 1 SDOH (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.39; 95% CI, 1.11-1.75), 2 SDOHs (aHR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.26-2.07), and 3+ SDOHs (aHR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.58-2.75) were associated with cancer mortality (P for trend <.0001). Among individuals 65+ years, compared to no SDOH, having 1 SDOH (aHR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.00-1.35) and 3+ SDOHs (aHR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.04-1.52) was associated with cancer mortality (P for trend = .032).A greater number of SDOHs were significantly associated with an increased risk of cancer mortality, which persisted after adjustment for confounders."

    "content": "Given the immune system's importance for cancer surveillance and treatment, we have investigated how it may be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection of cancer patients. Across some heterogeneity in tumor type, stage, and treatment, virus-exposed solid cancer patients display a dominant impact of SARS-CoV-2, apparent from the resemblance of their immune signatures to those for COVID-19<sup>+</sup> non-cancer patients. This is not the case for hematological malignancies, with virus-exposed patients collectively displaying heterogeneous humoral responses, an exhausted T\u00a0cell phenotype and a high prevalence of prolonged virus shedding. Furthermore, while recovered solid cancer patients' immunophenotypes resemble those of non-virus-exposed cancer patients, recovered hematological cancer patients display distinct, lingering immunological legacies. Thus, while solid cancer patients, including those with advanced disease, seem no more at risk of SARS-CoV-2-associated immune dysregulation than the general population, hematological cancer patients show complex immunological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 exposure that might usefully inform their care."

    "content": "Approximately 40% of patients with cancer also have another chronic medical condition. Patient-centered medical homes (PCMHs) have improved outcomes among patients with multiple chronic comorbidities. The authors first evaluated the impact of a cancer diagnosis on chronic medication adherence among patients with Medicaid coverage and, second, whether PCMHs influenced outcomes among patients with cancer.Using linked 2004 to 2010 North Carolina cancer registry and claims data, the authors included Medicaid enrollees who were diagnosed with breast, colorectal, or lung cancer who had hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and/or diabetes mellitus. Using difference-in-difference methods, the authors examined adherence to chronic disease medications as measured by the change in the percentage of days covered over time among patients with and without cancer. The authors then further evaluated whether PCMH enrollment modified the observed differences between those patients with and without cancer using a differences-in-differences-in-differences approach. The authors examined changes in health care expenditures and use as secondary outcomes.Patients newly diagnosed with cancer who had hyperlipidemia experienced a 7-percentage point to 11-percentage point decrease in the percentage of days covered compared with patients without cancer. Patients with cancer also experienced significant increases in medical expenditures and hospitalizations compared with noncancer controls. Changes in medication adherence over time between patients with and without cancer were not determined to be statistically significantly different by PCMH status. Some PCMH patients with cancer experienced smaller increases in expenditures (diabetes) and emergency department use (hyperlipidemia) but larger increases in their inpatient hospitalization rates (hypertension) compared with non-PCMH patients with cancer relative to patients without cancer.PCMHs were not found to be associated with improvements in chronic disease medication adherence, but were associated with lower costs and emergency department visits among some low-income patients with cancer."

    "content": "Extant evidence links neighborhood walkability with obesity-related health in the general population. This association likely exists in cancer survivors, but research is limited. Furthermore, a disproportionate obesity burden in African American cancer survivors warrants subgroup-specific analyses.This study analyzed data from 2089 African American cancer survivors participating in the Detroit Research on Cancer Survivors (ROCS) cohort. On the basis of built environment data summarized within 1-km radial buffers around census block centroids, a multidimensional neighborhood walkability index (NWI) was constructed. Survivors' residential addresses at Detroit ROCS enrollment were geocoded, and addresses were linked to NWI scores via the census block of residence. At study enrollment, survivors reported height and weight; these data were used to calculate their body mass index (BMI). Associations between NWI quartiles and BMI overall and by cancer type, biological sex, and physical activity engagement were evaluated.BMI was found to be inversely associated with increasing NWI quartile (P for trend < .01). This inverse relationship was observed in men (P for trend < .01) and in survivors reporting any regular physical activity (P for trend < .01).This study's findings suggest that among African American cancer survivors, higher neighborhood walkability is associated with lower BMI. As health care systems in the United States increasingly consider the role of the neighborhood environment in their patients' health, these findings provide additional evidence supporting health systems' incorporation of neighborhood walkability as an obesity-related health indicator for this cancer survivor subgroup and potentially for cancer survivors from other vulnerable populations."

Self-reported health status is used as a predictor of health disparities.This secondary data analysis study used 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data to analyze cancer survivorship characteristics by sexual orientation and sex through the use of logistic regressions.Overall, 17,656,329 US cancer survivors were included in this study after weighting, with percentage estimates of 1.52% for gays/lesbians and 1.41% for bisexuals. LGB participants were younger and more ethnically diverse. Significantly, bisexuals had current smoking (32.3% vs 13.6%) and binge drinking rates (17.1% vs 9.1%) twice those of heterosexuals; 16.6% of bisexuals versus 4.1% of heterosexuals reported no health insurance coverage (P < .0001). After adjustments for socioeconomic, health-related behavioral risk, and health care access factors, bisexual females reported poorer general health (odds ratio [OR], 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.31-1.36) as well as mental health (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 2.39-2.46) than their heterosexual peers (P < .0001). Bisexual males were 5.14 times more likely to be told that they had depressive disorders than their heterosexual counterparts (95% CI, 5.05-5.23), whereas bisexual females were 3.23 times more likely for the same outcome (95% CI, 3.18-3.28). All LGB groups reported significantly more inadequate sleep than their heterosexual counterparts (especially lesbians: OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 2.10-2.18).This study indicates that LGB cancer survivors have worse survivorship than their heterosexual peers with heterogeneity in subgroups. Future studies should use larger sample sizes, further investigate disparities, and promote survivorship in LGB populations.It has been observed that lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) cancer survivors may face challenges in cancer survivorship that are not as prevalent in the heterosexual community. This cross-sectional study has found that LGB cancer survivors, especially bisexuals, have overall poorer physical and mental health, are more likely to be told that they have depressive disorders, and have worse sleep quality in comparison with their heterosexual counterparts. These results also differ by sex, and this can provide rationales for future studies and guide interventions to relocate resources to better promote equality."

Because Hispanics are disproportionally affected by the HIV epidemic and by infection-related cancers, this study compared incidence rates for HPV-related cancers and survival between Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites (NHWs) and non-Hispanic blacks (NHBs) in the HIV-infected US population.Based on data from the HIV/AIDS Cancer Match Study, standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were used to estimate cancer risk in HIV-infected Hispanics and the general US Hispanic population. Among HIV-infected people, cancer rates were compared with incidence rate ratios (IRRs), and survival was compared with hazard ratios between Hispanics and NHWs and NHBs.Five hundred two HPV-related cancers occurred in 864,067 person-years of follow-up among HIV-infected Hispanics. Except for oropharyngeal cancer, the risk of HPV-related cancers was higher among HIV-infected Hispanics than in the general population (SIR range, 3.59 [cervical cancer] to 18.7 [anal cancer in men]). Among HIV-infected females, Hispanics had higher cervical cancer rates than NHWs (IRR, 1.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19-2.43) but lower vulvar cancer rates than NHWs (IRR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.24-0.67) and NHBs (IRR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.41-0.95). Among HIV-infected males, Hispanics had higher penile cancer rates than NHWs (IRR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.36-4.96) but lower anal cancer rates than NHWs (IRR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.46-0.63) and NHBs (IRR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.56-0.77). Among HIV-infected Hispanics, 5-year survival was greater than 50% across HPV-related cancer types, with no major differences by racial/ethnic group.HIV-infected Hispanics have an elevated risk for HPV-related cancers. Similarly to the general population, HIV-infected Hispanics have higher rates of cervical and penile cancer than NHWs and NHBs. HPV vaccination should be promoted among HIV-infected individuals to reduce the burden of HPV-related cancers."

    "content": "Breast cancer survivors are at an increased risk of developing certain types of hematologic malignant neoplasm after diagnosis.To estimate the incidence of various types of hematologic malignant neoplasm in breast cancer survivors, both in absolute terms and in association with the general population.This nationwide cohort study conducted in France used data from the French National Health Data System, a database that contains all of French residents' health-related expenses. All French women aged 20 to 85 years with an incident breast cancer diagnosis between July 1, 2006, and December 31, 2015, were included (n\u2009=\u2009439 704) and followed up until hematologic malignant neoplasm occurrence, death, loss of follow-up, or December 31, 2016, whichever came first. Comparisons were made with all French women in the general population who were registered in the French general health insurance program each year from January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2016. Data analysis was performed from January 23, 2018, to May 25, 2018.Main outcomes were incident hematologic malignant neoplasm cases occurring at least 6 months after breast cancer diagnosis. The various types of hematologic malignant neoplasm considered were acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), multiple myeloma (MM), Hodgkin lymphoma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (HL/NHL), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphocytic lymphoma (ALL/LL). Incidence of these various types was estimated among breast cancer survivors and compared with the incidence in women in the general population.The 439\u202f704 women in the study had a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 59 (50-69) years and were followed up for a median (IQR) duration of 5 (2.8-7.5) years. Overall, 3046 cases of hematologic malignant neoplasm occurred: 509 cases (16.7%) of AML (crude incidence rate [CIR] per 100 000 person-years, 24.5; 95% CI, 22.4-26.8), 832 cases (27.3%) of MDS (CIR, 40.1; 95% CI, 37.4-42.9), and 267 cases (8.8%) of MPN (CIR, 12.8; 95% CI, 11.4-14.5). Lymphoid neoplasm cases included 420 cases (13.8%) of MM (CIR, 20.3; 95% CI, 18.4-22.3), 912 cases (29.9%) of HL/NHL (CIR, 44.4; 95% CI, 41.1-50.0), and 106 cases (3.5%) of ALL/LL (CIR, 5.1; 95% CI, 4.2-6.2). Compared with the general population, breast cancer survivors had statistically significantly higher incidence of AML (standardized incidence rate ratio [SIRR], 2.8; 95% CI, 2.5-3.2) and MDS (SIRR, 5.0; 95% CI, 4.4-5.7) and, to a lesser extent, MM (SIRR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3-1.7]) and ALL/LL (SIRR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3-3.0).The finding that AML and MDS still occur among breast cancer survivors today, and that ALL/LL and MM may also be of concern, merits the continuous monitoring of hematologic malignant neoplasms and the thorough investigations into their underlying mechanisms."

They used univariable and multivariable logistic regression models to analyze sociodemographic and clinical associations with phase 1 versus phase 2/3 trial enrollment.Among 3103 patients enrolled in cancer trials, 2657 unique patients participated in phase 1/2/3 trials. For patients enrolled in phase 1 (n = 1401) versus phase 2/3 (n = 1256) trials, we found no significant differences by age, insurance status, marital status, and income. Overall, 1216 (93%) White, 72 (6%) Asian, and 21 (2%) Black patients enrolled on phase 1 trials, whereas 1068 (93%) White, 40 (3%) Asian, and 43 (4%) Black patients enrolled on phase 2/3 trials. Adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, insurance status, marital status, income, cancer type, disease status, travel distance, and trial year, compared with White patients, Black patients had lower phase 1 enrollment (odds ratio [OR], 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25-0.82), as did Hispanic/Latino (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.08-0.79) and male patients (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62-0.94). Asian patients had higher phase 1 enrollment (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.88-2.16).Disparities in phase 1 versus phase 2/3 cancer clinical trial enrollment underscore the urgent need for interventions addressing inequities in early-phase trial participation.Phase 1 trials are of increasing importance in oncology. The authors of the study analyzed all patients enrolling on cancer clinical trials at a large academic cancer center from October 2011 to November 2014. Among the 2657 trial participants, when age, sex, race, ethnicity, insurance status, marital status, income, cancer type, disease status, travel distance, and trial year were taken into account, Black, Hispanic/Latino, and male patients were less likely to enroll on phase 1 trials versus phase 2/3 trials. These findings suggest a need for targeted interventions to improve access to and education about phase 1 trials for Black and Hispanic/Latino patients."

    "content": "Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, and researchers seek to identify modifiable risk factors Over the past several decades, there has been ongoing debate whether opioids are associated with cancer development, metastasis, or recurrence. Basic science, clinical, and observational studies have produced conflicting results. The authors examined the association between prescription opioids and incident cancers using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. A complex relation was observed between prescription opioids and incident cancer, and cancer site may be an important determinant.By using linked SEER cancer registry and Medicare claims from 2008 through 2013, a case-control study was conducted examining the relation between cancer onset and prior opioid exposure. Logistic regression was used to account for differences between cases and controls for 10 cancer sites.Of the population studied (n = 348,319), 34% were prescribed opioids, 79.5% were white, 36.9% were dually eligible (for both Medicare and Medicaid), 13% lived in a rural area, 52.7% had \u22651 comorbidity, and 16% had a smoking-related diagnosis. Patients exposed to opioids had a lower odds ratio (OR) associated with breast cancer (adjusted OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.92-0.99) and colon cancer (adjusted OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.86-0.93) compared with controls. Higher ORs for kidney cancer, leukemia, liver cancer, lung cancer, and lymphoma, ranging from lung cancer (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07) to liver cancer (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.08-1.31), were present in the exposed population.The current results suggest that an association exists between prescription opioids and incident cancer and that cancer site may play an important role. These findings can direct future research on specific patient populations that may benefit or be harmed by prescription opioid exposure."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Although there are a growing number of survivors of adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer, to the authors' knowledge the long-term overall survival (OS) patterns for AYA cancer survivors are underreported. The objective of the current study was to assess the long-term survival of AYA cancer survivors and identify factors associated with diminished long-term survival.The authors used The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center's tumor registry to identify 5-year survivors of cancer diagnosed as AYAs (ages 15-39\u00a0years) between the years 1970 and 2005, and who were alive 5\u00a0years after diagnosis. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate OS rates over time, and Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to evaluate the association of covariates with OS.The authors identified 16,728 individuals who were 5-year survivors of cancer and were diagnosed as AYAs with a median follow-up of 20.0\u00a0years. The 10-year, 20-year, and 25-year OS rates were 86% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 85%-86%), 74% (95% CI, 73%-75%), and 68% (95% CI, 67%-68%), respectively, all of which were lower than the age-adjusted estimated survival rates of the general population. Long-term OS improved for AYAs diagnosed between 2000 and 2005 compared with those diagnosed in the prior decades (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Older age at the time of diagnosis, receipt of radiation, and diagnoses including central nervous system tumors and breast cancer each were associated with diminished long-term survival.AYA cancer survivors have inferior long-term survival compared with the general population. Studies investigating the prevalence and types of late treatment effects and causes of death among AYA survivors are needed to more accurately identify AYAs who are at highest risk of early or late mortality."

The authors compared MH outcomes between respondents with a cancer history and respondents without a cancer history in adjusted analyses controlling for demographics and socioeconomic status. Outcomes included past-year major depressive episodes, serious psychological distress, suicidal thoughts, suicidal plans, suicidal attempts, any mental illness, and serious mental illness. All analyses were stratified by age group (18-34, 35-49, or 50-64\u00a0years).In a comparison of 2656 survivors and 112,952 individuals without cancer, within each age group, survivors had an elevated prevalence of MH problems in 5 of the 7 outcome measures. Among young adults (aged 18-34\u00a0years), survivors were more likely than noncancer counterparts to experience major depressive episodes (18.1% vs 9.6%), serious psychological distress (34.2% vs 17.9%), suicidal thoughts (10.5% vs 7.0%), any mental illness (41.1% vs 23.3%), and serious mental illness (13.2% vs 5.9%) in the past year (P values <.05). These differences persisted in adjusted analyses (P values <.01). Similar survivor-comparison differences were observed among older groups but with a smaller magnitude. Among survivors, young adult survivors had the highest likelihood of experiencing MH problems across all outcomes (P values <.05).This population-based study shows an elevated prevalence of MH problems among adult cancer survivors in comparison with the general population. This finding highlights the importance of developing strategies to ensure the early detection of mental illness and to improve access to MH treatment for cancer survivors."

    "title": "Circulating Small Extracellular Vesicles Activate TYRO3 to Drive Cancer Metastasis and Chemoresistance.",
    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Extracellular vesicles (EV) in the tumor microenvironment have emerged as crucial mediators that promote proliferation, metastasis, and chemoresistance. However, the role of circulating small EVs (csEV) in cancer progression remains poorly understood. In this study, we report that csEV facilitate cancer progression and determine its molecular mechanism. csEVs strongly promoted the migration of cancer cells via interaction with phosphatidylserine of csEVs. Among the three TAM receptors, TYRO3, AXL, and MerTK, TYRO3 mainly interacted with csEVs. csEV-mediated TYRO3 activation promoted migration and metastasis via the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and stimulation of RhoA in invasive cancer cells. Additionally, csEV-TYRO3 interaction induced YAP activation, which led to increased cell proliferation and chemoresistance. Combination treatment with gefitinib and KRCT-6j, a selective TYRO3 inhibitor, significantly reduced tumor volume in xenografts implanted with gefitinib-resistant non-small cell lung cancer cells. The results of this study show that TYRO3 activation by csEVs facilitates cancer cell migration and chemoresistance by activation of RhoA or YAP, indicating that the csEV/TYRO3 interaction may serve as a potential therapeutic target for aggressive cancers in the clinic. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate that circulating extracellular vesicles are a novel driver in migration and survival of aggressive cancer cells via TYRO3 activation.

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Targeted therapy has become increasingly important and indispensable in cancer therapy. Cullin3-RING ligases (CRL3) serve as essential executors for regulating protein homeostasis in cancer development, highlighting that CRL3 might be promising targets in various cancer treatment. However, how to design new targeted therapies by disrupting the function of CRL3 is poorly understood. Here, we focus on the substrate adaptors of CRL3, and carry out a systematical research on the function of Kelch-like (KLHL) family proteins. We have identified twenty-four KLHL proteins with function of tumor promotion and thirteen KLHL proteins with high clinical significance on cancer therapy. Furthermore, we have clarified the novel biological function of KLHL13 as a vital factor that contributes to malignant progression in lung cancer. Taken together, our findings reveal multiple potential therapeutical targets and provide evidence for targeting CRL3 via KLHL substrate adaptors for cancer therapy."

    "title": "Is cancer prevention influenced by the built environment? A multidisciplinary scoping review.",
    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "The built environment is a significant determinant of human health. Globally, the growing prevalence of preventable cancers suggests a need to understand how features of the built environment shape exposure to cancer development and distribution within a population. This scoping review examines how researchers across disparate fields understand and discuss the built environment in primary and secondary cancer prevention. It is focused exclusively on peer-reviewed sources published from research conducted in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States from 1990 to 2017. The review captured 9958 potential results in the academic literature, and this body of results was scoped to 268 relevant peer-reviewed journal articles indexed across 13 subject databases. Spatial proximity, transportation, land use, and housing are well-understood features of the built environment that shape cancer risk. Built-environment features predominantly influence air quality, substance use, diet, physical activity, and screening adherence, with impacts on breast cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and overall cancer risk. The majority of the evidence fails to provide direct recommendations for advancing cancer prevention policy and program objectives for municipalities. The expansion of interdisciplinary work in this area would serve to create a significant population health impact."

    "category": "cancer",
    "content": "Childhood cancer survivors have been reported to be vulnerable to psychiatric morbidities and risky health behavior. Suicides, substance abuse, accidents, and violence as causes of death can be regarded as an extreme manifestation of risky health behavior. In the current study, the authors studied the risk of suicide and other risky health behavior-related deaths among childhood cancer patients in Denmark, Finland, and Sweden.Using linkage between national cancer, population, and cause-of-death registries, the authors investigated the causes of death in 29,285 patients diagnosed with cancer before age 20\u00a0years between 1971 and 2009 compared with a cohort of 146,282 age-matched, sex-matched, and country-matched population comparisons. Rate ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs were estimated using Poisson regression models, adjusting for demographic factors.The overall risk of dying of a risky health behavior was found to be increased among childhood cancer patients (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.06-1.47) when compared with population comparisons. The elevated risk was statistically significant among patients with central nervous system tumors (RR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.08-2.05) and patients diagnosed at ages 5 to 9\u00a0years and 15 to 19\u00a0years (RR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.01-2.24] and RR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.03-1.67], respectively). The overall risk of suicide was found to be increased (RR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.02-1.83), and statistically significantly so when patients were diagnosed between ages 15 and 19\u00a0years (RR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.09-2.39).Childhood cancer patients appear to have an increased risk of risky health behavior-related causes of death compared with the general population. The results of the current study suggest the importance of integrating psychosocial support into the follow-up care of these individuals."

Before initiation, patients and their entourage receive information on renal disease and treatment options. The purpose of this study is to assess the level of knowledge as well as the opinion of patients on haemodialysis and of their entourage on chronic kidney disease and substitution therapies. We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study in the Department of Haemodialysis at the Sylvanus Olympio University Hospital (CHU-SO) from 29 July to 19 August 2020. The study population was composed by all the haemodialysis patients in the Department of Haemodialysis at the CHU-SO and by their accompanying persons who gave their free and informed consent. Anonymous survey was used to collect data. Data collection and statistical analysis were carried out using the Epi Info software 7.2.2.6. Eighty-one patients and 79 accompanying persons were interviewed. The average ages of patients and their accompanying persons were 49.7 years \u00b1 13.5 and 39,6years \u00b1 13.2 respectively. All patients knew their disease and 94% of accompanying persons were informed about their parents' disease. Hemodialysis was considered very expensive by 95.1% of patients. Patients stated that improved quality of life was the most known benefit of hemodialysis (80.2%) while 15% also thought that renal transplantation was equally effective. The majority of accompanying persons (85%) stated that hemodialysis was the best treatment. Haemodialysis education program for patients and their accompanying persons is essential to better overall management of haemodialysis patients."

    "title": "Using patient feedback to adapt intervention materials based on acceptance and commitment therapy for people receiving renal dialysis.",
    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Theory-based intervention materials must be carefully adapted to meet the needs of users with specific physical conditions. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has been adapted successfully for cancer, chronic pain, diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome, multiple sclerosis, and a range of other conditions, but not so far for people receiving renal haemodialysis. This paper presents findings from a study to adapt ACT-based intervention materials specifically for renal dialysis.Draft written materials consisting of four stories depicting fictitious individuals who used ACT-related techniques to help overcome different challenges and difficulties related to dialysis were adapted using a systematic patient consultation process. The participants were 18 people aged 19-80\u00a0years, with chronic kidney disease and receiving renal dialysis. Individual, semi-structured interviews were conducted to elicit participants' views about how the content of the draft materials should be adapted to make them more realistic and relevant for people receiving renal dialysis and about how the materials should be presented and delivered to people receiving renal dialysis. The interview transcripts were analysed using a qualitative adaptation of the Delphi method in which themes are used as a framework for translating feedback into proposals for modifications.The analysis of patient feedback supported the use of patient stories but suggested they should be presented by video and narrated by real dialysis patients. They also indicated specific adaptations to make the stories more credible and realistic. Participant feedback was translated into proposals for change that were considered along with clinical, ethical and theoretical factors. The outcome was a design for a video-based intervention that separated the stories about individuals from the explanations of the specific ACT techniques and provided greater structure, with material organised into smaller chunks. This intervention is adapted specifically for people receiving renal dialysis while retaining the distinctive theoretical principles of ACT.The study shows the value of consulting patients in the development of intervention materials and illustrates a process for integrating patient feedback with theoretical, clinical and practical considerations in intervention design."

Empirical data on healthcare resource use, patients' out-of-pocket costs, time spent on transportation and dialysis by ESRD patients and time spent by caregivers were analysed. All costs were expressed in Hong Kong year 2017 dollars.Analysis was based on 402 ESRD patients on maintenance dialysis (PD: 189; hospital-based HD: 170; and nocturnal home HD: 43). From the perspective of the healthcare provider, hospital-based HD had the highest total annual direct medical costs in the initial year (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD) (hospital-based HD = $400\u2009057 \u00b1 62\u2009822; PD = $118\u2009467 \u00b1 15\u2009559; nocturnal home HD = $223\u2009358 \u00b1 18\u2009055; P\u2009<\u20090.001) and second year (hospital-based HD = $360\u2009924\u2009 \u00b1 63\u2009014; PD = $80\u2009796 \u00b1 15\u2009820; nocturnal home HD = $87\u2009028 \u00b1 9059; P\u2009<\u20090.001).

From both perspectives, PD is cost-saving relative to hospital-based HD and nocturnal home HD, except that nocturnal home HD has the lowest cost in the second year of treatment from the societal perspective. Results from this cost analysis facilitate economic evaluation in Hong Kong for health services and management targeted at ESRD patients."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Many studies have explored patients' experiences of dialysis and other treatments for kidney failure. This is the first qualitative multi-site international study of how staff perceive the process of a patient's transition from peritoneal dialysis to in-centre haemodialysis. Current literature suggests that transitions are poorly coordinated and may result in increased patient morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to understand staff perspectives of transition and to identify areas where clinical practice could be improved.Sixty-one participants (24 UK and 37 Australia), representing a cross-section of kidney care staff, took part in seven focus groups and sixteen interviews. Data were analysed inductively and findings were synthesised across the two countries.For staff, good clinical practice included: effective communication with patients, well planned care pathways and continuity of care. However, staff felt that how they communicated with patients about the treatment journey could be improved. Staff worried they inadvertently made patients fear haemodialysis when trying to explain to them why going onto peritoneal dialysis first is a good option. Despite staff efforts to make transitions smooth, good continuity of care between modalities was only reported in some of the Australian hospitals where, unlike the UK, patients kept the same consultant. Timely access to an appropriate service, such as a psychologist or social worker, was not always available when staff felt it would be beneficial for the patient. Staff were aware of a disparity in access to kidney care and other healthcare professional services between some patient groups, especially those living in remote areas. This was often put down to the lack of funding and capacity within each hospital.This research found that continuity of care between modalities was valued by staff but did not always happen. It also highlighted a number of areas for consideration when developing ways to improve care and provide appropriate support to patients as they transition from peritoneal dialysis to in-centre haemodialysis."

    "content": "Hypomagnesaemia in haemodialysis (HD) is associated with increased mortality risk: its relationship with dialysis fluid (DF).Low concentrations of magnesium (Mg) in blood have been linked to the development of diabetes, hypertension, arrhythmias, vascular calcifications and an increased risk of death in the general population and in haemodialysis patients. The composition of the dialysis fluid in terms of its magnesium concentration is one of the main determinants of magnesium in haemodialysis patients.To study magnesium concentrations in haemodialysis patients, their predictive mortality rate and what factors are associated with hypomagnesaemia and mortality in haemodialysis.Retrospective study of a cohort of prevalent haemodialysis patients followed up for two years. Serum magnesium was measured every six months. The analysis used the initial and average magnesium values for each patient, comparing patients with magnesium below the mean (2.1mg/dl) with those with magnesium above the mean. During the follow-up, three types of dialysis fluid were used: type 1, magnesium 0.5 mmol/l; type 3, magnesium 0.37 mmol/l (both with acetate); and type 2, magnesium 0.5 mmol/l with citrate.We included 137 haemodialysis patients in the study, of which 72 were male and 65 were female, with a mean age of 67 (15) [26-95] years old. Of this group, 57 patients were diabetic, 70 were on online haemodiafiltration (OL-HDF) and 67 were on high-flow haemodialysis (HF-HD). The mean magnesium of the 93 patients with dialysis fluid type 1 was 2.18 (0.37) mg/dl. In the 27 patients with dialysis fluid type 3 it was 2.02 (0.42) mg/dl. And in the 17 with dialysis fluid type 2 it was 1.84 (0.24) mg/dl (p=.01). There was a pronounced direct relationship between Mg and P and albumin. After a mean follow-up of 16.6 (8.9) [3-24] months, 77 remained active, 24 had died and 36 had been transplanted or transferred. Patients with magnesium above than 2.1mg/dl had a longer survival (p=.008). The survival of patients with the three types of dialysis fluid did not differ significantly (Log-Rank, p=.424). Corrected for blood magnesium, patients with dialysis fluid with citrate have better survival (p=.009). The COX regression analysis shows how age, serum albumin, magnesium, dialysis technique and type of dialysis fluid have an independent predictive mortality rate.Low serum magnesium levels have a greater association with an increased risk of mortality compared to high levels. The type of dialysis fluid affects the magnesium concentration and the risk of death."

The baseline clinical data, serum indices, as well as environmental factors such as education level, marital status, work, residential pattern, household income, and expenditure were recorded. The quality of life was assessed using the short-form 36-item (SF-36) scale reflecting the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS). One-way analysis of variance and logistic stepwise multiple regression analysis were performed to analyze the factors influencing the quality of life.The renal transplantation group had the highest average scores for all dimensions of the SF-36 scale. The PCS and MCS scores of this group were higher than those of the hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis groups. The peritoneal dialysis group had higher scores for physical functioning, physical role, bodily pain, general health, mental health, PCS, and MCS than those of the hemodialysis group. Age, HGB, GLU, and ALP were the main factors influencing PCS. Age, education level, residential pattern, medication expenditure, and monthly per capita income mainly affected MCS.In terms of quality of life, renal transplantation is superior to peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis."

    "content": "BACKGROUND This study compared the effects of peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis on cognitive dysfunction and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients and analyzed other potential influencing factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 265 patients who received dialysis at our hospital were included and divided into the hemodialysis group (n=115) and the peritoneal dialysis group (n=150). The cognitive performance was assessed by the Beijing version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. The Kidney Disease Quality of 36-Item Short Form Survey and a kidney disease-related quality of life assessment were used for evaluating HRQOL. Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were used to explore the effects of dialysis on cognitive dysfunction and HRQOL. RESULTS As compared with the hemodialysis group, the peritoneal dialysis group had lower scores on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (\u00df=-8.35, 95% CI: -9.85 to -6.86), 36-Item Short Form Survey (\u00df=-10.20, 95% CI: -11.94 to -8.45), and kidney disease-related quality of life assessment (\u00df=-8.67, 95% CI: -10.10 to -7.23). After adjustment for sex, age, BMI, marital status, educational level, income level, presence of diabetes, duration of kidney disease, duration of dialysis, and dialysis frequency, the results were consistent with that of the crude model. CONCLUSIONS In the present study, patients receiving peritoneal dialysis had worse cognitive dysfunction and worse HRQOL compared to patients receiving hemodialysis, which might lead to poorer outcomes of ESRD patients. The related factors affecting cognitive dysfunction and HRQOL were also explored, which could help clinicians to determine the optimal treatment for ESRD patients."

    "content": "Patients on renal dialysis often develop severe acne. In spite of this, the literature remains scarce about the use of isotretinoin for the treatment of acne in this group of patients, and many clinicians remain apprehensive and hesitant to use it.To systematically review the literature surrounding the safety and efficacy of isotretinoin for the treatment of acne in patients on renal dialysis.Four electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Emcare) were systematically searched in March 2021. The search strategy incorporated the terms 'isotretinoin', 'renal', 'kidney', 'dialysis' and 'acne', along with terms closely related to these. Studies were considered eligible if they reported the use of isotretinoin for treatment of acne in patients with renal impairment or on renal dialysis, and if they had relevant implications to this topic.The search resulted in a total of 63 results. Using the PRISMA approach, 11 articles were deemed relevant to this review: 1 randomized single-blinded placebo-controlled trial, 2 case series, 2 retrospective studies and 6 case reports. Hence the level of evidence was mostly low (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations level 3).This review of the literature suggests that low-dose isotretinoin (10-20\u2009mg) can safely and successfully be used to treat severe acne in patients on renal dialysis, leading to a significant improvement in their quality of life. As the current literature on this topic is scarce, more studies would be beneficial to further establish the safe use of isotretinoin in patients on renal dialysis."

    "content": "Cryptococcosis is a lethal fungal infection mainly caused by Cryptococcus neoformans/C. gattii species. Currently, our understanding of cryptococcosis episodes in HIV-negative patients during renal dialysis remains scarce and fragmented. Here, we performed an analysis of pooled cases to systemically summarize the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of cryptococcosis among HIV-negative patients with renal dialysis. Using pooled data from our hospital and studies identified in four medical databases, 18 cases were identified and analyzed. The median duration time of renal dialysis for peritoneal renal dialysis and hemodialysis cases was 8\u00a0months and 36\u00a0months, respectively. Several non-neoformans/gattii species were identified among the renal dialysis recipients with cryptococcosis, particularly Cryptococcus laurentii and Cryptococcus albidus, which share similar clinical manifestations as those caused by C. neoformans and C. gattii. Our analyses suggest that physicians should consider the possibility of the occurrence of cryptococcosis among renal dialysis recipients even when cryptococcal antigen test result is negative. The timely removal of the catheter is crucial for peritoneal dialysis patients with cryptococcosis. In addition, there is a need for optimized antifungal treatment strategy in renal dialysis recipients with cryptococcal infections."

The images were also investigated for pulp canal calcification, pulp stones, soft tissue calcification, changes in or loss of lamina dura, radiolucencies associated with brown tumour and ridge resorption. The indices were compared between the three groups and were investigated for association with the patients' blood test parameters and their diseases causing chronic renal failure (CRF). Intraobserver agreement for the 2-week interval of assessment was calculated for the indices.MI (<i>p</i> = 0.574) and PMI (<i>p</i> = 0.100) were not significantly different, but AI (<i>p</i> = 0.01), MCI (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and TP (<i>p</i> = 0.002) were significantly different between the two case groups and the control group. The prevalence of pulp calcification (<i>p</i> = 0.03) and ridge resorption (<i>p</i> = 0.005) was higher in the haemodialysis group. Soft tissue calcification (<i>p</i> = 0.85) and lamina dura changes (<i>p</i> = 0.9) showed no significant difference. Brown tumours were observed in only one case in the haemodialysis group.AI, MCI and TP showed a reduction in mineral density of the cortical and trabecular bone in CRF patients and more severely in patients under haemodialysis than those under peritoneal dialysis."

The aim of this study is to assess differences in prevalence and symptom dimensions of anxiety and depression between patients receiving peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis.Baseline data from the Depression Related Factors and Outcomes in Dialysis Patients With Various Ethnicities and Races Study were used. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured with the Beck Anxiety Inventory and Beck Depression Inventory- second edition. Linear and logistic regression models were used to compare anxiety and depression total scores and somatic and subjective/cognitive symptom dimension scores between patients receiving peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis, adjusted for potential confounders.In total, 84 patients receiving peritoneal dialysis and 601 patients receiving haemodialysis were included. Clinically significant symptoms of anxiety and depression were present in respectively 22% and 43% of the patients, with no differences between dialysis modality. Both modalities scored high on the somatic symptom dimensions and on individual somatic items. Almost all patients reported symptoms related to loss of energy and sleep.No differences in symptom dimensions of anxiety and depression were found between patients receiving peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis. The high prevalence of somatic symptom dimensions in both groups underscores the possible interaction between somatic and psychiatric symptoms in dialysis patients and the need for early recognition and treatment of symptoms of anxiety and depression regardless of treatment modalities."

Pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure (SBP) more than 160\u2009mmHg was thought to be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. The present study was performed to explore the clinical characteristics and management of hemodialysis patients with pre-dialysis SBP \u2265 160\u2009mmHg.A total of 1233 patients undergoing hemodialysis from nine hemodialysis centers were enrolled. Pre-dialysis and home BP were measured and clinical data were collected. The characteristics of patients with pre-dialysis SBP \u2265 160\u2009mmHg were explored. Clinical parameters between hypertensive and non-hypertensive patients were compared. The partial correlation analyses performed to identify the associations between BP and clinical parameters.There were 24.6% of the hemodialysis patients had pre-dialysis SBP \u2265 160\u2009mmHg and the average SBP was 173.8\u2009\u00b1\u200910.9\u2009mmHg. Only 21.4% of the patients achieved dry weight after dialysis and up to 30.2% of patients were not given combination therapies of antihypertensive drugs. Compared to patients with pre-hemodialysis SBP < 160\u2009mmHg, patients with pre-dialysis SBP \u2265 160\u2009mmHg had lower target-reaching rate of Kt/v and higher incidences of intradialytic hypotension and muscle spasm. Most patients (96%) with pre-dialysis SBP \u2265 160\u2009mmHg had home SBP\u2265 135\u2009mmHg. Patients with home SBP \u2265 160\u2009mmHg had higher left ventricular weight index and lower hemoglobin levels when compared to their counterparts with home SBP <160\u2009mmHg.Pre-dialysis SBP \u2265 160\u2009mmHg is common in clinical practice and most of the patients could diagnosed to be hypertensive according to their home SBP. Patients with pre-dialysis SBP \u2265 160\u2009mmHg are more likely to be subjected to dialysis insufficiency and intradialytic complications. Achieving dry weight and sufficient pharmacologic interventions should be strengthened to improve BP control in the hemodialysis population."

To improve the understanding of transmission risks in six Scottish renal dialysis units, we utilised the rapid whole-genome sequencing data generated by the COG-UK consortium.We combined geographical, temporal and genomic sequence data from the community and hospital to estimate the probability of infection originating from within the dialysis unit, the hospital or the community using Bayesian statistical modelling and compared these results to the details of epidemiological investigations.Of 671 patients, 60 (8.9%) became infected with SARS-CoV-2, of whom 16 (27%) died. Within-unit and community transmission were both evident and an instance of transmission from the wider hospital setting was also demonstrated.Near-real-time SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data can facilitate tailored infection prevention and control measures, which can be targeted at reducing risk in these settings."

    "content": "The epidemic wave that hit Italy from February 21st, 2020, when the Italian National Institute of Health confirmed the first case of SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 infection, led to a rapid and efficient reorganization of Dialysis Centers' activities, in order to contain large-scale spread of disease in this clinical setting. We herein report the experience of the Hemodialysis Unit of Parma University Hospital (Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria, Parma, Italy) and the Dialysis Centers of Parma territory, in the period from March 1st, 2020 to June 15, 2020. Among patients undergoing chronic haemodialysis, 37/283 (13%) had positive swabs for SARS\u2011CoV\u20112, 9/37 (24%) died because of COVID-19. Twenty-three patients required hospitalization, while the remaining were managed at home. The primary measures applied to contain the infection were: the strengthening of personal protective equipment use by doctors and nurses, early identification of infected subjects by performing oro-pharyngeal swabs in every patient and in the healthcare personnel, the institution of a triage protocol when entering Dialysis Room, and finally the institution of two separate sections, managed by different doctors and dialysis nurses, to physically separate affected from unaffected patients and to manage \"grey\" patients. Our experience highlights the importance and effectiveness of afore-mentioned measures in order to contain the spread of the virus; moreover, we observed a higher lethality rate of COVID-19 in dialysis patients as compared to the general population."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "This study attempts to develop and determine the effect a rational-emotive-behaviour-therapy-based self-management programme can have on the self-efficacy, self-care, depression and dyssomnia of patients undergoing early renal dialysis.When renal dialysis is initiated, changes in everyday life are inevitable, and patients can suffer from both psychological and physical symptoms. Hence, to obtain the best results from renal dialysis, active self-management is required.Quasi-experimental and longitudinal.Forty-eight early-stage renal dialysis patients registered for and undergoing renal dialysis at a hospital located in S city participated in this study.\u00a0These individuals were divided into an experimental and control group. The former group engaged in a self-management programme consisting of eight weekly sessions of 50\u00a0min in duration, while the latter received traditional nursing care. Data were collected from June 2012-May 2014 through the use of a preliminary survey, a postsurvey that was distributed after the eight sessions of the self-management programme had been completed, and a follow-up survey allocated 4\u00a0weeks after the postsurvey. Data collection was conducted using the Self-efficacy Scale, Self-care Practice Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, and Korean Sleep Scale, and a repeated-measures ANOVA was used to perform analysis.The experimental group significantly differed from the control group in regard to self-efficacy (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006) and self-care (p\u00a0=\u00a00.031), but differences in terms of depression (p\u00a0=\u00a00.492) and dyssomnia (p\u00a0=\u00a00.141) were nonsignificant. In the experimental group, the depression decreased but then increased again, while the dyssomnia gradually decreased.The provision of a rational-emotive-behaviour-therapy-based self-management programme that involves lectures, discussions, teach-backs, demonstrations and posters explaining diet choices improves the self-efficacy and self-care of patients receiving renal dialysis.Rational-emotive-behaviour-therapy-based self-management programmes can be used in clinical nursing sites to improve the self-efficacy and self-care of early renal dialysis patients."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Despite a higher prevalence of chronic kidney disease among women, more men than women start renal replacement therapy (RRT). We hypothesized that gender differences in health care access exist and therefore aimed at determining whether characteristics and outcomes of haemodialysis patients over time differ by sex.We studied all 28\u00a0323 adults who began haemodialysis during 1965-2014 in the Austrian Dialysis Registry, analysing trends in patient characteristics by sex and decade with mortality (via Cox regression), which was compared with the mortality of the Austrian general population.More men than women started haemodialysis (60.1% men versus 39.9% women overall), with minor differences among decades and age groups. The male:female mortality rate ratio in the general population ranged from 1.2 to 2.4 for age groups >18\u2009years and in haemodialysis patients ranged from 0.80 to 1.3 (closer to 1 than in the general population, but consistently >1 in Decades 3-5). In recent decades, diabetes and hypertension replaced glomerulonephritis as the primary cause of end-stage renal disease in both men and women. Interaction analyses showed the mortality risk associated with haemodialysis access (only recorded in Decade 5) was significantly lower for men than for women.The male:female mortality rate ratio and the proportion of women starting haemodialysis were remarkably stable, which does not support the hypothesis of gender differences in health care/haemodialysis access or could imply that such differences might have persisted over decades. Future research should expand to other countries and other forms of RRT."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "The purpose of this study was to analyze the all-cause mortality rate over time after elderly hip fracture in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients with dialysis, using a Korean nationwide claims database.This retrospective nationwide study identified subjects from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-Senior cohort (NHIS-Senior). The NHIS-Senior (total of 588,147 participants) was constructed by 10% random sampling and was designed to represent the elderly living in Korea. Subjects were patients aged 65-99 years who underwent surgical treatment for femoral neck fractures or intertrochanteric fractures. A generalized estimating equation model with Poisson distribution and logarithmic link function was used to estimate adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to measure associations between renal dialysis and cumulative mortality in various time frames.The total number of patients included in this study was 16,818. These patients were divided into two groups: 116 (0.69%) in the dialysis group and 16,702 (99.31%) in the no-dialysis group. The mean length of hospital stay was 43.87 \u00b1 48.45 days in the dialysis group and 36.29 \u00b1 37.49 days in the no-dialysis group (<i>P</i> = 0.095). The effect of renal dialysis on all-cause mortality was 2.29-fold (aRR; 95% CI, 1.29-4.06; <i>P</i> = 0.005) within 30 days and 1.72-fold (aRR; 95% CI, 1.34-2.21; <i>P</i> < 0.001) within 1-year after hip fracture compared to the no-dialysis group. And, the effect of renal dialysis of in-hospital mortality was 2.72-fold (aRR; 95% CI, 1.71-4.33; <i>P</i> < 0.001) compared to the no-dialysis group.Elderly patients who underwent dialysis have very high mortality rates after hip fracture. Therefore, it is considered that postoperative care through multidisciplinary management and understanding of pathophysiology for the ESRD patients is necessary."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "The extension of the interdialytic interval due to due to dialysis session non-attendance varies according to which session of the week the patient misses. The impact of this on subsequent hospitalization and mortality is unknown.The ARO cohort study prospectively collected data from hemodialysis patients across 15 European countries on demography, comorbidity, laboratory, hospitalisation, mortality and individual hemodialysis sessions from 2007 to 2014. Event rates for death and hospitalisation according to dialysis day of the week were calculated for patients who attended the three previous scheduled hemodialysis sessions, who then on the next scheduled dialysis day either attended or did not attend. The hazard ratio for these events following non-attendance for the first compared to the second dialysis session of the week was estimated using Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for patient demographics.3.8 million hemodialysis sessions in 9397 patients were analysed. The non-attendance rates for Monday/Wednesday/Friday sessions were 0.8, 0.9% & 1.4% respectively, and for Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday sessions were 0.6, 1.0% & 1.2% respectively. Compared to those who attended, for the 48-72\u2009h between non-attendance and the next scheduled haemodialysis session, mortality significantly increased from 4.86 to 51.9/100\u2009pt-yrs and hospitalisation increased from 0.58 to 2.1/yr. As time from the two-day break increased, the risk associated with non-attendance lessened: compared to missing the second hemodialysis session, missing the first session had a hazard ratio for mortality of 2.04 (95% CI 1.27-3.29), and for hospitalisation 1.78 (95% CI 1.29-2.47). In patients who attended their scheduled dialysis session and the three preceding, after the two-day break there were absolute increases in mortality (8.3 vs. 4.9/100\u2009pt-yrs) and hospitalisation (1.0 vs. 0.6/yr for the rest of the week) comparable to previous studies.In addition to hospitalisation and mortality increases seen after the two-day break, additional harm may be manifested in the greater increases in mortality and hospitalisation observed after non-attendance for the first hemodialysis session after the two-day break compared to missing other sessions."

    "content": "Pulmonary artery hypertension is a serious comorbidityof dialysis in patients with end-stage renal disease. The prevalence of dialysis-induced pulmonary artery hypertension is still a subject of debate. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of pulmonary artery hypertension in patients undergoing hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.This cross-sectional study was conducted on patients undergoing either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis in Montaserieh Dialysis Center in Mashhad, Iran during 2015 and 2016. Pulmonary artery pressure, ejection fraction, and serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, creatinine, and parathyroid hormone were measured.A total of 50 patients (25 on hemodialysis and 25 on peritoneal dialysis) participated in the study. The mean age of the participants was 34 \u00b1 12 years. The mean pulmonary artery pressure was significantly higher in the hemodialysis group compared to the peritoneal dialysis group (P < .001). Serum calcium was significantly higher in the peritoneal dialysis group compared (P = .04). Pulmonary artery hypertension was observed in 11 patients (22%), all of whom were in the hemodialysis group. There was a significant negative relationship between serum calcium and pulmonary artery pressure (P< .01). Hemodialysis was significantly related to higher pulmonary artery pressure (P < .001).This study revealed a high prevalence of pulmonary artery hypertension among end-stage renal disease patients undergoing dialysis. This study also found a novel significant negative relationship between serum calcium level and pulmonary artery pressure, and hemodialysis was found to be significantly related to higher pulmonary artery pressure."

    "content": "Intradialytic hypotension is a clinically relevant complication in haemodialysis patients. Pre-dialysis diastolic blood pressure is routinely measured. However, the association between pre-dialysis diastolic blood pressure and intradialytic hypotension is not well understood.Patient-level (N\u2009=\u2009545) and haemodialysis session-level (N\u2009=\u20093261) data were collected; the exposure variable was pre-dialysis diastolic blood pressure. The primary outcome of interest was the development of intradialytic hypotension, defined as any nadir\u2009<\u2009100\u00a0mmHg if the pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure was\u2009\u2265\u2009160\u00a0mmHg, or any nadir\u2009<\u200990\u00a0mmHg if the pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure was\u2009<\u2009160\u00a0mmHg. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using mixed-effects logistic regression for the association between pre-dialysis diastolic blood pressure and intradialytic hypotension, after adjusting for potential confounders.Intradialytic hypotension occurred in 14.4% of the sessions. All sessions were divided into five categories according to pre-dialysis diastolic blood pressure. The adjusted ORs for intradialytic hypotension were 2.72 (95% CI 1.64-4.51), 1.07 (95% CI 0.68-1.66), 1.68 (95% CI 1.08-2.62), and 1.81 (95% CI 1.05-3.14) in sessions with pre-dialysis diastolic blood pressure of\u2009<\u200960\u00a0mmHg,\u2009\u2265\u200960 to\u2009<\u200970\u00a0mmHg,\u2009\u2265\u200980 to\u2009<\u200990\u00a0mmHg, and\u2009\u2265\u200990\u00a0mmHg, respectively, compared with the reference pre-dialysis diastolic blood pressure of\u2009\u2265\u200970 to\u2009<\u200980\u00a0mmHg. Cubic spline analyses revealed a reverse J-shaped association between pre-dialysis diastolic blood pressure and intradialytic hypotension.Low and high pre-dialysis diastolic blood pressure levels were associated with intradialytic hypotension. This may help identify patients at a high risk of developing intradialytic hypotension."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Immigrants often work in jobs that are known as dirty, demanding, and dangerous. Globally, the agricultural occupations have been associated with the emergence of chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) primarily in outdoor worker populations. The disease has also been reported in immigrants in the United States who work in agricultural occupations, but little research has been done outside of agricultural workers to determine whether immigrants who work other occupations are at risk for developing CKDu.This study assessed the self-reported occupational histories of undocumented immigrants receiving frequent, emergent-only dialysis in Atlanta, GA. We assessed demographics, employment status, and work history, using the Grady Dialysis Questionnaire and the Occupational/Environmental Health History Form.Fifty undocumented immigrants receiving frequent, emergent-only hemodialysis were recruited for this study. The average age was 49.5 years (<i>SD</i> \u00b1 11.5), and the majority (52%) were female and originated from Mexico (66%). A majority (74%) reported having worked in the past 5 years and 28% reported currently working. A total of 68 unique jobs were reported. In decreasing order of frequency, our sample worked in occupations with documented renal toxicant exposures, such as applying pesticides in landscaping, heat exposure in agriculture, construction, landscaping, and dry cleaning, and lead paint fumes in construction.Occupational histories provide a greater understanding of the exposures and working conditions of those receiving frequent, emergent-only hemodialysis. This exploratory study suggests that further research is needed to investigate and assess whether renal toxicants are associated with occupations with high numbers of undocumented workers.A detailed and thorough occupational history should be conducted from those receiving frequent, emergent-only hemodialysis. Developing continuing education for nursing and medical staff in dialysis centers on taking an occupational history, mandatory State reporting requirements, and hazard communication training for workers should be considered. Collaborations between occupational health professionals, public health authorities, employers, dialysis providers, and clinicians who see undocumented workers is required to understand and develop appropriate prevention measures for this population."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "The effect of dialysis dose on mortality remains unsettled. Current guidelines recommend targeting a single-pool Kt/V (spKt/V) at 1.20-1.40 per thrice-weekly dialysis session. However, the optimal dialysis dose remains mostly disputed.In a nationwide registry of all incident patients receiving thrice-weekly haemodialysis, 32\u2009283 patients had available data on dialysis dose, estimated by Kt/V and its variants epuration volume per session (Kt) and Kt indexed to body surface area (Kt/A). Survival was analysed with a multivariate Cox model and a concurrent risk model accounting for renal transplantation. A predictive model of Kt in the upper quartile was developed.Regardless of the indicator, a higher dose of dialysis was consistently associated with better survival. The survival differential of Kt was the most discriminating, but marginally, compared with the survival differential according to Kt/V and Kt/A. Patient survival was higher in the upper quartile of Kt (>69\u2009L/session) then deteriorated as the Kt decreased, with a difference in survival between the upper and lower quartile of 23.6% at 5\u2009years. Survival differences across Kt distribution were similar after accounting for kidney transplantation as a competing risk. Predictive factors for Kt in the upper quartile were arteriovenous fistula versus catheters and graft, haemodiafiltration versus haemodialysis, scheduled dialysis start versus emergency start, long weekly dialysis duration and spKt/V measurement versus double-pool equilibrated Kt/V.Our data confirm the existence of a relationship between dialysis dose and survival that persisted despite correcting for known confounders. A model for predicting a high dose of dialysis is proposed with practical relevance."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "It is well established that end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality both in the adult and pediatric population. Although the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood, compromised nitric oxide (NO) bioactivity has been suggested as a contributing factor. With this in mind, we investigated the effects of hemodialysis on NO homeostasis and bioactivity in blood.Plasma and dialysate samples were obtained before and after hemodialysis sessions from adults (n\u00a0=\u00a033) and pediatric patients (n\u00a0=\u00a010) with ESRD on chronic renal replacement therapy, and from critically ill adults with acute kidney injury (n\u00a0=\u00a012) at their first sustained low-efficiency dialysis session. Levels of nitrate, nitrite, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and amino acids relevant for NO homeostasis were analyzed. We consistently found that nitrate and cGMP levels in plasma were significantly reduced after hemodialysis, whereas post-dialysis nitrite and amino acids coupled to NO synthase activity (i.e., arginine and citrulline) were only significantly reduced in adults with ESRD. The amount of excreted nitrate and nitrite during dialysis were similar to daily endogenous levels that would be expected from endothelial NO synthase activity.Our results show that hemodialysis significantly reduces circulating levels of nitrate and cGMP, indicating that this medical procedure may impair NO synthesis and potentially NO signaling pathways."

Incidence rates and hazard ratios (HRs) of lower extremity amputation, and subsequent 30-day mortality after amputation were evaluated up to 31 December 2011.There were 2427 and 216 patients undergoing lower extremity amputation during follow-up in the HD and PD groups with incidence rates of 8.35 and 5.79 per 1000 person-years, respectively. Compared with the HD group, the overall adjusted HR of lower extremity amputation for the PD group was 1.27 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.10-1.46). The impact of diabetes status on the risk of lower extremity amputation interacted with dialysis modality significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Compared with the corresponding HD patients, the PD patients with diabetes had an adjusted HR of 1.44 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.24-1.67) for amputation, whereas those without diabetes had an adjusted HR of 0.58 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.36-0.95). The subsequent 30-day mortality rates after amputation were not significantly different between the HD and PD groups (8.45% vs. 9.72%) with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.41 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.87-2.28, PD versus HD).Compared with corresponding HD patients, the amputation risk is higher for PD patients with diabetes, while the risk is lower for PD patients without diabetes. Dialysis patients have a high 30-day mortality risk after amputation."

    "content": "This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of haemodialysis (HD), continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in Singapore.A Markov model was developed to examine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of HD, CAPD and APD over the 10-year time horizon from the societal perspective, using clinical data from an observational study and the national renal registry, utilities from published studies and costs from dialysis services providers. The base-case analysis was for a hypothetical cohort of 60-year-old non-diabetic ESRD patients. A high-risk group of 60-year-old diabetic ESRD patients was also studied.In the base-case analysis, the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were 3.27 with CAPD, 3.48 with APD and 4.69 with HD. The total costs were Singapore dollar $169\u2009872 for CAPD, $201\u2009509 for APD and $306\u2009827 for HD. CAPD and HD had extended dominance over APD. The ICER of HD versus CAPD was $96\u2009447 (US$69\u2009121) per QALY. One-way sensitivity analyses indicated that the results were most sensitive to the utility of HD. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that CAPD had the maximum probability of being cost-effective among treatments under evaluation at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $60\u2009000 (US$43\u2009000) per QALY. The high-risk group analyses showed similar results. The ICER of HD versus CAPD was $106\u2009281 (US$76\u2009168) per QALY and the probability of CAPD being optimal was the highest using the same WTP threshold.Our analysis suggested that starting dialysis with CAPD is most cost-effective for ESRD patients in Singapore."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "BACKGROUND Hypertension is a common complication of renal dialysis and is inadequately controlled in approximately one-third of patients. Intravascular renal denervation is an option to control sympathetic overdrive and decrease blood pressure. Four renal dialysis patients are presented with uncontrolled hypertension who were treated with intravascular renal denervation. CASE REPORT In a renal dialysis unit, patients were screened for therapy-resistant hypertension, which was defined as an outpatient blood pressure >160/100 mmHg and a blood pressure by interdialytic ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) >130/80 mmHg. Four patients were identified with a mean ABPM of 175/95 mmHg. The four patients included a 24-year-old man with neurogenic bladder undergoing hemodialysis; a 55-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus undergoing peritoneal dialysis; a 56-year-old woman with a history of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) undergoing peritoneal dialysis; and a 72-year-old man with a history of ADPKD undergoing hemodialysis Following intravascular renal denervation, one patient had antihypertensive medicines withdrawn at 12 months, and he remained normotensive up to renal transplantation at 24 months. In two patients, ABPM did not decrease until renal transplantation was performed. The fourth patient was not a candidate for renal transplantation, and he was also a non-responder for intravascular renal denervation. None of the patients experienced hypotension or other adverse events following intravascular renal denervation. CONCLUSIONS A case series of four patients showed that, for some patients who have unresponsive hypertension while on renal dialysis, intravascular renal denervation is a safe procedure."

Twenty men aged between 20 and 59 years (<i>Mean<sub>age</sub></i> = 40.65 yrs; <i>SD</i> = 12.52) participated in the study. Participants were recruited purposefully. Data were collected over a period of 4 months through in-depth face-to-face interviews and analyzed using the Interpretative Phenomenological Analytical method. The following three key themes were extracted from the interviews: (a) the emotional pain and fear of death following a diagnosis of ESRD; (b) living on dialysis interferes with the management and handling of \"manly\" responsibilities and duties and, (c) dialysis as a challenging yet life-saving measure. The findings further suggest that renal dialysis has an impact on men's sense of masculinity and has the potential to complicate the management of renal failure. The paper concludes by recommending that cultural and community factors be taken into account when considering interventions to manage the health of men living with renal conditions."

    "content": "To evaluate the effect of haemodialysis on doravirine concentrations in people living with HIV (PLWH) undergoing routine haemodialysis.An exploratory clinical trial that included PLWH undergoing intermittent haemodialysis was undertaken. After enrolment (day 1), doravirine 100\u2005mg once daily was added to stable combined ART for 5\u2005days. On day 6, blood samples were collected from each participant at the beginning and at the end of a dialysis session. Additionally, paired samples of blood entering ('in') and leaving ('out') the dialyser and the resulting dialysate were collected during the dialysis session to evaluate drug removal during dialysis. Doravirine concentrations in plasma and in the dialysate were determined by LC-MS/MS. The ratio of doravirine concentrations in plasma after/before the haemodialysis session and the haemodialysis extraction coefficient were calculated for each participant. The study was registered at https://www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04689737).Eight participants (six male) were included. The median (range) age and BMI were 49.5 (28-67) years and 23.6 (17.9-34.2) kg/m2, respectively. The doravirine dialysis extraction ratio was 34.3% (25.8%-41.4%). The ratio of doravirine concentrations in plasma after/before the haemodialysis session was 0.8 (0.6-1.0). At the end of the haemodialysis session (time post-dose 20.8-27.3\u2005h), doravirine concentrations in plasma were 785 (101-1851) ng/mL.Despite moderate removal of doravirine by haemodialysis, trough doravirine concentrations in plasma after the haemodialysis sessions remained in excess of the protein-binding-adjusted EC50 (5\u2005ng/mL). Doravirine dosage adjustments are unnecessary in PLWH undergoing intermittent haemodialysis."

Age \u226518 years, chronic kidney disease progressing to DDKD and urine output \u2265500\u2009mL/day are key inclusion criteria; patients with left ventricular ejection fraction <30%\u2009and acute kidney injury requiring dialysis will be excluded. Adjuvant pharmacological therapy (ie, effective diuretic regimen, patiromer and sodium bicarbonate) will complement twice-weekly HD. The primary feasibility end points are recruitment rate, adherence to the assigned HD regimen, adherence to serial timed urine collections and treatment contamination. Incidence rate of clinically significant volume overload and metabolic imbalances in the first 3 months after randomisation will be used to assess intervention safety.The study has been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Wake Forest School of Medicine in North Carolina, USA. Patient recruitment began on 14 June 2019, was paused between 13 March 2020 and 31 May 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic, resumed on 01 June 2020 and will last until the required sample size has been attained. Participants will be followed in usual care fashion for a minimum of 6 months from last individual enrolled. All regulations and measures of ethics and confidentiality are handled in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.NCT03740048; Pre-results."

    "content": "Present investigation aims to elucidate safety and efficacy of hemodialysis as well as peritoneal dialysis in treating end-stage diabetic nephropathy.We searched various databases for articles from the database starting date to October 2019. The analysis involved studies that contained outcomes of hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis in the treatment of end-stage diabetic nephropathy. A total of 12 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 932 participants were collected.Meta-analysis results suggested that comparing with peritoneal dialysis group, hemodialysis group had a higher incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and bleeding complications. There was no statistically significant difference regarding the infection (P\u2009=\u20090.71) or malnutrition (P\u2009=\u20090.53) incidence between the two forms of dialysis. Hemodialysis could better improve the levels of albumin [mean difference (MD)\u2009=\u20096.80, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009(4.17-9.44)] and hemoglobin [MD\u2009=\u20093.40, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009(0.94-5.86)] than peritoneal dialysis after 3\u00a0months or more.In treating end-stage diabetic nephropathy patients, peritoneal dialysis had a lower incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, as well as bleeding complication than hemodialysis. However, hemodialysis could better improve albumin and hemoglobin levels than peritoneal dialysis after 3\u00a0months."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Kidney failure prevalence is increasing worldwide. Haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis or kidney transplantation are undertaken to extend life with kidney failure. People receiving haemodialysis commonly experience fatigue, pain, nausea, cramping, itching, sleeping difficulties, anxiety and depression. This symptom burden contributes to poor health-related quality of life (QOL) and is a major reason for treatment withdrawal and death. The Symptom monitoring WIth Feedback Trial (SWIFT) will test the hypothesis that regular symptom monitoring with feedback to people receiving haemodialysis and their treating clinical team can improve QOL.We are conducting an Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant (ANZDATA) registry-based cluster randomised controlled trial to determine the clinical- and cost-effectiveness at 12 months, of 3-monthly symptom monitoring using the Integrated Palliative Outcome Scale-Renal (IPOS-Renal) survey with clinician feedback, compared with usual care among adults treated with haemodialysis. Participants complete symptom scoring using a tablet, which are provided to participants and to clinicians. The trial aims to recruit 143 satellite haemodialysis centres, (up to 2400 participants). The primary outcome is change in health-related QOL, as measured by EuroQol 5-Dimension, 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) instrument. Secondary outcomes include overall survival, symptom severity (including haemodialysis-associated fatigue), healthcare utilisation and cost-effectiveness.SWIFT is the first registry-based trial in the Australian haemodialysis population to investigate whether regular symptom monitoring with feedback to participants and clinicians improves QOL. SWIFT is embedded in the ANZDATA Registry facilitating pragmatic recruitment from public and private dialysis clinics, throughout Australia. SWIFT will inform future collection, storage and reporting of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) within a clinical quality registry. As the first trial to rigorously estimate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of routine PROMs collection and reporting in haemodialysis units, SWIFT will provide invaluable information to health services, clinicians and researchers working to improve the lives of those with kidney failure.Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12620001061921 .

    "content": "We report the first worldwide experience with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) in children using the last generation Cardio-Renal Pediatric Dialysis Emergency Machine (CARPEDIEM)TM device. Thirteen children received 1,008 h of CVVHD during 95 sessions, using a 0.15 (n = 7) or a 0.25 m2 (n = 6) hemofilter. The median weight was 3 kg (interquartile range [IQR] 2.5-6.2). In 10 patients, CVVHD was conducted using a 5 Fr double-lumen central vascular access, whereas in 3 children, bigger sizes were used (6.5 and 8 Ch). The median prescribed Qb was 17 mL/min (IQR 10-29.5), with a median Qd of 10 mL/min. Circuits were primed with 5% albumin in 12 out of 13 patients, using anticoagulation with heparin in all 13 cases. The median delivered/prescribed time ratio yielded a 100% result (95-100%). The most common cause for \"downtime\" was clotting that however occurred in only 3% of all treatments. Survivals at continuous renal replacement therapy discontinuation and ICU discharge were 100 and 69% respectively. The CARPEDIEMTM machine allowed successful delivery of diffusive blood purification modality to very small patients, using small catheters, no blood primes, and excellent concordance between delivered and prescribed treatment duration."

Studies have shown hypertension and diabetes as the leading causes of chronic kidney disease. The aim of this study is to find out the prevalence of end-stage renal disease patients undergoing haemodialysis in a tertiary care hospital.This was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted among 96 patients undergoing haemodialysis from February 13, 2021 to April 4, 2021 in the hemodialysis unit of a tertiary care centre after receiving ethical clearance from the Institutional Review Committee (Reference number: 354). Convenience sampling was done and all patients older than 18 years who were on maintenance haemodialysis on an outpatient basis were included in the study. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Data were analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Science version 22.0. Point estimate at 95% Confidence Interval was calculated along with frequency and percentages for binary data and mean with standard deviation for continuous data.Among 96 patients undergoing haemodialysis, the prevalence of end-stage renal disease was 83 (86.45%) (79.60-93.30 at 95% Confidence Interval). The most common underlying condition was hypertensive nephropathy in 34 (40.96%) patients, followed by both hypertensive and diabetic nephropathy in 26 (31.33%) patients.The prevalence of end-stage renal disease in our study was higher when compared to similar studies conducted in similar settings. Early diagnosis and adequate treatment of hypertension and diabetes could be crucial to reducing the prevalence of the end-stage renal disease.chronic kidney failure; chronic renal insufficiency; end stage renal disease; hemodialysis; Nepal."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who require urgent initiation of dialysis but without having a permanent dialysis access have traditionally commenced haemodialysis (HD) using a central venous catheter (CVC). However, several studies have reported that urgent initiation of peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a viable alternative option for such patients.This review aimed to examine the benefits and harms of urgent-start PD compared to HD initiated using a CVC in adults and children with CKD requiring long-term kidney replacement therapy.We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 25 May 2020 for randomised controlled trials through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. For non-randomised controlled trials, MEDLINE (OVID) (1946 to 11 February 2020) and EMBASE (OVID) (1980 to 11 February 2020) were searched.All randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and non-RCTs comparing urgent-start PD to HD initiated using a CVC.Two authors extracted data and assessed the quality of studies independently. Additional information was obtained from the primary investigators. The estimates of effect were analysed using random-effects model and results were presented as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The GRADE framework was used to make judgments regarding certainty of the evidence for each outcome.Overall, seven observational studies (991 participants) were included: three prospective cohort studies and four retrospective cohort studies. All the outcomes except one (bacteraemia) were graded as very low certainty of evidence given that all included studies were observational studies and few events resulting in imprecision, and inconsistent findings. Urgent-start PD may reduce the incidence of catheter-related bacteraemia compared with HD initiated with a CVC (2 studies, 301 participants: RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.41; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; low certainty evidence), which translated into 131 fewer bacteraemia episodes per 1000 (95% CI 89 to 145 fewer). Urgent-start PD has uncertain effects on peritonitis risk (2 studies, 301 participants: RR 1.78, 95% CI 0.23 to 13.62; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; very low certainty evidence), exit-site/tunnel infection (1 study, 419 participants: RR 3.99, 95% CI 1.2 to 12.05; very low certainty evidence), exit-site bleeding (1 study, 178 participants: RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.33; very low certainty evidence), catheter malfunction (2 studies; 597 participants: RR 0.26, 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.91; I<sup>2</sup> = 66%; very low certainty evidence), catheter re-adjustment (2 studies, 225 participants: RR: 0.13; 95% CI 0.00 to 18.61; I<sup>2</sup> = 92%; very low certainty evidence), technique survival (1 study, 123 participants: RR: 1.18, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.61; very low certainty evidence), or patient survival (5 studies, 820 participants; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.07; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; very low certainty evidence) compared with HD initiated using a CVC. Two studies using different methods of measurements for hospitalisation reported that hospitalisation was similar although one study reported higher hospitalisation rates in HD initiated using a catheter compared with urgent-start PD.Compared with HD initiated using a CVC, urgent-start PD may reduce the risk of bacteraemia and had uncertain effects on other complications of dialysis and technique and patient survival. In summary, there are very few studies directly comparing the outcomes of urgent-start PD and HD initiated using a CVC for patients with CKD who need to commence dialysis urgently. This evidence gap needs to be addressed in future studies."

    "content": "Despite national descriptions of awareness, knowledge, and perceptions about the exposure to the biological risk among nurses employed in renal-dialysis care are pivotal to increase work safety, there is a paucity of data on these descriptions in the Italian context. This study aimed at describing Italian nurses' awareness and knowledge about biological risk in delivering care for renal-dialysis patients, and their experiences of biological accidents.A pilot survey using cross-sectional data collection and convenience sampling procedure. 124 nurses were enrolled receiving a 7-item questionnaire: Questions 1, 2, and 7 were referred to the awareness about educational learning needs, questions 3 and 4 explored nurses' knowledge about biological risk, questions 5 and 6 collected accident-related information.Overall, nurses' awareness and knowledge about biological risk appeared almost limited. Surprisingly, 52% of the enrolled nurses experienced a biological accident, and 29.5% reported to know colleagues who developed work-related disease after a biological accident. We found positive significant associations between awareness and knowledge.This pilot study highlighted the need to further describe Italian nurses' awareness and knowledge about biological risk in delivering care for renal-dialysis patients, as well as the need of up-to-date epidemiological description about biological accidents. Accordingly, future studies are highly recommended to provide robust evidence aimed at supporting policy makers, educators, clinicians, regulators, and managers."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Although high-volume online hemodiafiltration has been associated with higher clearance and lower pre-dialysis concentration of middle molecular weight toxins compared to hemodialysis, its effect on protein-bound uremic toxins has shown inconclusive results. In this study, we investigated whether hemodiafiltration impacts pre-dialysis plasma levels of the toxins indoxyl sulfate, p-cresyl sulfate, and indole-3-acetic acid compared to high-flux hemodialysis.This is a post-hoc analysis of the multicenter, randomized controlled trial HDFit (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02787161). Uremic toxins were determined by high performance liquid chromatography at baseline, 3, and 6\u00a0months. Mean differences in monthly changes of pre-dialysis uremic toxin concentrations between hemodiafiltration and high-flux hemodialysis were analyzed using linear mixed-effect models.One hundred ninety-three patients (mean age 53\u00a0years old, 71% males) were analyzed. There were no differences between groups regarding clinical and biochemical characteristics at baseline or duration of dialysis session and blood flows throughout the follow-up. Mean differences in rates of change (\u03bcM/month, [confidence interval CI]) in high-flux hemodialysis vs. hemodiafiltration were 2.4 [0.3 to 4.56], 3.94 [-\u20091.54 to 9.41] and 0.06 [-\u20090.6 to 0.5] for indoxyl sulfate, p-cresyl sulfate and indole-3-acetic acid, respectively. In the exploratory analysis, these differences in high-flux hemodialysis vs. hemodiafiltration subgroup with convective volume\u2009>\u200927.5\u00a0L were 2.86 [0.43 to 5.28], 7.43 [0.7 to 14.16] and -\u20090.19 [-\u20090.88 to 0.50].These exploratory findings suggest that hemodiafiltration is more effective in reducing indoxyl sulfate as compared to standard high-flux hemodialysis, and also that this effect was extended to p-cresyl sulfate in patients achieving higher convective volumes."

Analyses included determination of conductivity, fluoride, nitrate and sulphate; test for total coliform bacteria; count of heterotrophic bacteria; count and identification of non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli (NFGNB); drug susceptibility test; biofilm formation capacity; and genetic similarity among some isolated NFGNB. Of the analysed samples, only 4/72 (5.6%) had conductivity values \u226510 mS/cm, 4/216 (1.9%) presented total coliforms and 1/216 (0.5%) had heterotrophic bacteria count >100\u00a0CFU/ml. NFGNB were isolated from 99/216 (45.8%) samples, and the major identified micro-organisms included Herbaspirillum aquaticum/huttiense, Brevundimonas aurantiaca, Cupriavidus metallidurans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Ralstonia insidiosa. Isolates of P. aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia complex were sensitive to most antimicrobials and, together with isolates of Ralstonia insidiosa and Ralstonia pickettii, showed strong biofilm formation capacity. Some isolates expressed the same electrophoretic profile on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, indicating the persistence of bacterial clones in the systems over time.NFGNB were observed in several dialysis water and dialysate samples from all investigated centres, which may represent a risk to the health of patients.Regular inclusion of actions for NFGNB control and monitoring in haemodialysis fluids are suggested for greater safety of the dialytic process."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "There are three principle forms of vascular access available for the treatment of children with end stage kidney disease (ESKD) by haemodialysis: tunnelled catheters placed in a central vein (central venous lines, CVLs), arteriovenous fistulas (AVF), and arteriovenous grafts (AVG) using prosthetic or biological material. Compared with the adult literature, there are few studies in children to provide evidence based guidelines for optimal vascular access type or its management and outcomes in children with ESKD.The European Society for Paediatric Nephrology Dialysis Working Group (ESPN Dialysis WG) have developed recommendations for the choice of access type, pre-operative evaluation, monitoring, and prevention and management of complications of different access types in children with ESKD.For adults with ESKD on haemodialysis, the principle of \"Fistula First\" has been key to changing the attitude to vascular access for haemodialysis. However, data from multiple observational studies and the International Paediatric Haemodialysis Network registry suggest that CVLs are associated with a significantly higher rate of infections and access dysfunction, and need for access replacement. Despite this, AVFs are used in only \u223c25% of children on haemodialysis. It is important to provide the right access for the right patient at the right time in their life-course of renal replacement therapy, with an emphasis on venous preservation at all times. While AVFs may not be suitable in the very young or those with an anticipated short dialysis course before transplantation, many paediatric studies have shown that AVFs are superior to CVLs.Here we present clinical practice recommendations for AVFs and CVLs in children with ESKD. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system has been used to develop and GRADE the recommendations. In the absence of high quality evidence, the opinion of experts from the ESPN Dialysis WG is provided, but is clearly GRADE-ed as such and must be carefully considered by the treating physician, and adapted to local expertise and individual patient needs as appropriate."

With the exception of restless legs and skin changes, there was no statistically significant change in symptom severity or EQ-5D-5L with increasing time from the long interdialytic interval. Patients who responded on non-HD days had higher severity of poor appetite, constipation, difficulty sleeping, poor mobility and depression (approximately 0.2 severity level), and lower EQ-5D-5L (-0.06, CI -0.09 to -0.03) compared to HD days.Measuring symptom severity and EQ-5D-5L in haemodialysis populations does not need to account for dialysis schedule, but completion either on HD or non-HD days could introduce bias that may impact evaluation of interventions. Researchers should ensure completion of these instruments are standardized on either dialysis or non-dialysis days."

This study aimed to compare infectious and mechanical complications related to urgent-start PD and HD. Secondary outcomes were to identify risk factors for complications and mortality related to urgent-start dialysis.A quasi-experimental study with incident patients receiving PD and HD in a Brazilian university hospital, between July 2014 and December 2017. Subjects included individuals with final-stage chronic kidney disease who required immediate RRT, that is, HD through central venous catheter or PD in which the catheter was implanted by a nephrologist and utilized for 72 h, without previous training. Patients with PD were subjected, initially, to high-volume PD for metabolic compensation. After hospital discharge, they remained in intermittent PD in the dialysis unit until training was completed. Mechanical and infectious complications were compared, as well as the recovery of renal function and survival.In total, 93 patients were included in PD and 91 in HD. PD and HD groups were similar regarding age (58\u2009\u00b1\u200917 vs. 60\u2009\u00b1\u200915 years; <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.49), frequency of diabetes mellitus (37.6% vs. 50.5%; <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.10), other comorbidities (74.1% vs. 71.4%; <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.67) and biochemical parameters at the beginning of RRT, that is, creatinine (9.1\u2009\u00b1\u20094.1 vs. 8.0\u2009\u00b1\u20092.8; <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.09), serum albumin (3.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6 vs. 3.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6; <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.06) and haemoglobin (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 vs. 9.8 \u00b1 2.0; <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.44).

There was better phosphorus control at 180 days in the PD group (62.4% vs. 41.8%; <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.008), with a lower requirement for phosphate binder usage (28% vs. 55%; <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001), erythropoietin (18.3% vs. 49.5%; <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001) and anti-hypertensives (11.8% vs. 30.8%; <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.003). Time to death was similar between groups. In the multivariate analysis, PD was a predictor of renal function recovery [odds ratio: 3.95 (1.01-15.4)].PD is a viable and safe alternative to HD in a scenario of urgent-start RRT with complication rates and outcomes similar to those of HD, highlighting the results regarding renal function recovery."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Thrice-weekly haemodialysis is the usual dose when starting renal replacement therapy; however, this schedule is no longer appropriate since it does not consider residual renal function. Several reports have suggested the potential benefit of beginning haemodialysis less frequently and incrementally increasing the dose as the residual renal function decreases. However, all the data published so far are from observational studies. Thus, this clinical trial avoids any potential selection bias and will assess the possible benefits that have been observed in observational studies.This report describes the study protocol of a randomized prospective multi-centre open-label clinical trial to evaluate whether starting renal replacement therapy with twice-weekly haemodialysis sessions preserves residual renal function better than the standard thrice-weekly regimen. We also explore other clinical parameters, such as concentrations of uremic toxins, dialysis doses, control of anaemia, removal of medium-weight uremic toxins, nutritional status, quality of life, hospital admissions and mortality. Only incident haemodialysis patients who can maintain a urea clearance rate KrU \u2265 2.5\u2009mL/min/1.73\u2009m<sup>2</sup> are eligible. Patient recruitment began on 1 January 2017 and will last for 2 years or until the required sample size has been recruited to ensure the established statistical power has been reached. The minimum follow-up period will be 1 year. Anuric patients with acute renal failure and patients who return to haemodialysis after a kidney transplant failure are excluded. It has been calculated that 44 patients should be recruited into each group to achieve a power of 80% in a two-sided comparison of means with a usual significance level of 0.05. A time-to-event analysis will estimate the probability of kidney function survival in both groups using the Kaplan-Meier method. Survival curves will be compared with log-rank tests. This survival analysis will be complemented with a proportional hazard model to estimate the hazard ratio of kidney function survival adjusted for any confounding factors. Analyses will be carried out in accordance with the intention-to-treat principle.The incremental initiation of dialysis may preserve residual renal function better than the conventional treatment, with similar or higher survival rates, as reported by observational studies. To our knowledge, this is the first clinical trial to evaluate whether initiating renal replacement therapy with twice-weekly haemodialysis sessions preserves residual renal function better than beginning with the standard thrice-weekly regimen.ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03302546.

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Although the clearance of low-molecular weight toxins is modulated by dialysis dose, the relationship between dialysis adequacy and middle systemic inflammatory mediators is often overlooked. Thus, the relationship between dialysis adequacy, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in hemodialysis (HD) patients was investigated. Forty-eight HD patients (19 women and 25 men) were investigated. Age, body mass index, time in HD, nutritional status, Kt/V and blood biochemical parameters was similar in patients of both sexes (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Thus, patients were stratified by dialysis adequacy measured by Kt/V method (adequate Kt/V\u00a0\u2265\u00a01.2). Post-HD urea, creatinine, cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, IL-4 and IL-10) and chemokines (CCL-2, CCL-5, CXCL-8 and CXCL-10) were higher in patients with Kt/V\u00a0<\u00a01.2 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Kt/V exhibited significant correlation with CXCL-10/IP-10 serum levels. Positive correlation between creatinine with IFN-\u03b3, CCL-2/MCP-1, and CXCL-10/IP-10, and negative correlation with IL-10 was identified in patients with Kt/V\u00a0<\u00a01.2 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In patients with Kt/V\u00a0\u2265\u00a01.2, only IL-10 was positively and CXCL-10/IP-10 negatively correlated with creatinine levels (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Kt/V and creatinine levels exhibited variable predictive value (Kt/V\u00a0=\u00a027% to 37%, creatinine\u00a0=\u00a029% to 47%) to explain cytokines and chemokines circulating levels in patients with adequate and inadequate dialysis dose. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that in addition to modulating uremic toxins levels, such as urea and creatinine, dialysis dose is associated with circulating levels of inflammatory mediators. Thus, low Kt/V results and creatinine accumulation are potential indicators of the systemic inflammatory stress determined by up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and downregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines."

Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method was used to detect the serum level of HMGB1, interleukin (IL-6), IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1). The kidney disease quality of life short form (KDQOL-SF) and kidney disease targeted area (KDTA) was applied for evaluating the quality of life. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curve was performed for survival time.Serum level of HMGB1 in patients on HD was higher than PD. HMGB1 levels were gradually decreased with the treatment of HD or PD. Furthermore, HMGB1 was positively correlated with IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1. Moreover, patients with higher HMGB1 had more complications than patients with lower HMGB1, but there was no difference for the survival rate. In addition, the quality of life was associated with different dialysis methods.The serum level of HMGB1 and prognosis of ESRD patients was associated with different dialysis methods."

    "content": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasingly recognised as an important cause of morbidity and mortality in South Africa (SA). Although the cost of dialysis is well documented in developed countries, little is known about this cost in sub-Saharan Africa.To review the costs of providing peritoneal dialysis (PD) and haemodialysis (HD) at the Pietersburg renal dialysis public-private partnership (PPP) unit in Limpopo Province, SA.A retrospective review of the cost of inputs required for HD and PD was conducted from a provider's perspective, covering the period 2007 - 2012. A top-down approach was used to estimate the average annual cost per patient on HD and PD.During the 6-year period under review, the number of patients on dialysis increased from 77 in 2007 to 182 in 2012. More than 60% of the patients were on HD. The average annual cost per patient was estimated to be ZAR212 286 (USD25 888) and ZAR255 076 (USD31\u00a0106) for HD and PD, respectively, in 2012. Personnel cost, PD supplies, HD supplies, the outsourcing fee and pharmaceutical supplies were the main cost drivers. PD proved to be more expensive than HD, despite the use of locally manufactured fluids.The study highlights the exceptionally high cost of dialysis treatment. Dialysis should be made more accessible by implementing measures to address the main cost drivers. Moreover, a comprehensive approach that includes prevention of CKD at primary healthcare level, an organ donation programme and an effective kidney transplant programme is urgently required in Limpopo. Further research is required to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the PPP approach."

Renal nurses are historically trained on the technical aspects of acute haemodialysis and can provide a level of psychological support to patients. However, they have not been trained to manage patients with severe mental illness.To explore renal nurses' experiences of nursing patients with severe mental illness receiving acute haemodialysis, and to identify factors that facilitate or hinder the nursing care of these patients.A descriptive qualitative study.Purposive sampling was employed, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 renal nurses working in an acute haemodialysis unit. Thematic analysis was utilised to analyse the data.Thematic analysis identified four main themes which are perspectives of mental Illness, patient and staff safety concerns, facilitators of care and education and support needs.Renal nurses experienced difficulty managing challenging behaviours manifested by patients with severe mental illness. Despite the various challenges, renal nurses adopted a person-centred approach. Staff shortages and lack of training were significant hindrances to care delivery. Education on mental health conditions, support from senior staff and collaborative working can enable confidence and increase renal nurses' knowledge and experience in mental health care."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "The survival rate for dialysis patients is poor. Previous studies have shown improved survival with home hemodialysis (HHD), but this could be due to patient selection, since HHD patients tend to be younger and healthier. The aim of the present study is to analyse the long-term effects of HHD on patient survival and on subsequent renal transplantation, compared with institutional hemodialysis (IHD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD), taking age and comorbidity into account.Patients starting HHD as initial renal replacement therapy (RRT) were matched with patients on IHD or PD, according to gender, age, Charlson Comorbidity Index and start date of RRT, using the Swedish Renal Registry from 1991 to 2012. Survival analyses were performed as intention-to-treat (disregarding changes in RRT) and per-protocol (as on initial RRT).A total of 152 patients with HHD as initial RRT were matched with 608 IHD and 456 PD patients, respectively. Median survival was longer for HHD in intention-to-treat analyses: 18.5\u2009years compared with 11.9 for IHD (p\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.001) and 15.0 for PD (p\u2009=\u20090.002). The difference remained significant in per-protocol analyses omitting the contribution of subsequent transplantation. Patients on HHD were more likely to receive a renal transplant compared with IHD and PD, although treatment modality did not affect subsequent graft survival (p\u2009>\u20090.05).HHD as initial RRT showed improved long-term patient survival compared with IHD and PD. This survival advantage persisted after matching and adjusting for a higher transplantation rate. Dialysis modality had no impact on subsequent graft survival."

This study aimed to identify the factors associated with QoL in patients with ESRD undergoing dialysis at a national hospital in Vietnam.A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among outpatients aged \u226518\u00a0years who underwent haemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) for at least 3\u00a0months at Thong Nhat Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam from May 2020 to July 2021. QoL was measured using the validated Vietnamese version of the EuroQol-5 Dimensional-5 Level (EQ-5D-5L). The factors associated with the QoL of patients with ESRD undergoing dialysis were identified using multiple linear regression analysis.In total, 131 (73.6%) and 47 (26.4%) patients underwent HD and PD, respectively. Overall, 178 (55.6%) patients were men (median age, 66 [56-79] years). The mean EQ-5D-5L score was significantly higher in patients undergoing PD than in those undergoing HD (0.848\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.183 vs. 0.766\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.231; p\u00a0=\u00a00.030).

The current study aims to describe and compare ESRD patients' QOL according to dialysis modalities (hemodialysis [HD] and peritoneal dialysis [PD]).This is a cross-sectional study, conducted in dialysis facilities of a Moroccan university hospital, during October 2018. All adult ESRD patients, treated either by HD or PD for more than 3\u2009months and agreeing to participate, were included. Medical data were collected using a questionnaire, whereas the QOL data were collected using the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form (KDQOL SF v 1.3) scale previously validated in dialectal Arabic. The patients' characteristics and QOL data were compared between dialysis modalities (HD vs. PD), using a linear regression, before and after adjustment on several demographic and medical factors as well as a propensity score created to reduce the effect of confounding factors related to the choice of the treatment.Out of the 91 included patients (50.5% of men, median age 52.0 (IQR [36.5; 62.0]) years), 71 were on HD and 20 were on PD. The highest subscale score, for all participants, was the social support's one with a median of 83.3 (IQR [66.7; 100]), and the lowest one was the kidney disease burden with a median of 25.0 (IQR [0.00; 46.9]). The univariate analysis showed that the Physical Component Score (PCS), the cognitive function, and the dialysis staff encouragement were better in PD patients (p\u2009=\u20090.03, p\u2009=\u20090.04, and p\u2009=\u20090.007, respectively), while the multiple linear regression indicates that the PCS, the dialysis Staff encouragement, and the patient's satisfaction subscores decreased within patients on HD compared with those on PD (p\u2009=\u20090.01, p\u2009=\u20090.03, and p\u2009=\u20090.02, respectively) and that the burden of the kidney disease and the work status subscores increased within patients on HD against those on PD (p\u2009=\u20090.007 and p\u2009=\u20090.04, respectively).This study showed a significant difference between dialysis modalities in some sides of quality of life."

We therefore conducted this meta-analysis to examine the RRF protective effect of different dialysis types for hemodialysis patients.A systematic search was performed on PubMed, EMbase, Web of Science, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Wanfang database, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure for randomized controlled trials and cohort studies. Dialysis types included low-flux hemodialysis (LFHD), high-flux hemodialysis (HFHD), hemodiafiltration (HDF), and hemodialysis and hemoperfusion (HD+HP). The mean of endogenous creatinine clearance rate (CCR) and urea clearance rate (Curea), or urine volume was used to estimate RRF [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 6.05-16.80].There were 12 articles involving 1224 patients, including 11 random controlled trials and 1 cohort study. Meta-analysis showed that the RRF protective effect of HFHD [mean difference (MD)\u200a=\u200a1.48, 95% CI (2.11 to 0.86), P\u200a<\u200a.01] and HD+HP [MD\u200a=\u200a0.41, 95% CI (0.69 to 0.12), P\u200a=\u200a.005] was better than that of LFHD, and the RRF decline rate was the lowest in HFHD group [MD\u200a=\u200a0.13, 95% CI (0.17 to 0.09), P\u200a<\u200a.01]. Descriptive analysis showed that HDF could better protect RRF when compared with LFHD. However, there was no consistency among other interventions when removing LFHD due to limited data.For patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis, the HFHD, HD+HP and HDF may better protect RRF, compared with LFHD."

    "content": "More than a third of the 65,000 people living with kidney failure in the UK attend a dialysis unit 2-5 times a week to have their blood cleaned for 3-5 h. In haemodialysis (HD), toxins are removed by diffusion, which can be enhanced using a high-flux dialyser. This can be augmented with convection, as occurs in haemodiafiltration (HDF), and improved outcomes have been reported in people who are able to achieve high volumes of convection. This study compares the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of high-volume HDF compared with high-flux HD in the treatment of kidney failure.This is a UK-based, multi-centre, non-blinded randomised controlled trial. Adult patients already receiving HD or HDF will be randomised 1:1 to high-volume HDF (aiming for 21+ L of substitution fluid adjusted for body surface area) or high-flux HD. Exclusion criteria include lack of capacity to consent, life expectancy less than 3 months, on HD/HDF for less than 4 weeks, planned living kidney donor transplant or home dialysis scheduled within 3 months, prior intolerance of HDF and not suitable for high-volume HDF for other clinical reasons. The primary outcome is a composite of non-cancer mortality or hospital admission with a cardiovascular event or infection during follow-up (minimum 32 months, maximum 91 months) determined from routine data. Secondary outcomes include all-cause mortality, cardiovascular- and infection-related morbidity and mortality, health-related quality of life, cost-effectiveness and environmental impact. Baseline data will be collected by research personnel on-site. Follow-up data will be collected by linkage to routine healthcare databases - Hospital Episode Statistics, Civil Registration, Public Health England and the UK Renal Registry (UKRR) in England, and equivalent databases in Scotland and Wales, as necessary - and centrally administered patient-completed questionnaires. In addition, research personnel on-site will monitor for adverse events and collect data on adherence to the protocol (monthly during recruitment and quarterly during follow-up).This study will provide evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of HD as compared to HDF for adults with kidney failure in-centre HD or HDF. It will inform management for this patient group in the UK and internationally.ISRCTN10997319 . Registered on 10 October 2017."

Similarly, there is a dearth of information on the relationship between gut microbiota and ESRD prognoses. We collected fecal samples and tracked clinical outcomes from 73 ESRD patients, including 33 pre-dialysis ESRD patients, 19 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, and 21 hemodialysis (HD) patients. 16S rRNA sequencing and bioinformatics tools were used to analyze the gut microbiota of ESRD patients and healthy controls. Gut microbiota diversity was different before and after dialysis. Bacteroidetes were significantly deceased in HD patients. Twelve bacterial genera exhibited statistically significant differences, due to dialysis (all <i>P</i> < 0.05, FDR corrected). HD reversed abnormal changes in <i>Oscillospira</i> and <i>SMB53</i> in pre-dialysis patients. Functional predictions of microbial communities showed that PD and HD altered signal transduction and metabolic pathways in ESRD patients. Furthermore, <i>Bacteroides</i> and <i>Phascolarctobacterium</i> were associated with cardiovascular mortality. <i>Dorea</i>, <i>Clostridium</i>, and <i>SMB53</i> were related to peritonitis in PD patients. This study not only demonstrated differences in gut microbiota between pre-dialysis and dialysis ESRD patients, but also firstly proposed gut bacteria may exert an impact on patient prognosis."

    "content": "Plant phenols may accumulate in end-stage kidney disease. The effect of hemodialysis on their plasma concentration remains poorly determined. Contingent on concentration, health-promoting or noxious effects occur; therefore, we assessed plasma concentration in hemodialyzed patients. In total, 21 maintenance hemodialyzed patients with diuresis < 500 mL per day (with oliguria), nine hemodialyzed patients with diuresis \u2265 500 mL per day (without oliguria) and 31 healthy volunteers were included. Nine phenolic acids were identified with high-performance liquid chromatography and total polyphenol concentration was determined with the Folin-Ciocalteu method in pre- or post-hemodialysis plasma and pre- or intra-hemodialysis dialysate. The concentration of total polyphenols was 27% higher in pre-hemodialysis plasma than in that of controls (0.95 \u00b1 0.18 mmol/L [P < 0.0001]). The concentration of total polyphenols was higher in patients with oliguria (1.01 \u00b1 0.17) than in those without (0.84 \u00b1 0.13 mmol/L), despite the former having more intense hemodialysis (Kt/V 1.29 \u00b1 0.31 and 0.77 \u00b1 0.25, respectively). Pre-hemodialysis phenolic acid concentration in patients undergoing dialysis exceeded reference values by 3 to 34 times (3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and vanillic acid, respectively), from 0.69 (dihydrocaffeic acid) to 169.3 \u03bcmol/L (hippuric acid). The concentration of six phenolic acids (3-hydroxyhippuric, caffeic, dihydrocaffeic, hippuric, homovanillic, and vanillic acid) was 1.1 (homovanillic) to 11.3 (3-hydroxyhippuric) times higher in patients with oliguria than in those without. 4-hydroxyhippuric acid occurred more in the plasma of patients with oliguria than in those without oliguria. A single hemodialysis session decreased total polyphenol concentration by 16% and phenolic acids from 30% (caffeic) to 58% (vanillic and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) and these compounds appeared in the dialysate. The percentage decrease (\u0394%) of creatinine concentration correlated with the \u0394% of total polyphenols and five phenolic acids (3-hydroxyphenylacetic, dihydrocaffeic, hippuric, homovanillic, and vanillic acid). Urea \u0394% and Kt/V correlated only with the \u0394% of homovanilic acid. The results demonstrate that phenols accumulate variably in hemodialyzed patients and are differently eliminated during hemodialysis. Residual renal function ensures a lower concentration of plasma phenols."

More frequent haemodialysis 5-6 days/week in randomized clinical trials has shown benefits for controlling volume overload, blood pressure and phosphorus, reducing left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and improving patient tolerance to therapy. Therapy prescriptions were guided by volume of urea cleared, time-integrated fluid loading control and increased phosphate-\u03b22 microglobulin removal, with greater treatment frequency to address clinical efficacy targets. Case studies in all three categories show that treatment with more frequent haemodialysis in low-dialysate flow systems (Qd <200 mL/min, dialysate of 25-30 L/session, 5-7 days/week for 2.5-3.0 h/session) improves control of heart failure. In pregnancy, treatment 7 days/week with 30 L and 3 h/session of dialysis enabled successful delivery of infants at 32-34 weeks, with all doing well 2-5 years after birth. Obese patients with a body mass index (BMI) >35 achieved control of volume, blood pressure and uraemic symptoms compared to their prior 3 times/week in-centre haemodialysis. Greater application of more frequent haemodialysis should be considered, particularly in high-risk populations, to improve clinical care."

The HD group (48/926 BAU/ml) had a diminished antibody level compared to PD (93/1,607 BAU/ml). Moreover, the seroconversion rate after the 1st dose was lower in HD than PD (56% vs. 86%). KTRs had extremely low seroconversion (33%). IgA-mediated immunity was the most effective in the control group, while other patients had diminished IgA production. We observed a lower percentage of vaccine responders based on the IFN-\u03b3 level in all research participants (100% vs. 85% in control, 100% vs. 80% in PD, 97% vs. 64% in HD). 63% of seropositive KTRs had a positive IGRA, while 28% of seronegative patients produced IFN-\u03b3. Collectively, PD patients had the strongest response among ESRD patients. Two doses of the Pfizer vaccine are ineffective, especially in HD and KTRs. A closer investigation of ESRD and KTRs is required to set the COVID-19 vaccine clinical guidance.www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT04 905 862."

    "title": "Hepatitis B Vaccination Response in Hemodialysis Patients: The Impact of Dialysis Shift.",
    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Hepatitis B (HB) vaccination in hemodialysis patients is important as they are at a higher risk of contracting HB. However, hemodialysis patients have a lower HB seroconversion rate than their healthy counterparts. As better sleep has been associated with better seroconversion in healthy populations and early hemodialysis start has been linked to significant sleep-wake disturbances in hemodialysis patients, we examined if hemodialysis treatment start time is associated with HB vaccination response.Demographics, standard-of-care clinical, laboratory, and treatment parameters, dialysis shift data, HB antigen status, HB vaccination status, and HB titers were collected from hemodialysis patients in Fresenius clinics from January 2010 to December 2015. Patients in our analysis received 90% of dialysis treatments either before or after 8:30 a.m., were negative for HB antigen, and received a complete series of HB vaccination (Engerix B\u00ae or Recombivax HB\u2122). Univariate and multivariate regression models examined whether dialysis start time is a predictor of HB vaccination response.Patients were 65 years old, 57% male, and had a HD vintage of 10 months. Patients whose dialysis treatments started before 8:30 a.m. were more likely to be younger, male, and have a greater dialysis vintage. Patients receiving Engerix B\u00ae and starting dialysis before 8:30 a.m. had a significantly higher seroconversion rate compared to patients who started dialysis after 8:30 a.m. Early dialysis start was a significant predictor of seroconversion in univariate and multivariate regression including male gender, but not in multivariate regression including age, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and vintage.While better sleep following vaccination is associated with seroconversion in the general population, this is not the case in hemodialysis patients after multivariate adjustment. In the context of end-stage kidney disease, early dialysis start is not a significant predictor of HB vaccination response. The association between objectively measured postvaccination sleep duration and seroconversion rate should be investigated."

    "content": "There is no national consensus on infection control in haemodialysis units in Australia and New Zealand. The primary aim of this guideline was to provide recommendations on screening for blood-borne viruses and multi-resistant organisms for dialysis units based on the available evidence.The Kidney Health Australia Caring for Australasians with Renal Impairment guidelines, overall approach to guideline development follows the GRADE framework. A facilitated workshop was conducted to ensure that patient and caregiver concerns were considered. The evidence from relevant medical databases on the impact of screening on detection and transmission rates, hospitalization, mortality and psychosocial care, was reviewed and critically appraised. The guideline group made recommendations from the evidence available.The main guideline recommendations are: Dialysis units adopt a comprehensive approach that encompasses standard infection control precautions. Conduct routine surveillance for key blood-borne viruses and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Conduct routine surveillance of individual levels of protection against hepatitis B for patients on haemodialysis. Use dedicated dialysis machines for HBV-infected patients. The evidence in totality was not found to support routine surveillance of vancomycin-resistant Enterococci . Enhanced surveillance in light of the local risk of transmittable infectious agents should be considered by dialysis units. Very few studies have reported on the potential adverse effects of screening and associated practices.Future research should focus on the potential benefits and adverse effects of screening and associated practices on clinical outcomes including infections prevented and health service delivery, and psychosocial domains for patients. Given the results of trials in the critical setting, the effectiveness of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus decolonization in people receiving dialysis therapy warrants further research."

    "content": "In the emergency admission due to worsening heart failure (HF) in patients on maintenance hemodialysis, emergent dialysis may be indicated, which increases personnel expenses. To clarify the characteristics and in-hospital management of the patients, we conducted a multicenter retrospective study including 142 patients on maintenance hemodialysis emergently admitted for worsening HF (71.6\u2009\u00b1\u20099.2\u2009years, 69.0% male, 44.4% HF with preserved [\u226550%] ejection fraction). The interval between last hemodialysis and admission was long (median 55\u2009h), suggesting that fluid accumulation triggered HF events. Although most patients (73.9%) were admitted in the nighttime (5\u2009p.m. to 9\u2009a.m.), only 17.9% of them needed nighttime dialysis and were managed medically until the first in-hospital dialysis, with the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in 45.1% and oxygen supplementation in 95.8%. While patients on hemodialysis with worsening HF were frequently admitted in the nighttime, nighttime dialysis was indicated in a limited population."

    "content": "Various factors can affect blood and tissue levels of trace elements in patients with end-stage renal disease. There are a few studies showing hyperintensity of basal ganglia associated with manganese deposition in hemodialysis (HD) patients. The present study aimed to investigate the intensity changes as markers of manganese deposition in the basal ganglia and to demonstrate their association with blood manganese levels using ICP/MS technique in HD, peritoneal dialysis (PD), and renal transplant patients.The study included 20 HD, 20 PD, 20 renal transplant patients, and 20 healthy controls. Blood manganese levels were obtained, and cranial magnetic resonance images were evaluated for basal ganglia hyperintensity.Blood manganese levels were similar across all study groups (p\u00a0=\u00a00.308), whereas symmetric basal ganglia hyperintensity indicating manganese deposition was detected only in HD patients (p\u00a0=\u00a0<\u00a00.001). There was a significant relationship between manganese deposition and duration of dialysis (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05).Imaging findings suggesting manganese deposition in the basal ganglia being present only in HD patients suggest that manganese deposition could be caused by the hemodialysis method itself rather than uremia and renal failure. Further studies are required in this regard, as previous studies have not clearly identified the mechanisms by which hemodialysis causes these changes."

    "content": "Extended-hours haemodialysis has long been regarded as the optimal form of dialysis for solute clearance. With emerging benefits of haemodiafiltration, we wanted to compare these two head-to-head.In this randomized cross-over trial, we recruited existing nocturnal haemodialysis patients, who had not been hospitalized in the prior 3\u2009months. After a baseline 8 h haemodialysis session, subjects were randomized to either 2\u2009weeks of 8 h haemodialysis or 4 h haemodiafiltration with cross-over to the alternative treatment after a 2-week washout period. Subjects were additionally randomized to the Fresenius FX80 or Nipro Elisio in a parallel design. Blood and dialysate samples were collected at baseline and at the end of both study periods.Twelve patients completed the study. Mean (SD) age and body mass index were 55.1\u2009\u00b1\u200911.5\u2009years and 36.4\u2009\u00b1\u200910.8, respectively.

No difference was seen in reduction ratios for phosphate, retinol binding protein, alpha-1-microglobulin, beta-2-microglobulin and fetuin with both modalities.

Beta-2-microglobulin clearance was improved with Fresenius FX80 dialyser, but this difference is unlikely to be clinically significant."

    "content": "End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are at a substantially higher risk for developing cognitive impairment compared with the healthy population. Dialysis is an essential way to maintain the life of ESRD patients. Based on previous research, there isn't an uncontested result whether cognition was improved or worsened during dialysis.To explore the impact of dialysis treatment on cognitive performance, we recruited healthy controls (HCs), predialysis ESRD patients (predialysis group), and maintenance hemodialysis ESRD patients (HD group). All ESRD patients performed six blood biochemistry tests (hemoglobin, urea, cystatin C, Na+, K+, and parathyroid hormone). Neuropsychological tests were used to measure cognitive function. By using diffusion tensor imaging and graph-theory approaches, the topological organization of the whole-brain structural network was investigated. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were performed to investigate blood biochemistry predictors of the neuropsychological tests and the results of graph analyses in the HD group and predialysis group.Neuropsychological analysis showed the HD group exhibited better cognitive function than the predialysis group, but both were worse than HCs. Whole-brain graph analyses revealed that increased global efficiency and normalized shortest path length remained in the predialysis group and HD group than the HCs. Besides, a lower normalized clustering coefficient was found in the predialysis group relative to the HCs and HD group. For the GLM analysis, only the Cystatin C level was significantly associated with the average fiber length of rich club connections in the predialysis group.Our study revealed that dialysis had a limited effect on cognitive improvement."

Chronic itch (CI) has been reported to be a poor prognostic marker for patients on HD; however, this has not been investigated in a representative patient cohort. In 2017, all HD patients were contacted again to investigate mortality in those with and without CI and to identify its determinants. Patients' characteristics, study instruments and CI were assessed, as in 2013. The response rate was 84.2% (n\u2009=\u2009724). One-year mortality was 15.3%. Mortality was significantly higher in those with secondary scratch lesions compared with those with non-affected skin. This was also true after controlling for age and sex in a multivariate model. This study demonstrates a high mortality in HD patients; however, mortality depends on itch intensity, not on the occurrence of CI itself."

Studies comparing hospitalisations between peritoneal dialysis (PD) and haemodialysis (HD) report conflicting results and mostly analyse data of patients that remain on their initial dialysis modality. This cohort study compares hospitalisations between PD and HD patients taking into account transitions between modalities.The Dutch nOcturnal and hoME dialysis Study To Improve Clinical Outcomes collected hospitalisation data of patients who started dialysis between 2012 and 2017. Primary outcome was hospitalisation rate, analysed with a multi-state model that attributed each hospitalisation to the current dialysis modality.In total, 695 patients (252 PD, 443 HD) treated in 31 Dutch hospitals were included. The crude hospitalisation rate for PD was 2.3 (\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.0) and for HD 1.4 (\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2) hospitalisations per patient-year. The adjusted hazard ratio for hospitalisation rate was 1.1 (95%CI 1.02-1.3) for PD compared with HD. The risk for first hospitalisation was 1.3 times (95%CI 1.1-1.6) higher for PD compared with HD during the first year after dialysis initiation. The number of hospitalisations and number of hospital days per patient-year were significantly higher for PD. The most common causes of PD and HD hospitalisations were peritonitis (23%) and vascular access-related problems (33%).PD was associated with higher hospitalisation rate, higher risk for first hospitalisation and higher number of hospitalisations compared with HD. Since the PD hospitalisations were mainly caused by peritonitis, more attention to infection prevention is necessary for reducing the number of hospitalisations in the future."

This study compared the survival between incident hemodialysis (HD) and PD patients, with and without diabetes, in the era of icodextrin treatment.From the Taiwan health insurance database, 53,103 incident end-stage renal disease patients undergoing dialysis were identified from 2005 to 2010. The mortality risks among HD and PD patients with or without icodextrin treatment were compared. The follow-up period started from the date of dialysis initiation to December 31, 2011. The competing-risks regression model was used to estimate the subhazard ratio (SHR) of death with considering renal transplantation as a competing event.Compared with the corresponding HD patients, mortality risks were higher in diabetic PD patients with icodextrin treatment (Bonferroni adjusted SHR=1.16, 98.3% CI=1.04-1.30) and without the treatment (Bonferroni adjusted SHR=1.35, 98.3% CI=1.16-1.57), particularly for elderly patients. Mortality risks for patients without diabetes were not different among the three cohorts. The time-dependent competing-risks model showed that PD patients with icodextrin treatment exhibited a reduced risk of death for diabetic patients, compared with those without icodextrin treatment (adjusted SHR=0.84, 95% CI=0.72-0.97).Icodextrin could attenuate the survival disadvantage for PD relative to HD in diabetic patients, particularly for the elderly patients."

We aimed to compare the effects of hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis (PD) and renal transplantation (RT) on micronutrient levels and nutritional status in ESRD patients.A total of 77 ESRD patients who had not received RRT were included in this prospective longitudinal study. All ESRD patients underwent a blood serum analysis that assessed the micronutrients such as selenium, copper, zinc, chromium, retinol, thiamine and vitamin B6 as well as a nutritional status assessment. After the baseline assessments and the initiation of RRT was accomplished, all patients were followed for 6 months.The study showed significant improvements in subjective global assessment scores (percentage increases in score A were 26.6 and 36.6; p\u202f=\u202f0.039 and p\u202f=\u202f0.001; respectively), mid-arm circumference and the skin-fold thicknesses (p\u202f<\u202f0.001, p\u202f<\u202f0.001; respectively) in the RT and hemodialysis groups. The examinations at sixth month revealed a significant increase in body weight (4.8\u202fkg; p\u202f=\u202f0.002) and albumin levels (0.6\u202fg/dL; p\u202f<\u202f0.001) in only RT group. Zinc, thiamin and vitamin B6 were the most deficient micronutrients (44.1 %, 24.7 % and 35.1 %; respectively) in ESRD patients. There was a significant increase in selenium and retinol levels (p\u202f=\u202f0.020 and p\u202f<\u202f0.001; respectively) but a significant decrease in thiamin levels (p\u202f=\u202f0.041) in RT patients. A significant increase in retinol levels (p\u202f=\u202f0.028) and a significant decrease in thiamin levels (p\u202f=\u202f0.022) was observed in the hemodialysis patients. However, no significant change in micronutrient levels was observed in the PD patients.The results support the recommendation that ESRD patients should be supplemented with water-soluble vitamins, especially thiamine and vitamin B6, and trace elements, especially zinc. RT appears to be superior to other modes of RRT when examining SGA score, anthropometric measurements, albumin and micronutrient levels."

Statistical analyses revealed lefamulin and BC-8041 pharmacokinetics were similar between Normal and Severe groups, except for renal clearance, which decreased in Severe subjects (mean 1.3 L/h Normal vs. 0.4 L/h Severe). Likewise, lefamulin pharmacokinetics during on and off dialysis were unchanged, with lefamulin not measurably filtered in dialysate fluid. Two, three, and three subjects reported drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) in Normal, Severe, and Hemodialysis groups, respectively. All TEAEs were mild, except one (infusion-site reaction) that was classified as moderate.No dosage adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment, and lefamulin can be administered without regard to hemodialysis timing."

We aimed to identify reasons for transfer to HD, hybrid dialysis and hospitalisation in the Japan Peritoneal Dialysis and Outcomes Practice Patterns Study.This observational study included 808 adult PD patients across 31 facilities in Japan in 2014-2017. Information on all-cause and cause-specific mortality and hospitalisation and permanent transfer to HD and PD/HD hybrid therapy were prospectively collected and rates calculated.Median follow-up time was 1.66 years where 162 patients transferred to HD, 79 transferred to hybrid dialysis and 74 patients died. All-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related mortality rates were 5.1 and 1.7 deaths/100 patient-years, respectively. Rates of transfer to HD and hybrid therapy were 11.2 and 5.5 transfers/100 patient-years, respectively. Among HD transfers, 40% were due to infection (including peritonitis), while 20% were due to inadequate solute/water clearance. Eighty-one percent of hybrid dialysis transfers were due to inadequate solute/water clearance. All--cause, peritonitis-related and CVD-related hospitalisation rates were 120.4, 21.1 and 15.6/100 patient-years, respectively. Median hospital length of stay was 19 days.Mortality, hospitalisation and transfer to HD/hybrid dialysis rates are relatively low in Japan compared to many other countries with hybrid transfers, accounting for one-third of dialysis transfers from PD. Further study is needed to explain the high inter-facility variation in hospitalisation rates and how to further reduce hospitalisation rates for Japanese PD patients."

However, until now there is just one study in the USA on the prevalence of hypertension in haemodialysis patients by 44-h recordings. Since there is a knowledge gap on the problem in European countries, we reassessed the problem in the European Cardiovascular and Renal Medicine working group Registry of the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association.A total of 396 haemodialysis patients underwent 48-h ABP monitoring during a regular haemodialysis session and the subsequent interdialytic interval. Hypertension was defined as (i) pre-haemodialysis blood pressure (BP)\u2009\u2265140/90\u2009mmHg or use of antihypertensive agents and (ii) ABP\u2009\u2265130/80\u2009mmHg or use of antihypertensive agents.The prevalence of hypertension by 48-h ABP monitoring was very high (84.3%) and close to that by pre-haemodialysis BP (89.4%) but the agreement of the two techniques was not of the same magnitude (\u03ba statistics\u2009=\u20090.648; P\u2009<0.001). In all, 290 participants were receiving antihypertensive treatment. In all, 9.1% of haemodialysis patients were categorized as normotensives, 12.6% had controlled hypertension confirmed by the two BP techniques, while 46.0% had uncontrolled hypertension with both techniques. The prevalence of white coat hypertension was 18.2% and that of masked hypertension 14.1%. Of note, hypertension was confined only to night-time in 22.2% of patients while just 1% of patients had only daytime hypertension. Pre-dialysis BP\u2009\u2265140/90\u2009mmHg had 76% sensitivity and 54% specificity for the diagnosis of BP\u2009\u2265130/80\u2009mmHg by 48-h ABP monitoring.The prevalence of hypertension in haemodialysis patients assessed by 48-h ABP monitoring is very high. Pre-haemodialysis BP poorly reflects the 48\u2009h-ABP burden. About a third of the haemodialysis population has white coat or masked hypertension. These findings add weight to consensus documents supporting the use of ABP monitoring for proper hypertension diagnosis and treatment in this population."

Mortality was significantly worse in Group A if dialysis vintage was \u22646\u2009months and from 12-24\u2009months (P\u2009<\u20090.05), whereas there was no difference in mortality if dialysis vintage was 6-12\u2009months or\u2009\u2265\u200924 months (P\u2009=\u20090.073 and P\u2009=\u20090.153, respectively). Overall, mortality of patients in group A was higher than that in group B after adjusting for age, race, chronic lung disease, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, haemoglobin and phosphate (hazard ratio\u2009=\u20091.335, 95% confidence interval\u2009=\u20091.172-1.520).Haemodialysis patients transferred to PD had higher mortality than those initiated on PD, strengthening the case for PD first policy."

    "content": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has shown a rising trend in the last two decades. It is one of the most devastating diseases which has an enormous psychosocial and economic burden. The treatment available includes haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and kidney transplantation. All treatment options have their pros and cons, needs and preferences, though haemodialysis is one of the most available entity in Pakistan. There are a few intrinsic problems associated with haemodialysis which has significant environmental as well as economic impact. One of the most important is the need of huge quantity of water to carry out the haemodialysis procedure along with production of solid waste in the form of disposables and electricity consumption. Peritoneal dialysis on the other hand is more environment-friendly and cost-effective and it should be one of the preferred options for our CKD patients."

    "content": "Observations that peritoneal dialysis (PD) may be an effective, lower-cost alternative to hemodialysis for the treatment of ESKD have led to policies encouraging PD and subsequent increases in its use in the United States.In a retrospective cohort analysis of Medicare beneficiaries who started dialysis between 2008 and 2015, we ascertained average annual expenditures (for up to 3 years after initiation of dialysis) for patients \u226567 years receiving in-center hemodialysis or PD. We also determined whether differences in Medicare expenditures across dialysis modalities persisted as more patients were placed on PD. We used propensity scores to match 8305 patients initiating PD with 8305 similar patients initiating hemodialysis.Overall average expenditures were US$108,656 (2017) for hemodialysis and US$91,716 for PD (proportionate difference, 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09 to 1.13). This difference did not change over time (<i>P</i> for time interaction term=0.14). Hemodialysis had higher estimated intravenous (iv) dialysis drug costs (1.69; 95% CI, 1.64 to 1.73), rehabilitation expenditures (1.35; 95% CI, 1.26 to 1.45), and other nondialysis expenditures (1.34; 95% CI, 1.30 to 1.37). Over time, initial differences in total dialysis expenditures disappeared and differences in iv dialysis drug utilization narrowed as nondialysis expenditures diverged. Estimated iv drug costs declined by US$2900 per patient-year in hemodialysis between 2008 and 2014 versus US$900 per patient-year in PD.From the perspective of the Medicare program, savings associated with PD in patients \u226567 years have remained unchanged, despite rapid growth in the use of this dialysis modality. Total dialysis expenditures for the two modalities converged over time, whereas nondialysis expenditures diverged."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Rates of cardiovascular mortality are disproportionately high in patients with end stage kidney disease receiving dialysis. However, it is now generally accepted that patient survival is broadly equivalent between the two most frequently used forms of dialysis, in-center hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD). This equivalent patient survival is notable when considering how specific aspects of HD have been shown to contribute to morbidity and mortality. These include more rapid loss of residual renal function (RRF), HD-induced myocardial and cerebral ischemia, and risk factors associated with the intermittent delivery of HD. Potential mechanisms specific to PD that may drive cardiovascular disease include the metabolic consequences of excessive absorption of glucose and glucose degradation products (GDPs), inadequate volume control, and high rates of hypokalemia. The aim of this review is to compare and contrast the different drivers of adverse outcomes between the dialysis modalities, as greater understanding of this may help in patient-centered decision-making when considering options for renal replacement therapy."

The subjects were divided into two groups according to their pre-dialysis blood pressure: a standard target group (pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure of 110-140\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg) and a relaxed target group (pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure of 155-165\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg). The Quality Metrics SF-36 survey instrument was used to assess health-related quality of life in the study participants. In addition, general clinical data and biochemical indicators including heart rate, respiration rate, blood pressure and ultrafiltration volume and rate during dialysis were observed and recorded. Patients were followed-up for 12\u00a0months, and prognostic data were recorded. Death was regarded as the endpoint.Scores on the SF-36 in the standard target group were significantly higher than those in the relaxed target group, with the exception of the role-emotional (RE) and mental health (MH) dimensions. At the end of the study, the number of mortality events in the relaxed target group was higher than in the standard target group. There were no other significant differences between the two groups.The scores from the health-related quality of life survey were higher in standard target group, but no differences in mortality risk between the two groups were observed."

Characteristics associated with weekly duration were evaluated using mixed-effects linear regression models with patient- and centre-level covariates as fixed effects, and dialysis centre and state as random effects using the 2017 prevalent in-centre haemodialysis (ICHD) and home haemodialysis (HHD) cohorts. Evaluation of patterns of weekly duration over time analysed the 2000 to 2017 incident ICHD and HHD cohorts.Overall, 12\u2009494 ICHD and 1493 HHD prevalent patients in 2017 were included. Median weekly treatment duration was 13.5 (interquartile range [IQR] 12-15) hours for ICHD and 16 (IQR 15-20) hours for HHD. Male sex, younger age, higher body mass index, arteriovenous fistula/graft use, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ethnicity and longer dialysis vintage were associated with longer weekly duration for both ICHD and HHD. No centre characteristics were associated with duration. Variability in duration across centres was very limited in ICHD compared with HHD, with variation in HHD being associated with state. Duration did not vary significantly over time for ICHD, whereas longer weekly HHD treatments were reported between 2006 and 2012 compared with before and after this period.This study in the Australian and New Zealand haemodialysis population showed that weekly duration was primarily associated with patient characteristics. No centre effect was demonstrated. Practice patterns seemed to differ across states/countries, with more variability in HHD than ICHD."

    "content": "The main objective of the study was to analyse the progression of residual renal function according to the dialysis technique (peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis) and the frequency of treatment (two or three sessions of haemodialysis per week). As secondary objectives, we studied the progression of the serum concentration levels of \u03b22 microglobulin and the response of anaemia to erythropoietic agents.193 non-anuric patients were included and began renal replacement therapy with dialysis in our hospital between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2011, with a follow-up period of over three months. 61 patients (32%) began treatment with two haemodialysis sessions per week, 49 patients (25%) with three haemodialysis sessions per week and 83 patients (43%) with peritoneal dialysis. The glomerular filtration rate was measured as the mean of the renal clearances of urea and creatinine.The rate of decrease in glomerular filtration was the same in patients who began treatment with two haemodialysis sessions per week and with peritoneal dialysis (median 0.18 ml/min/month) and it was higher in patients who began treatment with three sessions of haemodialysis per week (median 0.33 ml/min/month, P<.05). Throughout progression, the glomerular filtration rate did not display differences between the group that began with two weekly sessions of haemodialysis and the group on peritoneal dialysis, and it was lower in the group that began treatment with three sessions of haemodialysis per week with statistical significance during the first 24 months of follow up. In the three patient groups, \u03b22-microglobulin concentration increased as the glomerular filtration rate decreased and it was higher in the group on three weekly haemodialysis sessions for the first 12 months of follow up. In all the controls carried out, there was a negative correlation between the beta-2 microglobulin concentration and the glomerular filtration rate (P<.001). The erythropoietin dose was negatively related to glomerular filtration. Patients who began with two sessions of haemodialysis per week required a lower dose of erythropoietin than patients that began renal replacement therapy with three weekly sessions. The erythropoietin dose in the peritoneal dialysis group was below that of the group of two weekly haemodialysis sessions despite maintaining a similar glomerular filtration rate.Patients who begin treatment with two sessions of haemodialysis per week experience the same rate of decrease in residual renal function as patients treated with peritoneal dialysis. The progression of the concentration of \u03b22-microglobulin is parallel to that of the glomerular filtration rate. Patients treated with two haemodialysis sessions require a lower dose of erythropoietin than those who receive three sessions per week, but a significantly higher dose than those treated with peritoneal dialysis, which suggests that the response of anaemia to erythropoietic agents is not only related to residual renal function, but also to other factors that are inherent to the dialysis technique."

All studies reported a marked improvement in hip function following THA. There were 27 failures (15.7% revision rate) in the haemodialysis group and 101 failures (16.0% revision rate) in the transplant group. The revision rate for cemented implants was higher in haemodialysis versus transplant patients (23% vs. 15%), with the converse being true for uncemented implants (3.8% vs. 6.9%). The deep infection rate was higher in the haemodialysis group (10.8% vs. 2.1%).Patients receiving haemodialysis or with a history of renal transplantation can expect good functional outcome following THA. However, the revision rate and deep infection rate are higher than would be expected in patients receiving THA for primary OA. Aseptic loosening is the most common reason for revision. Uncemented implants appear to be associated with lower failure rates both in haemodialysis patients and those who have had a transplant."

The present study aimed to identify morphological and molecular characteristics of FLA isolates in dialysis fluid samples of hydraulic systems in hemodialysis units in Iran.A total of 328 dialysis fluid samples were collected from 16 dialysis machines, including 164 samples before hemodialysis sessions (after cleaning) and 164 samples after hemodialysis sessions (before cleaning). Filtration and cultivation were performed on non-nutrient agar medium. Also, PCR and sequencing were applied by using the genus-specific primers along with a common primer set on positive samples.Both morphology and molecular investigations showed that 22.5% (74/328) of dialysis fluid samples were positive for FLA. There was a positive relationship between the high frequency of FLA after hemodialysis sessions (before cleaning) compared with before hemodialysis sessions (after cleaning) (OR=2.86; 95% CI 1.5 to 5.45). Considering the PCR assay, 16.46% (54/328) samples were identified as Acanthamoeba spp. (belonging to T3 and T4 genotypes), 5.18% (17/328) as Vermamoeba vermiformis and 0.91% (3/328) as Vahlkampfiidae family (Naegleria australiensis, Naegleria pagei and Allovahlkampfia).The present results support a need to improve filtration and purification methods for dialysis fluid of hydraulic systems in hemodialysis units.

    "content": "Residual renal function (RRF) confers survival in patients with ESRD but declines after initiating hemodialysis. Previous research shows that dialysate cooling reduces hemodialysis-induced circulatory stress and protects the brain and heart from ischemic injury. Whether hemodialysis-induced circulatory stress affects renal perfusion, and if it can be ameliorated with dialysate cooling to potentially reduce RRF loss, is unknown.We used renal computed tomography perfusion imaging to scan 29 patients undergoing continuous dialysis under standard (36.5\u00b0C dialysate temperature) conditions; we also scanned another 15 patients under both standard and cooled (35.0\u00b0C) conditions. Imaging was performed immediately before, 3 hours into, and 15 minutes after hemodialysis sessions. We used perfusion maps to quantify renal perfusion. To provide a reference to another organ vulnerable to hemodialysis-induced ischemic injury, we also used echocardiography to assess intradialytic myocardial stunning.During standard hemodialysis, renal perfusion decreased 18.4% (<i>P</i><0.005) and correlated with myocardial injury (<i>r</i>=-0.33; <i>P</i><0.05). During sessions with dialysis cooling, patients experienced a 10.6% decrease in perfusion (not significantly different from the decline with standard hemodialysis), and ten of the 15 patients showed improved or no effect on myocardial stunning.This study shows an acute decrease in renal perfusion during hemodialysis, a first step toward pathophysiologic characterization of hemodialysis-mediated RRF decline. Dialysate cooling ameliorated this decline but this effect did not reach statistical significance. Further study is needed to explore the potential of dialysate cooling as a therapeutic approach to slow RRF decline."

We aimed to characterize and compare fatigue severity and fatigue interference with daily activities between dialysis and non-dialysis days.Hemodialysis patients self-reported fatigue on consecutive dialysis and non-dialysis days using the 9-item Brief Fatigue Inventory. The differences in fatigue characteristics between dialysis and non-dialysis days were analyzed using one-way\u00a0ANCOVA.Global fatigue burden was worse on a dialysis day compared to a non-dialysis day (P for all <\u20090.001). Age and education were associated with fatigue, but hemodialysis-related variables were not. A significant inverse association of physical activity with fatigue severity observed on non-dialysis day; there was also a negative association between the normalized protein catabolic rate and fatigue severity on both dialysis and non-dialysis days. The positive association of depression with fatigue severity and fatigue interference were consistent on both dialysis and non-dialysis days. None of these factors, however, explained differences in fatigue characteristics between dialysis and non-dialysis days.Fatigue, measured in severity and interference, was more pronounced on a dialysis day relative to a non-dialysis day. These differences were not explained by age, sex, education, hemodialysis-related variables, habitual exercise, nutritional status, and or depression. The quantitative measures of fatigue characteristics may facilitate future interventional trials design and better fatigue management for hemodialysis patients."

    "content": "Post-dialysis recovery time (DRT) has an important relationship to quality of life and survival, as identified in studies of ESRD patients on conventional dialysis. ESRD patients are often discharged from hospitals to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) where on-site treatment using home hemodialysis technology is increasingly offered, but nothing is known about DRT in this patient population.From November 4, 2019 to June 11, 2021, within a dialysis organization providing service across 12 states and 154 SNFs, patients receiving in-SNF, more frequent dialysis (MFD) (modeled to deliver 14 treatment hours minimum per week and stdKt/V \u22652.0) were asked to describe their post-dialysis recovery time following their previous treatment, within predefined categoric choices: 0-\u00bd, \u00bd-1, 1-2, 2-4, 4-8, 8-12\u2009h, by next morning, or not even by next morning. Patients reporting DRT following at least one full-week treatment opportunity were included in a mixed model logistic regression of rapid recovery (DRT \u22642\u00a0h).Two thousand three hundred and nine patients met the statistical modeling inclusion criteria, providing DRT on 108,876 dialysis sessions, while receiving mean (SD) 4.3 (0.96) weekly dialysis treatments. 2118 (92%) reported DRT \u22642\u00a0h. Results appeared biologically plausible, as lower odds of rapid DRT were observed for patients who were older, missed their previous treatment, or experienced intradialytic hypotension. Greater odds of rapid DRT were observed in patients receiving five dialyses in the previous week or having 160-179\u00a0mmHg pre-hemodialysis systolic blood pressure. Rapid recovery was associated with reduced mortality or hospitalization.SNF dialysis patients receiving 5x per week MFD report rapid recovery time \u22642\u2009h in 92% of dialyses despite advanced age, frailty, and comorbidities. Future studies will assess the practical ramifications of rapid DRT perception/experience on nursing home rehabilitation programs, which could impact patient health beyond the nursing home stay."

    "title": "Renal Association Clinical Practice Guideline on Haemodialysis.",
    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "This guideline is written primarily for doctors and nurses working in dialysis units and related areas of medicine in the UK, and is an update of a previous version written in 2009. It aims to provide guidance on how to look after patients and how to run dialysis units, and provides standards which units should in general aim to achieve. We would not advise patients to interpret the guideline as a rulebook, but perhaps to answer the question: \"what does good quality haemodialysis look like?\"The guideline is split into sections: each begins with a few statements which are graded by strength (1 is a firm recommendation, 2 is more like a sensible suggestion), and the type of research available to back up the statement, ranging from A (good quality trials so we are pretty sure this is right) to D (more like the opinion of experts than known for sure). After the statements there is a short summary explaining why we think this, often including a discussion of some of the most helpful research. There is then a list of the most important medical articles so that you can read further if you want to - most of this is freely available online, at least in summary form.A few notes on the individual sections: 1. This section is about how much dialysis a patient should have. The effectiveness of dialysis varies between patients because of differences in body size and age etc., so different people need different amounts, and this section gives guidance on what defines \"enough\" dialysis and how to make sure each person is getting that. Quite a bit of this section is very technical, for example, the term \"eKt/V\" is often used: this is a calculation based on blood tests before and after dialysis, which measures the effectiveness of a single dialysis session in a particular patient. 2. This section deals with \"non-standard\" dialysis, which basically means anything other than 3 times per week. For example, a few people need 4 or more sessions per week to keep healthy, and some people are fine with only 2 sessions per week - this is usually people who are older, or those who have only just started dialysis. Special considerations for children and pregnant patients are also covered here. 3. This section deals with membranes (the type of \"filter\" used in the dialysis machine) and \"HDF\" (haemodiafiltration) which is a more complex kind of dialysis which some doctors think is better. Studies are still being done, but at the moment we think it's as good as but not better than regular dialysis. 4. This section deals with fluid removal during dialysis sessions: how to remove enough fluid without causing cramps and low blood pressure. Amongst other recommendations we advise close collaboration with patients over this. 5. This section deals with dialysate, which is the fluid used to \"pull\" toxins out of the blood (it is sometimes called the \"bath\"). The level of things like potassium in the dialysate is important, otherwise too much or too little may be removed. There is a section on dialysate buffer (bicarbonate) and also a section on phosphate, which occasionally needs to be added into the dialysate. 6. This section is about anticoagulation (blood thinning) which is needed to stop the circuit from clotting, but sometimes causes side effects. 7. This section is about certain safety aspects of dialysis, not seeking to replace well-established local protocols, but focussing on just a few where we thought some national-level guidance would be useful. 8. This section draws together a few aspects of dialysis which don't easily fit elsewhere, and which impact on how dialysis feels to patients, rather than the medical outcome, though of course these are linked. This is where home haemodialysis and exercise are covered. There is an appendix at the end which covers a few aspects in more detail, especially the mathematical ideas. Several aspects of dialysis are not included in this guideline since they are covered elsewhere, often because they are aspects which affect non-dialysis patients too. This includes: anaemia, calcium and bone health, high blood pressure, nutrition, infection control, vascular access, transplant planning, and when dialysis should be started."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "The physical decline in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is associated with morbidity and mortality. Prior studies have attempted to promote physical activity at the time of dialysis; however, physical activity patterns on the nondialysis days are unknown. This study aimed to quantify physical activity on dialysis and nondialysis days in hemodialysis patients using a wearable actigraph.In this prospective study, subjects receiving hemodialysis were recruited from two outpatient dialysis units in urban San Diego and rural Imperial County, CA, between March 2018 and April 2019. Key inclusion criteria included: (1) receiving thrice weekly hemodialysis for \u22653\u2009months, (2) age\u2009\u2265\u200918\u2009years, and (3) able to walk with or without assistive devices. All participants wore a Fitbit Charge 2 tracker for a minimum of 4\u2009weeks. The primary outcome was the number of steps per day. Each participant completed the Physical Activity Questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9, the PROMIS Short form Fatigue Questionnaire at baseline, and the Participant Technology Experience Questionnaire at day 7 after study enrolment.Of the 52 recruited, 45 participants (urban = 25; rural = 20) completed the study. The mean age was 61\u2009\u00b1\u200915\u2009years, 42% were women, 64% were Hispanic, and the mean dialysis vintage was 4.4\u2009\u00b1\u20093.0\u2009years. For those with valid Fitbit data (defined as \u226510\u2009hours of wear per day) for 28\u2009days (n = 45), participants walked an average of 3688 steps per day, and 73% of participants were sedentary (<5000\u2009steps/day). Participants aged >80\u2009years were less active than younger (age\u2009<\u200965\u2009years) participants (1232 vs. 4529 steps, P = 0.01). There were no statistical differences between the groups when stratified by gender (women vs. men [2817 vs. 4324 steps, respectively]), urbanicity (rural vs. urban dialysis unit [3141 vs. 4123 steps, respectively]), and dialysis/nondialysis day (3177 vs. 4133 steps, respectively). Due to the small sample size, we also calculated effect sizes. The effect size was medium for the gender differences (cohen's d = 0.57) and small to medium for urbanicity and dialysis/nondialysis day (d = 0.37 and d = 0.33, respectively). We found no association between physical activity and self-reported depression and fatigue scale. The majority of participants (62%, 28/45) found the Fitbit tracker easy to wear and comfortable.ESKD participants receiving hemodialysis are frequently sedentary, and differences appear more pronounced in older patients. These findings may assist in designing patient-centered interventions to increase physical activity among hemodialysis patients."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Background Benefits of patients with end-stage renal disease and atrial fibrillation undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) or hemodialysis are unknown. Methods and Results Patients undergoing dialysis were retrieved from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database during 2001 to 2013 and separated into PD or hemodialysis. Primary outcomes were ischemic stroke/systemic embolism, major bleeding, and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). An inverse probability of treatment weighting based on propensity score was used to reduce the confounding. The risk of outcomes between PD and hemodialysis was compared using Cox proportional hazard model for fatal outcomes or Fine and Gray subdistribution hazard model which considered death a competing risk, respectively. A total of 7916 patients with end-stage renal disease with atrial fibrillation undergoing PD or hemodialysis during 2001 to 2013 were identified. After exclusion criteria, 363 patients receiving PD and 5302 patients receiving hemodialysis were analyzed. At 1-year follow-up, the risk of ICH was significantly lower in the PD group compared with the hemodialysis group (0.2% versus 0.9%; subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR], 0.31; 95% CI, 0.17-0.57). At 3-year follow-up, the risks of major bleeding and ICH were significantly lower in the PD group compared with the hemodialysis group (major bleeding: 1.8% versus 3.2%; SHR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.53-0.87; ICH: 0.5% versus 2%; SHR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.21-0.48). At 5-year follow-up, ischemic stroke/systemic embolism, major bleeding, and ICH were significantly lower in the PD group compared with the hemodialysis group (ischemic stroke/systemic embolism: 12.4% versus 17.7%, SHR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.79-0.96; major bleeding: 2.6% versus 4.1%; SHR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64-0.97; ICH: 0.5% versus 2.6%; SHR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.17-0.37). Conclusions In patients with end-stage renal disease and atrial fibrillation, dialytic modalities by PD or hemodialysis impacted these patients differently. There were overall reduced ischemic stroke/systemic embolism, major bleeding, and ICH at 5-year follow-up in patients undergoing PD compared with hemodialysis."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Technique failure, defined as death or transfer to haemodialysis (HD), is a major concern in peritoneal dialysis (PD). Nurse-assisted PD is globally associated with a lower risk of transfer to HD. We aimed to evaluate the association between assisted PD and the risk of the different causes of transfer to HD.This was a retrospective study using data from the French Language PD Registry of patients on incident PD from 2006 to 2015. The association between the use of assisted PD and the causes of transfer to HD was evaluated using survival analysis with competing events in unmatched and propensity score-matched cohorts.The study included 11\u2009093 incident PD patients treated in 123 French PD units. There were 4273 deaths, 3330 transfers to HD and 2210 renal transplantations. The causes of transfer to HD were inadequate dialysis (1283), infection (524), catheter-related problems (334), social issues (250), other causes linked to PD (422), other causes not linked to PD (481) and encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (6). Nurse-assisted PD patients were older and more comorbid. Assistance by nurse was associated with a higher risk of death [cause-specific hazard ratio (cs-HR) 2.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.26-2.74], but with a lower risk of transfer to HD [subdistributionHR (sd-HR) 0.68, 95% CI 0.62-0.76], especially due to inadequate dialysis (cs-HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75-0).The lower risk of transfer to HD associated with nurse assistance should encourage decision makers to launch reimbursement programmes in countries where it is not available."

Direct meta-analyses were conducted first. Aerobic capacity improved significantly more with aerobic training (3.35 ml/kg/min, 95% CI 1.79 to 4.91) and combined training (5.00 ml/kg/min, 95% CI 3.50 to 6.50) than with control. Only combined training significantly reduced systolic (-9 mmHg, 95% CI\u00a0-13 to\u00a0-4) and diastolic (-5 mmHg, 95% CI\u00a0-6 to\u00a0-3) blood pressure compared to control. Only aerobic training was superior to control for haemodialysis efficiency (Kt/V 0.11, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.20). However, when network meta-analysis was conducted, there were some important different findings. Both aerobic training and combined training again elicited greater improvements in aerobic capacity than control. For systolic blood pressure, combined training was superior to control. For diastolic blood pressure, combined training was superior to aerobic training and control. No modality was superior to control for haemodialysis efficiency. Combined training was ranked as the most effective treatment for aerobic capacity and arterial blood pressure.Combined training was the most effective modality to increase aerobic capacity and blood pressure control in people who require haemodialysis. This finding helps to fill the gap created by the lack of head-to-head comparisons of different modalities of exercise in people with end-stage renal disease.PROSPERO CRD42015020531."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Recent studies have revealed unique biological characteristics of molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) as an anti-inflammatory agent. We developed a novel haemodialysis (E-HD) system delivering an H<sub>2</sub> (30-80 ppb)-enriched dialysis solution by water electrolysis, and conducted a non-randomized, non-blinded, prospective observational study exploring its clinical impact. Prevalent chronic HD patients were allocated to either the E-HD (n\u2009=\u2009161) group or the conventional HD (C-HD: n\u2009=\u2009148) group, and received the respective HD treatments during the study. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality and development of non-lethal cardio-cerebrovascular events (cardiac disease, apoplexy, and leg amputation due to peripheral artery disease). During the 3.28-year mean observation period, there were no differences in dialysis parameters between the two groups; however, post-dialysis hypertension was ameliorated with significant reductions in antihypertensive agents in the E-HD patients. There were 91 events (50 in the C-HD group and 41 in the E-HD group). Multivariate analysis of the Cox proportional hazards model revealed E-HD as an independent significant factor for the primary endpoint (hazard ratio 0.59; [95% confidence interval: 0.38-0.92]) after adjusting for confounding factors (age, cardiovascular disease history, serum albumin, and C-reactive protein).

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Compared to traditional in-center hemodialysis (HD), in-center nocturnal dialysis (INHD) is characterized by longer sessions and nighttime administration, which may lead to better outcomes for some patients. Given the importance of patient choice in the decision to initiate INHD, we explored associations between patients' psychosocial characteristics and their receipt of INHD.Among hemodialysis patients at a medium-sized dialysis organization, we identified INHD patients as those for whom \u226580% of dialysis sessions were INHD sessions-starting at 6:30\u2009pm or later and lasting \u22655\u2009hours-over the 3\u2009months (\u226520 sessions total) after their first INHD session. We extracted dialysis session data from electronic medical records and psychosocial data from social worker assessments. We tested associations of patients' psychosocial characteristics-as well as demographic and clinical characteristics-with INHD receipt among all hemodialysis patients (INHD and HD) in bivariate analyses and multivariable logistic regression models.Among 759 patients with complete data, we identified 47 (6.2%) as INHD patients. On average, these patients were more likely than HD patients to be employed (full-time 10.6% vs. 5.2%; part-time 17.0% vs. 4.2%; P\u2009<\u20090.001), and they were significantly less likely to require ambulatory assistance (14.9% vs. 39.6%, P\u2009<\u20090.001). In multivariable regressions, we found that part-time employment (versus being unemployed) was associated with a 7.1 percentage-point higher likelihood of being an INHD patient (P = 0.01), and the negative association with ambulatory assistance needs approached statistical significance (P = 0.056). No other psychosocial factors included in this main regression analysis were statistically significantly associated with INHD patient status.Researchers comparing the outcomes of patients undergoing INHD versus other treatment modalities will need to account for differences in employment status-and other factors like requiring ambulatory assistance and age which may predict the ability to work-between INHD users and comparison patients to avoid bias in estimates."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) treated by hemodialysis (HD) is a worldwide major public health problem. Its incidence is getting higher and higher, leading to an alarming social and economic impact. The survival of these patients is significantly low, especially during the first year of treatment. The purpose of our study was to identify the epidemiological and clinico-biological characteristics of patients at the HD initiation and to reveal the predictive factors of mortality at three months and one year of HD. This is a prospective, analytical, and descriptive study dealing with 229 patients with an end-stage renal disease (ESRD), followed up in the Nephrology Department of Charles Nicolle Hospital and La Rabta Hospital in Tunisia, that was started HD between January and June 2017. A multivariate logistic regression analysis allowed us to identify the independent predictors of mortality at three months and one year. The average age was 60.2 \u00b1 15.3 years, with a gender ratio of 1.41. Seventy-eight percent of patients had more than two comorbidities, 59% had diabetes, and 88% had hypertension. Diabetic nephropathy was the leading etiology of kidney disease (48.9%), while 11% of nephropathies were of unknown etiology. Only 58% were early referred to a nephrologist. The average glomerular filtration rate at HD initiation was 6.06 \u00b1 2.33 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia were noted, respectively, in 60.8% and 84.9% of cases. Anemia was objectified in 98.6% of cases. HD was started in an emergency in 56.8% of cases. One of the most urgent indications was acute pulmonary edema (APE) for 43.8% of patients. Only 10.5% of patients had functional arteriovenous fistula at the dialysis initiation. Patients were hemodialyzed one, two, or three sessions per week, respectively, in 23.2%, 26.6%, and 50.2% of cases. The crude mortality rate was 25% and 13% in, respectively, one year and three months of HD. On multivariate analysis, we identified heart failure and insufficient dialysis dose per week as predictive factors of mortality at the 1<sup>st</sup> year of HD. C-reactive protein more than 21 mg/L, insufficient dialysis per week, modified Charlson Comorbidity Index less than 6, and APE at the dialysis initiation were identified as predictive factors of three-month mortality. Despite the short period of study, this work revealed the alarming conditions of patients at HD initiation. This critical situation is due to the delay in CKD diagnosis, the late nephrologist referral, and the lack of preparation before HD initiation."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is the advanced stage of a progressive loss of kidney function. About 10% of all patients with lupus nephritis (LN) eventually progress to ESRD, which may necessitate renal replacement therapy (RRT), such as hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD), and/or kidney transplant. Research hasn't confirmed which dialysis options, prior to kidney transplantation, are beneficial to patients' prognoses.The study intended to compare the risks-related to disease activity, exercise, all-cause infection, all-cause cardiovascular events, and mortality-of the use of HD and PD for LN-ESRD adults, as the initial alternative treatment before renal transplantation.The research team performed a narrative review and analyzed the data obtained about clinical outcomes for HD and peritoneal dialysis. For the review, the research team searched the PubMed, EMBASE, and SCOPUS databases. The search used the keywords: end-stage renal disease, renal replacement therapy, hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.The study made in Affiliated Hospital of Hebei University, China.The studies included 15 636 patients who had been diagnosed with LN-ESRD prior to renal transplantation.For the data analysis, the research team divided the data into two groups, one of which included the data on the clinical outcomes for HD patientsand one of which included the data on the clinical outcomes for PD patients. The study evaluated four types of risks: lupus-flare risks, all-cause infection risks, all-cause cardiovascular events risk, and risk of mortality.The 16 studies found in the review reported one or more outcomes of interest for the two dialysis modalities, HD and PD. The analysis of the data from the 16 studies showed that HD was associated with a higher risk than PD: (1) of lupus flares, with RR = 1.23 (confidence interval: 0.82, 1.85), but the difference didn't reach statistical significance (P = .31); (2) of all-cause infection risk, with RR = 1.02 (confidence interval: 0.66, 1.59), but the difference didn't reach statistical significance (P = .92); (3) of all-cause cardiovascular events, with RR = 1.44 (confidence interval: 1.02, 2.04), and the difference reached statistical significance (P = .04); and (4) of mortality risk, with RR = 1.29 (confidence interval: 0.95, 1.75), but the difference didn't reach statistical significance (P = .10).The current study may have reference significance for clinical treatment of ESRD. Except for all-cause cardiovascular events in which PD was superior to HD, offering better outcomes, both treatment modalities provide more or less similar clinical outcomes as effective initial choices for RRT in LN-ESRD patients prior to renal transplant. The current research team, however, encourages further research on the question, addressing better the possible sources of biases encountered in the current study."

After covariate adjustment, the association of age, sex, dialysis vintage, diabetes, and functional status with PROs was similar in both modalities, with women having lower PCS and kidney disease burden scores. Lower functional status (score\u00a0<11) was strongly associated with lower PCS and MCS scores, a much greater burden of kidney disease, and greater likelihood of depression symptoms (CES-D, >10). The median change in KDQOL-based PROs was negligible over 1 year in participants who completed at least 2 annual questionnaires.Selection bias due to incomplete survey responses. Generalizability was limited to the dialysis populations of the included countries.Variation exists in quality of life, burden of kidney disease, and depression across countries but did not appreciably change over time. Functional status remained one of the strongest predictors of all PROs. Routine assessment of functional status may provide valuable insights for patients and providers in anticipating outcomes and support needs for patients receiving either PD or HD."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Daily haemodialysis improves patients' quality of life and blood purification, but its effect on survival remains controversial. The aim of this study was to analyze the association between daily haemodialysis and renal transplantation and survival in France.This was an observational cohort study based on the French REIN registry. All incident patients \u226518 years old who started daily haemodialysis in France between 2003 and 2012 were included. Using a propensity score, 575 patients on daily haemodialysis were matched with 1696 patients receiving thrice-weekly haemodialysis. Survival analysis was performed using the Cox model. Access to the renal transplant waiting list and renal transplantation were analyzed using the Fine and Gray model.Daily haemodialysis was not independently associated with reduced access to transplant waiting list, whereas, major comorbidities remained associated with restricted waitlisting after multivariate analysis adjusted for confounding factors. After being waitlisted, the cumulative incidence of renal transplantation was lower for the daily haemodialysis than for the thrice-weekly haemodialysis group (SHR\u00a0=\u00a00.72, 95%CI: 0.56-0.91). The risk of death was significantly higher in the daily haemodialysis group (HR<sub>adjusted</sub> \u00a0=\u00a01.58, 95%CI: 1.4-1.8). Major comorbidities were associated with higher risk of death and lower likelihood of receiving a renal transplant during the follow-up period.Our study showed that in France, the likelihood of undergoing renal transplantation after being waitlisted was lower for patients on daily haemodialysis than those on thrice-weekly haemodialysis. Moreover, daily haemodialysis was associated with higher risk of death, even after taking into account age and all major comorbidities."

    "title": "How to meet the demand for good quality renal dialysis as part of universal health coverage in resource-limited settings?",
    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "It is very challenging for resource-limited settings to introduce universal health coverage (UHC), particularly regarding the inclusion of high-cost renal dialysis as part of the UHC benefit package. This paper addresses three issues: (1) whether a setting commits to include renal dialysis in its UHC benefit package and if so, why and how; (2) how to ensure quality of renal dialysis services; and (3) how to improve the quality of life of patients using psychosocial and community interventions.This article reviews experiences of renal dialysis programs in seven settings based on presentations and discussions during the International Forum on Peritoneal Dialysis as a Priority Health Policy in Asia. A literature review was conducted to verify and validate the data as well as to fill information gaps presented in the forum. Five out of the seven settings implemented renal dialysis as part of their benefits package, while the other two have pilots or programs in their nascent stage. Renal replacement therapy has become part of the universal access package because these governments recognize the rising number of chronic kidney disease (CKD) cases, the catastrophically high costs of treatment, and that this is the only life-saving treatment available to patients. The recommendations are as follows: Governments should have a holistic approach to CKD interventions, including primary prevention as well as psychosocial interventions. Governments should consider subsidizing CKD treatment costs depending on their resources. Multi-stakeholder cooperation should be facilitated to enact these policies and conduct research and development for all aspects of interventions. International collaboration should be initiated to share experiences, good practices, and joint activities (e.g. capacity building and multinational procurement of medical supplies).This study provides practical recommendations to country governments as well as the international community on how to meet the demand for good quality renal dialysis as part of UHC in resource-limited settings."

    "content": "Dialysis patients have an increased bleeding risk as compared with the general population. However, there is limited information whether bleeding risks are different for patients treated with haemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD). From a clinical point of view, this information could influence therapy choice. Therefore the aim of this study was to investigate the association between dialysis modality and bleeding risk.Incident dialysis patients from the Netherlands Cooperative Study on the Adequacy of Dialysis were prospectively followed for major bleeding events over 3\u2009years. Hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for HD compared with PD using a time-dependent Cox regression analysis, with updates on dialysis modality.In total, 1745 patients started dialysis, of whom 1211 (69.4%) received HD and 534 (30.6%) PD. The bleeding rate was 60.8/1000 person-years for HD patients and 34.6/1000 person-years for PD patients. The time-dependent Cox regression analysis showed that after adjustment for age, sex, primary kidney disease, prior bleeding, cardiovascular disease, antiplatelet drug use, vitamin K antagonist use, erythropoietin use, arterial hypertension, residual glomerular filtratin rate, haemoglobin and albumin levels, bleeding risk for HD patients compared with PD increased 1.5-fold (95% CI 1.0-2.2).In this large prospective cohort of incident dialysis patients, HD patients had an increased bleeding risk compared with PD patients. In particular, HD patients with a history of prior bleeding had an increased bleeding risk."

Relevant studies published before June 2015 were searched. Pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to evaluate the effect of HD and PD on RA based on five indexes: hemoglobin, ferritin, transferrin saturation index, serum albumin, and parathyroid hormone. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias assessment were conducted to evaluate the stability and reliability of our results. A total of fourteen eligible studies with 1103 cases underwent HD and 625 cases underwent PD were used for this meta-analysis. There were no significant difference for levels of hemoglobin (SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.23, 95% CI: -0.74 to 0.28), ferritin (SMD\u2009=\u20090.01, 95% CI: -0.59 to 0.62), parathyroid hormone (SMD\u2009=\u20090.11, 95% CI: -1.53 to 1.75) and transferrin saturation index (SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.06, 95% CI: -0.67 to 0.56) between HD and PD group. However, the content of serum albumin in HD group was much more than that in PD group (SMD\u2009=\u20091.58, 95% CI: 0.35 to 2.81). Neither of the included studies could reverse the pooled side effect and Egger's test demonstrated no publication bias.

    "content": "Hemodialysis patients have high rates of sudden death, but relationships between serum electrolytes, the dialysis prescription, and intra-dialytic shifts in fluid and electrolyte with arrhythmia are uncertain.We analyzed sixty-six hemodialysis patients who underwent loop recorder implantation with continuous electrocardiographic monitoring, weekly to bi-weekly testing of pre- and post-dialysis electrolytes, and detailed capture of dialysis prescription and flow sheet data for 6\u2009months. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) of reviewer confirmed arrhythmias (RCA) during dialysis through 8\u2009h after dialysis and associations with serum chemistries and dialytic parameters were assessed using adjusted, negative-binomial regression.Among 66 individuals with a mean age of 56\u2009years, 12,480 events were detected in 64 (97%) patients. RCA nadired 12-24\u2009h after dialysis and increased during the final 12\u2009h of the inter-dialytic interval through the first 8\u2009h after dialysis. Higher pre-dialysis serum magnesium concentration was associated with lower incidence rate ratio for arrythmia (IRR per 1\u2009mg/dL increase 0.49, 95% CI; 0.25, 0.94), as was dialysate calcium concentration\u2009>\u20092.5\u2009mEq/L vs. 2.5\u2009mEq/L (IRR 0.52, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.70).

However, there was effect modification such that arrhythmia rate was maximal with concurrently high intradialytic volume and potassium removal (P<sub>interaction</sub>\u2009=\u20090.01).Intra and post-dialytic arrhythmias are common in hemodialysis. Additional studies designed to further elucidate whether modification of the serum magnesium concentration, dialysate calcium concentration, and the extent of intradialytic potassium and fluid removal reduces the risk of per-dialytic arrhythmia are warranted.Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01779856.

The search time was set from 2010 to 2021. Meta-analysis was performed using Stata16.0. The treatment group received PD, while the control group was given HD.Out of 317 articles initially retrieved, 14 studies were finally included in our meta-analysis. The analysis results showed that there was no marked difference in the 1-year survival rate between the two groups (RR = 1.05; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.10; <i>P</i> > 0.05), but the incidence rate of adverse reactions in the treatment group was significantly lower than that in the control group (RR = 0.51; 95% CI: 0.37, 0.70; <i>P</i> < 0.05). In addition, PD and HD treatments caused significant decreases in serum creatinine levels (PD, SMD = -2.91; 95% CI: -3.79, -2.04; <i>P</i> < 0.05; HD, SMD = -3.09; 95% CI: -4.01, -2.16; <i>P</i> < 0.05) and blood urea nitrogen levels (PD, SMD = -2.54, 95% CI: -3.37, -1.72, <i>P</i> < 0.05; HD, SMD = -2.62, 95% CI: -3.47, -1.77, <i>P</i> < 0.05); however, there was no significant statistical difference in posttreatment levels of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen between the two groups. Compared with the control group, the hemoglobin (SMD = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.07, 1.06; <i>P</i> < 0.05) and serum albumin (SMD = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.46, 1.76, <i>P</i> < 0.05) levels were significantly increased in the treatment group after treatment.In summary, both PD and HD can improve renal function in uremic patients, but PD is superior to HD in reducing the incidence of adverse reactions, improving the nutritional status, and therefore improving the quality of life of patients."

In the first stage, search terms and strategies were used to narrow the relevant articles. In the second stage, the data were extracted from the included articles. In the third stage, the data were analyzed using thematic analysis, and the results were presented in the form of attributes, antecedents, consequences, surrogate terms, and related terms. We found additional instruments and interventions and presented a model case to emphasize the practicality of the concept. In the fourth phase, experts contributed to the discussion and interpretation of the findings.A total of 22 articles were included. Four attributes of learned helplessness in renal dialysis patients were identified: low self-concept, perceived loss, negative cognitive set, and abandonment of action. The antecedents were sociodemographic characteristics, disease and treatment, and psychological factors. Consequences were separated into four themes: psychological problems, physiological problems, quality of life, and health-related behavior. Surrogate terms are hopelessness and powerlessness, and the related term is depression.The process of conceptual analysis in this study provides a means of identifying awareness gaps and practice challenges of learned helplessness in renal dialysis patients and other concepts. The findings can be used to guide the design of tools and interventions to expand the use of learned helplessness theory in nursing."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Chronic pre-dialysis hyponatremia is not rare in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. However, the association between chronic pre-dialysis hyponatremia and mortality is uncertain due to multiple potential confounders such as hyperglycemia, fluid overload, and malnutrition. This study aimed to more comprehensively evaluate the association between chronic pre-dialysis hyponatremia and clinical outcomes in MHD patients.We analyzed the data of 194 MHD patients with regular real-time measurements of pre-dialysis serum sodium from July 2015 to March 2021. Hyponatremia was defined as SNa\u2009\u2264\u2009135\u00a0mmol/L and normonatremia as SNa\u2009>\u2009135\u00a0mmol/L and\u2009<\u2009145\u00a0mmol/L. We evaluated the association of baseline pre-dialysis serum sodium (SNa) and time-averaged SNa (TASNa) levels with all-cause mortality or new major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in MHD patients. Furthermore, the SNa levels were glucose, serum albumin, and fluid overload adjusted. The associations between SNa levels and all-cause mortality or new MACE were analyzed using time-varying Cox regression models.Among the total of 194 patients, 24 patients died and 45 new MACE occurred during a mean 35.2-month follow-up period. The baseline pre-dialysis SNa level was 137.1\u2009\u00b1\u20092.8\u00a0mmol/L (127-144\u00a0mmol/L). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that there were no significant differences in all-cause mortality or new MACE between hyponatremia and normonatremia groups according to baseline pre-dialysis SNa or glucose-corrected SNa (gcSNa). The mean values of both TASNa and time-averaged glucose-corrected SNa (TAgcSNa) were 136.9\u2009\u00b1\u20092.4\u00a0mmol/L and 138.3\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0\u00a0mmol/L, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with pre-dialysis hyponatremia had higher all-cause mortality or new MACE compared with normonatremia patients whether grouped on TASNa or TAgcSNa. Cox models showed an increased risk of all-cause mortality and new MACE in MHD patients with pre-dialysis hyponatremia based on TASNa or TAgcSNa. Even after full adjustment including time-dependent age and dialysis vintage, gender, diabetes, time-averaged weight gain (TAWG), and serum albumin, patients with pre-dialysis hyponatremia based on TASNa (HR 2.89; 95% CI 1.18-7.04; model 3) or TAgcSNa (HR 5.03; 95% CI 1.87-13.57; model 3) had approximately twofold or fourfold greater risk of all-cause mortality, respectively, compared with those with normonatremia. The risk of new MACE was also significantly elevated in patients with pre-dialysis hyponatremia based on TASNa (HR 3.86; 95% CI 2.13-7.01; model 1) or TAgcSNa (HR 2.43; 95% CI 1.14-5.15; model 1). After adjustment for time-dependent age and dialysis vintage, gender, diabetes, TAWG, and serum albumin, patients with pre-dialysis hyponatremia based on TASNa (HR 2.33; 95% CI 1.16-4.68; model 3) had a higher risk of new MACE compared with those with normonatremia.Pre-dialysis time-averaged hyponatremia is independently associated with increased risks of all-cause mortality or new MACE in MHD patients. The baseline SNa level is not a predictor of clinical outcomes due to its variation over time. Hyperglycemia, fluid overload, and malnutrition do not have a significant impact on the risk association between chronic hyponatremia and all-cause mortality or new MACE in MHD patients."

The aim of the study was to determine the outcome of cuffed tunneled dialysis catheter used for hemodialysis at a teaching hospital.A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted between January 2014 and December 2019 on 103 chronic dialysis patients with end-stage renal disease presenting to a tertiary care hospital. Ethical approval was received from the institutional review board (2/(6-11) E2/076/77). Whole sampling was done. Data entry and analysis were done in Microsoft Excel 10.The study included 103 patients with 117 cuffed tunneled dialysis catheters placed for hemodialysis. On assessing the outcome of the catheters, the primary and secondary patency rates of the catheters were 5.85\u00b14.87 and 1.21\u00b13.77 months. Thirty-one (30.1%) patients required one intervention, and 11 (10.68%) catheters required 3 or more interventions to maintain patency. Eighteen (17.48%) patients presented with catheter dysfunction while in 11 (10.68%) cases, the catheter was kinked or malpositioned at the notch. In one patient, procedure was abandoned due to severe bleeding and in 2 (1.94%) patients dialysis catheters could not be negotiated into the right atrium and left in brachiocephalic junction.Cuffed tunneled dialysis catheter is effective for maintenance hemodialysis in patients with the end-stage renal disease if used with proper care during dialysis even in our setup. The results and outcomes of the procedure are at par with standards."

The present study examined the circulatory levels of a wide panel of trace elements (Al, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Rb, Sr, Cd, Pb, and U) in hemodialysis patients (HD group) and pre-dialysis patients with stage 3 CKD (PD group). Comparisons were made between groups of patients and healthy individuals from the control group (CG). The levels of Al, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, As, Se, Sr, and Pb were higher, while the levels of Cr, Zn, Rb, Cd, and U were lower in HD patients than in our CG. Higher levels of Al and Se, as well as lower levels of As, Sr, Zn, Rb, and U were significant and distinguished HD from PD. Among other analyzed elements, Co, Se, and U are the only trace elements that did not distinguish PD from CG at a statistically significant level. The HD group had lower serum U levels than the PD group, and this could be a result of hemodialysis. This study also revealed that the Cu/Zn ratio could be used as a marker for early and late detection of renal failure. Marked changes of essential and toxic trace element levels in sera indicate additional pathophysiological events in CKD, which could additionally contribute to the preexisting increased morbidity of HD patients. Measurement of trace elements in HD patients should be performed routinely."

CRP levels, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were collected. Kt was obtained by ionic dialysance and urea distribution volume was calculated from the Watson's formula. The sample was divided into two groups, taking the median CRP as the cut-off point. Dialysis adequacy obtained in each group was compared. Finally, a logistic regression model was carried out to determine the variables with the greatest influence.Median CRP was 4.10\u2009mg/L (q25-q75: 1.67-10) and mean Kt/V was 1.48\u2009\u00b1\u20090.308. Kt/V was lower in the patients included in the high inflammation group (p\u2009=\u20090.01). In the multivariate logistic regression, the \"high\" levels of CRP were directly correlated with the Log INL (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and inversely proportional with serum albumin values (p\u2009=\u20090.014), Kt/V (p\u2009=\u20090.037) and serum iron (p\u2009<\u20090.001).The poorer adequacy in terms of dialysis doses, lower Kt / V values, may contribute to a higher degree of inflammation in chronic hemodialysis patients."

Despite this alarming increase in the incidence of cancer, to date, whether the risk of developing cancer differs among peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) patients is still uncertain. In this retrospective cohort study, data were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan, which provides coverage to almost 99% of the nation's population. After matching, a total of 4491 (or 3369) incident PD patients and 8982 (or 6738) incident HD patients between 2000 and 2009 were enrolled from the database. In addition, 22,455 (or 16,845) nondialysis patients were selected as a control group. The patients were monitored for the occurrence of cancer until 2010, and their data were analyzed using several different models. In general, the results showed that the risks of hepatocellular, kidney, bladder, extra kidney/bladder urinary tract, and thyroid cancers were higher in dialysis patients. We also compared the risk of cancer between two dialysis groups by using the HD patients as the reference group. The result showed that there is no significant different for each cancer risk between two dialysis groups. In conclusion, dialysis patients had a higher risk of certain types of cancer than those in the nonuremia group. However, there was no significant difference in the cancer risk between the two dialysis groups when compared directly."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Obesity is a chronic disease that is increasingly prevalent around the world and is a well-recognized risk factor for type 2 diabetes and hypertension, leading causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The obese diabetic patient with ESRD is a challenge for the nephrologist with regard to the type of renal replacement therapy that should be suggested and offered to the patient. There is no evidence that either peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis is contraindicated in obese ESRD patients. In the literature, we can find a discrepancy in the impact of obesity on mortality among hemodialysis vs. peritoneal dialysis patients. Several studies in hemodialysis patients suggest that a higher BMI confers a survival advantage - the so-called \"reverse epidemiology\". In contrast, the literature among obese peritoneal dialysis patients is inconsistent, with various studies reporting an increased risk of death, no difference, or a decreased risk of death. Many of these studies only spanned across a few years, and this is probably too short of a time frame for a realistic assessment of obesity's impact on mortality in ESRD patients. The decision for dialysis modality in an obese diabetic patient with ESRD should be individualized. According to the results of published studies, we cannot suggest PD or HD as a better solution for all obese diabetic patients. The obese patient should be educated about all their dialysis options, including home dialysis therapies. In this review, the available literature related to the dialysis modality in obese patients with diabetes and ESRD was reviewed. "

    "content": "Data on cardiac arrhythmia and electrolyte changes during the dialysis cycle have been limited. Fifty-two hemodialysis (HD) patients underwent 48-h Holter monitoring during early-week and mid-week HD sessions. Pre-HD and post-HD blood samples were collected in both HD sessions. The 48-h Holter data were divided into five phases: (1) 4-h during the early-week HD (HD1), (2) 12-h post-HD1, (3) 16-h period between Phases 2 and 4 (used as the patient's baseline electrocardiography [ECG]), (4) 12-h pre-HD2 phase, and (5) 4-h during the mid-week HD (HD2). The patients' mean age was 68.54\u2009\u00b1\u200913.37\u2009years. We found that the dialysate-to-serum[K] gradient and changes of S[K] were significantly higher in HD1 than in HD2, as well as changes of S[Mg]. There were no significant ECG changes during the 4-h HD1 and HD2 when compared with the baseline ECG. Phase 2 of Holter ECG was the most common phase that showed significant changes (increased QT interval dispersion (QTD), increased ventricular events, increased number of premature ventricular contractions, ST elevation and ST depression), which was contributed from the dialysate[K] 2\u2009mmol/L subgroup, but not the dialysate[K] 3\u2009mmol/L subgroup. In the subgroup of patients with a high ultrafiltration rate (UFR; mean UFR \u226510\u00a0mL/kg/h), there were significantly increased ventricular events and ST-segment changes in Phase 2. In conclusion, ECG changes were associated with the dialysis cycle, significantly in the 12-h after early-week HD sessions. These may be associated with low dialysate[K] or high dialysate-to-S[K] gradient, high ultrafiltration rate and duration of the interdialytic interval."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Patients with chronic renal failure are commonly cared using a blood filtration mechanism like hemodialysis. Little information is available regarding ocular changes following hemodialysis for people with chronic renal failure. Accordingly, this study intended to estimate the pre- and post-hemodialysis thickness of retina and choroid and other ocular findings in patients with chronic renal failure.This research is a \"before and after\" clinical experiment, without control. This prospective study was conducted on patients with chronic renal failure who were in Imam Khomeini Hospital for hemodialysis in 2017. The sample size of this study was estimated to be 67 (134 eyes). In this study, after acquiring consent (by the associated assistant) from all patients, thorough ocular examinations including IOP control, VA and fundus examination, reflection, and macula and choroid OCT were performed 30\u00a0min before and after hemodialysis and entered in SPSS V. 16 software by the project manager. Finally, these data were analyzed practicing T-pair tests or their nonparametric equivalent, the Wilcoxon test.Based on the results of this examination, studying 67 participating patients, 134 eyes were examined, of which 80 eyes (59.8%) belonged to men, and 54 eyes (40.2%) belonged to women. The mean and standard deviation of participants' age in the study was reported to be 57.3\u2009\u00b1\u200915\u00a0years, and the dialysis duration was 3.0\u2009\u00b1\u20092.11\u00a0h. According to the Wilcoxon test, the average rank in terms of weight, patient temperature, pulse, blood sugar, urea, potassium, ocular pressure, 500-micron nasal choroidal thickness, and myopia in diopter vary significantly before and after dialysis (p\u2009<\u20090.05). However, according to the Wilcoxon test, choroidal thickness in the subfoveal area of the eye (p\u2009=\u20090.600), the retinal thickness in the subfoveal area (p\u2009=\u20090.839), the amount of astigmatism in diopter (p\u2009=\u20090.757) and the amount of hypermetropia in diopter (p\u2009=\u20090.068) before and after dialysis do not have a significant difference. Based on the t test, it was reported that the average creatinine score, the best corrected vision, and the 500 and 1000-micron temporal and nasal choroidal thickness had a significant difference (p\u2009<\u20090.05).Based on the results of the current study, it was settled that the corrected vision, ocular pressure, as well as the 500-micron nasal choroidal thickness, and myopia in diopter and the 1000-micron temporal and nasal choroidal thickness of patients before and after hemodialysis vary. This difference shows the impact of hemodialysis on changes in ocular characteristics in patients with renal insufficiency."

    "content": "To describe the impact of a novel communication and triage pathway called fast track dialysis (FTD) on the length of stay (LOS), resource utilization, and charges for unscheduled hemodialysis for end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients presenting to the emergency department (ED).Prospective and retrospective cohorts of ESRD patients meeting requirements of routine or urgent hemodialysis at a tertiary academic hospital from September 25th, 2016 to September 25th, 2018 in 1 year cohorts. Two sample t-tests were used to compare most outcomes of the cohorts with a Mann-Whitney U test used for skewed data. Nephrology group outcomes were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis and chi-square tests.There were 98 encounters in the historical cohort and 143 encounters in the fast track dialysis cohort. FTD had significantly lowered median ED LOS (4.05\u00a0h, vs 5.3\u00a0h, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), median hospital LOS (12.8\u00a0h vs 27\u00a0h, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), time to hemodialysis (4.78\u00a0h vs 7.29\u00a0h, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and median hospital charges ($26,040 vs $30,747, p\u00a0<\u00a00.016). The FTD cohort had increased 30 day ED return for each encounter compared to the historical cohort (1.85 visits vs 0.73 visits, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), however no significant increase in 1\u00a0year ED visits (6.52 visits vs 5.80, p\u00a0=\u00a00.4589) or 1 year readmissions (5.89 readmissions vs 4.81 readmissions, p\u00a0=\u00a00.3584). Most nephrology groups had significantly lower time to hemodialysis order placement and time to start hemodialysis.A multidisciplinary approach with key stakeholders using a standard pathway can lead to improved efficiency in throughput, reduced charges, and hospital resource utilization for patients needing urgent or routine hemodialysis. A study with a dedicated geographic observation unit for protocolized short stay patients including conditions ranging from low risk chest pain to transient ischemic events that incorporates FTD patients under this protocol should be considered."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Booster influenza vaccination has been recommended for patients with chronic renal disease in order to enhance the immune response to the influenza vaccine; however, the efficacy of a booster influenza vaccination is a matter of controversy. Therefore, we made a meta-analysis to determine the efficacy in patients with hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD) and renal transplant recipient (RT). The sero-protection rate was used as a serologic parameter to describe the immune response to the vaccine. Statistical analysis was performed to calculate the pooled rate difference (RD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). The pooled RD for the H1N1, H3N2 and B influenza vaccines was 0.02 (95% CI: -0.02-0.06), 0.05 (95% CI: -0.01-0.11), 0.04 (95% CI: -0.02-0.10), respectively. We concluded that a booster dose of the influenza vaccine did not effectively enhance immunogenicity. Therefore, a booster dose of vaccine is not recommended for patients with hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and renal transplant recipients."

The aim of this study was to detect the intra-patient variability of blood single pool Kt/V as measured from pre-post dialysis blood urea and from the online tool Adimea<sup>\u00ae</sup>, which measures the ultraviolet absorbance of spent dialyzate.This open, one-armed, prospective non-interventional study, evaluates patients on bicarbonate hemodialysis or/and on hemodiafiltration. Dialysis was performed with B. Braun Dialog+ machines equipped with Adimea<sup>\u00ae</sup>. In the course of the prospective observation, online monitoring with Adimea<sup>\u00ae</sup> in each session was established without the target warning function being activated. A sample size of 97 patients was estimated.A total of 120 patients were enrolled in six centers in China (mean age 51.5 \u00b1 12.2 years, 86.7% males, 24.2% diabetics). All had an AV-fistula. The proportion of patients with blood Kt/V < 1.20 at baseline was 48.3%. During follow-up with Adimea<sup>\u00ae</sup>, the subgroup with Kt/V > 1.20 at baseline remains at the same adequacy level for more than 90% of the patients. Those with a Kt/V < 1.20 at baseline, showed a significant increase of Kt/V to 60% of the patients reaching the adequacy level >1.20. The coefficient of variation for spKt/V as evaluated by Adimea<sup>\u00ae</sup> was 9.6 \u00b1 3.4%, not significantly different from the 9.6 \u00b1 8.6% as blood Kt/V taken at the same time.Online monitoring of dialysis dose by Adimea<sup>\u00ae</sup> improves and maintains dialysis adequacy. Implementing online monitoring by Adimea into daily practice moves the quality of dialysis patient care a significant step forward."

This study aimed to investigate the one-year outcomes of prophylactic hemodialysis against standard treatment in patients with CKD who underwent coronary angiography.A cohort study of 359 patients with CKD, coronary artery disease (CAD), and serum creatinine levels of 176.8-530.4\u00a0\u03bcmol/L, who were referred for elective coronary angiography was conducted. Propensity score matching identified 118 patient pairs for outcome comparisons. The hemodialysis group underwent prophylactic hemodialysis after coronary angiography, whereas the control group received standard treatment. The study's primary outcome was free from dialysis was considered the primary outcome, whereas the secondary outcome was overall survival. Unadjusted estimates of the probability of free from dialysis and overall survival were computed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests. Cox proportional-hazards regression models were used in determining the risk factors associated with ESRD and mortality.During a mean 9.3 months follow-up duration, the hemodialysis group had significantly better free from dialysis (85.6% vs. 64.4%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and overall survival (85.4% vs. 78.5%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.008) rates than the control group. Cox proportional-hazards regression analyses of the propensity score-matched patients showed that the hemodialysis group had reduced risks for ESRD and mortality (hazard ratios, 0.32 and 0.48, respectively).Prophylactic Hemodialysis following coronary angiography was associated with reduced ESRD and mortality risks in CKD patients with CAD, who did not routinely undergo dialysis."

    "content": "Adrenal insufficiency in hemodialysis patients is commonly encountered in clinical practice. However, its association with end-stage renal disease is unclear. We investigated the relationship between adrenal function and relevant clinical parameters, focusing on dialysis vintage.Altogether, 100 maintenance hemodialysis patients were enrolled (age: 69.8\u2009\u00b1\u200911.8\u00a0years, dialysis vintage: 9.4\u2009\u00b1\u20099.2\u00a0years). Basal serum cortisol levels were measured and their associations with relevant clinical parameters were investigated. Subsequently, hormone stimulation tests were performed to assess adrenal function.Basal serum cortisol significantly decreased with an increase in dialysis vintage (<\u200910\u00a0years, 11.9\u2009\u00b1\u20093.7\u00a0\u03bcg/dL; 10-19\u00a0years, 10.9\u2009\u00b1\u20092.9\u00a0\u03bcg/dL;\u2009\u2265\u200920\u00a0years, 9.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.8\u00a0\u03bcg/dL). Basal cortisol was negatively correlated with dry weight, \u03b22-microglobulin, creatinine, and lymphocyte count and positively correlated with brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity. Significant negative correlations were observed between basal cortisol and dialysis vintage after adjusting for confounding variables in the multivariate analysis. Standard adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation tests were performed in 17 patients. Seven patients were diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency and all of them had a long dialysis vintage (\u2265\u200910\u00a0years). According to the rapid ACTH test, cortisol responses were significantly decreased in patients with long dialysis vintage compared to those with short dialysis vintage (<\u200910\u00a0years). Similar findings were observed in ten patients without adrenal insufficiency. The CRH loading test showed similar tendencies, although the differences were not statistically significant.Adrenal function decreased with an increase in dialysis vintage. Long-term dialysis patients might be susceptible to adrenal insufficiency."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA) is characterized by the deposition of amyloid consisting of beta2-microglobulin in the musculoskeletal system, causing carpal tunnel syndrome, destructive spondyloarthropathy, and/or bone cysts. Increased cystic radiolucency of the bones and tendon thickening due to inflammation are common findings in DRA. We have developed a new dialysis method, extended-hours hemodialysis without dietary restrictions for the aim of improving both hypertension and malnutrition. We retrospectively evaluated the clinical effects of dialysis time on the risk for developing of DRA. The study subjects were all of the 30 patients who had received this treatment for more than 11 years. They were divided into two groups according to the weekly dialysis hours: 15 patients \u2265 16.5 hours/week (L-group) and 15 patients \u2264 15.5 hours/week (S-group). Plain x-ray imaging and ultrasonography were used to assess cystic radiolucency of the bones and thickness/diameter of the soft tissues. The proportion of the carpal bone cystic radiolucency was lower in the L-group. The severity of median nerve compression at the wrist was significantly less in the L-group (right hand: p = 0.0082, left hand: p = 0.0137). Multivariate regression analysis showed that dialysis time was a predictor of median nerve compression (\u03b2 = -0.559, p = 0.005). In conclusion, extended-hours hemodialysis without dietary restrictions contributes to lower the risk for developing of DRA at the wrist. We therefore propose that extended-hours hemodialysis without dietary restrictions is a preferred method which maintains the patients' quality of life compared with the conventional hemodialysis method."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Ambulatory pulse-wave velocity (PWV), augmentation pressure, and augmentation index (AIx) are associated with increased cardiovascular events and death in hemodialysis. The intermittent nature of hemodialysis generates a distinct ambulatory pattern, with a progressive increase of augmentation pressure and AIx during the interdialytic interval. No study so far has compared the ambulatory course of central hemodynamics and PWV between peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis patients.Thirty-eight patients under peritoneal dialysis and 76 patients under hemodialysis matched in a 1\u200a:\u200a2 ratio for age, sex and dialysis vintage underwent 48-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring with the oscillometric Mobil-O-Graph device. Parameters of central hemodynamics [central SBP, DBP and pulse pressure (PP)], wave reflection [AIx, heart rate-adjusted AIx; AIx(75) and augmentation pressure] and PWV were estimated from the 48-h recordings.Over the total 48-h period, no significant differences were observed between peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis patients in mean levels of central SBP, DBP, PP, augmentation pressure, AIx, AIx(75) and PWV. However, patients under peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis displayed different trajectories in all the above parameters over the course of the recording: in peritoneal dialysis patients no differences were noted in central SBP (125.0\u200a\u00b1\u200a19.2 vs. 126.0\u200a\u00b1\u200a17.8\u200ammHg, P\u200a=\u200a0.25), DBP, PP, augmentation pressure (13.0\u200a\u00b1\u200a6.8 vs. 13.7\u200a\u00b1\u200a7.\u200ammHg, P\u200a=\u200a0.15), AIx(75) (25.9\u200a\u00b1\u200a6.9 vs. 26.3\u200a\u00b1\u200a7.8%, P\u200a=\u200a0.54) and PWV (9.5\u200a\u00b1\u200a2.1 vs. 9.6\u200a\u00b1\u200a2.1\u200am/s, P\u200a=\u200a0.27) from the first to the second 24-h period of the recording. In contrast, hemodialysis patients showed significant increases in all these parameters from the first to second 24 h (SBP: 119.5\u200a\u00b1\u200a14.4 vs. 124.6\u200a\u00b1\u200a15.0\u200ammHg, P\u200a<\u200a0.001; augmentation pressure: 10.9\u200a\u00b1\u200a5.3 vs. 13.1\u200a\u00b1\u200a6.3\u200ammHg, P\u200a<\u200a0.001; AIx(75): 24.7\u200a\u00b1\u200a7.6 vs. 27.4\u200a\u00b1\u200a7.9%, P\u200a<\u200a0.001; PWV: 9.1\u200a\u00b1\u200a1.8 vs. 9.3\u200a\u00b1\u200a1.8\u200am/s, P\u200a<\u200a0.001). Peritoneal dialysis patients had numerically higher levels than hemodialysis patients in all the above parameters during all periods studied and especially during the first 24-h.Central BP, wave reflection indices and PWV during a 48-h recording are steady in peritoneal dialysis but gradually increase in hemodialysis patients. During all studied periods, peritoneal dialysis patients have numerically higher levels of all studied parameters, a fact that could relate to higher cardiovascular risk."

This study aims to evaluate the effect of hemodialysis on the diagnosis of depression among patients on maintenance hemodialysis as dialysis diminishes the uremic symptoms, and to compare depression scores before and after dialysis.This was a cross-sectional analytic study conducted from November 2018 through April 2019, in three tertiary hospitals. Consenting participants aged 18\u2009years or older, who had received hemodialysis for at least three months were included. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) tool was used to collect patients' data and to identify symptoms of depression Pre- and post-hemodialysis. Depression scores were compared using the paired sample Wilcoxon rank test or the McNemar test, where appropriate.Overall, 163 participants were enrolled in the study. The average age of the participants was 56.5\u2009years old, whereas 44.8% were females. The prevalence of depressive symptoms before hemodialysis was 48.5%, with prevalence of mild, moderate and moderately severe of 34.4%, 11.7% and 2.5%, respectively. On the other hand, the prevalence of depressive symptoms after hemodialysis was 46.6% with 36.8%, 9.2% and 0.6% of the participants reporting mild, moderate and moderately severe symptoms, respectively. We found no significant difference in depression scores before and after dialysis (p-values\u2009>\u20090.05).Our study supports the fact that the prevalence of depression is high among patients with ESRD on maintenance hemodialysis. We didn't find a significant difference in depression scores among hemodialysis patients before and after dialysis, with negligible effect of uremic symptoms on the diagnosis of depression. We suggest adopting routine screening of depression among this high-risk group of patients."

In both groups, Psc increased significantly, with no difference between the two groups-pre-dialysis (continuous PD 40\u2009\u00b1\u200917.4, 42.8\u2009\u00b1\u200917.2, 48\u2009\u00b1\u200919; HD 39.1\u2009\u00b1\u200921.3, 39. 5\u2009\u00b1\u200918.9, 45.2\u2009\u00b1\u200921) and post-dialysis (continuous PD 42.8\u2009\u00b1\u20097.2, 48\u2009\u00b1\u200919, 57.1\u2009\u00b1\u200918.3; HD 42\u2009\u00b1\u200919, 45\u2009\u00b1\u200918.5, 56\u2009\u00b1\u200924.8). Rsr remained stable among patients on continuous PD (pre-dialysis 10.4\u2009\u00b1\u20095.1, 13.3\u2009\u00b1\u20097.7, 13.5\u2009\u00b1\u200910.3, post-dialysis 13.3\u2009\u00b1\u20097.7, 13.5\u2009\u00b1\u200910.3, 11.1\u2009\u00b1\u20095.9) and decreased among HD patients (pre-dialysis 10.4\u2009\u00b1\u20095.1, 10.4\u2009\u00b1\u20095.1, 10.4\u2009\u00b1\u20095, 1, post-dialysis 10.5\u2009\u00b1\u20096.8, 10\u2009\u00b1\u20094.9, 8.9\u2009\u00b1\u20094.2). There was difference in Rsr between the two groups at the post-dialysis moments 1 and 2 (p\u2009=\u20090.03). OI increased in both groups (continuous PD 260.7\u2009\u00b1\u2009119, 252.7\u2009\u00b1\u200987.1, 287.3\u2009\u00b1\u200988.4; HD 228\u2009\u00b1\u200985, 257\u2009\u00b1\u200984, 312.1\u2009\u00b1\u2009111.5, p\u2009>\u20090.05), although there was no difference between them.AKI patients undergoing IMV and HD or PD had improvement in the mechanical ventilation and oxygenation, with no difference between the two groups."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "The dialysis dose (Kt/V) and normalized protein catabolic rate (PCRn) are the most useful indices derived from the urea kinetic model (UKM) in haemodialysis (HD) patients. The kidney urea clearance (Kru) is another important UKM parameter which plays a key role in the prescription of incremental HD. Ideally, the three kinetic parameters should be assessed using the complex software Solute Solver based on the double pool UKM. In the clinical setting, however, the three indices are estimated with simplified formulae. The recently introduced software SPEEDY assembles the aforementioned equations in a plain spreadsheet, to produce quite accurate results of Kru, Kt/V and PCRn. Unfortunately, specific equations to compute Kt/V and PCRn for patients on a once-weekly HD regimen (1HD/wk) were not available at the time SPEEDY was built-up. We devised a new version of SPEEDY (SPEEDY-1) and an even simpler variant (SPEEDY-1S), using two recently published equations for the 1HD/wk schedule . Moreover, we also added a published equation to estimate the equivalent renal clearance (EKR) normalized to urea distribution volume (V) of 35 L (EKR<sub>35</sub>) from Kru and Kt/V . Aim of the present study was to compare the results obtained using the new methods (SPEEDY-1 and SPEEDY-1S) with those provided by the reference method Solute Solver.One hundred historical patients being treated with the once-weekly HD regimen were enrolled. A total of 500 HD sessions associated to the availability of monthly UKM studies were analysed in order to obtain Kru, single pool Kt/V (spKt/V), equilibrated Kt/V (eKt/V), V, PCRn and EKR<sub>35</sub> values by using Solute Solver, SPEEDY-1 and SPEEDY-1S.When comparing the paired values of the above UKM parameters, as computed by SPEEDY-1 and Solute Solver, respectively, all differences but one were statistically significant at the one-sample t-test; however, the agreement limits at Bland-Altman analysis showed that all differences were negligible. When comparing the paired values of the above UKM parameters, as computed by SPEEDY-1S and Solute Solver, respectively, all differences were statistically significant; however, the agreement limits showed that the differences were negligible as far as Kru, spKt/V and eKt/V are concerned, though much larger regarding V, PCRn and EKR<sub>35</sub>.We implemented SPEEDY with a new version specific for the once-weekly HD regimen, SPEEDY-1. It provides accurate results and is presently\u00a0the best alternative to Solute Solver. Using SPEEDY-1S led to a larger difference in PCRn and EKR<sub>35</sub>, which could be acceptable for clinical practice if SPEEDY-1 is not available."

This study investigates the mortality rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the factors affecting mortality among patients who were on maintenance hemodialysis and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.A total of 200 patients, including 157 maintenance hemodialysis and 43 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients followed in our hospital, were included in the study. The patients' sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, history of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the previous year, death event, source of death (SARS-CoV-2 or not), presence of hospitalization due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, need for intensive care unit, need for ventilatory support in intensive care unit were obtained from the clinical file records.85 of the 200 patients had a history of SARS-Cov-2 infection during the last 12\u00a0months. Forty-two (49.5%) patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were hospitalized. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 had longer dialysis time, increased mortality, and significantly higher comorbidities such as coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure. Besides, heart failure and hypertension were the determining factors in the risk factor analysis for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In dialysis patients, the mortality rate in the last year, due to all causes, including SARS-CoV-2 infection, was 23% while the mortality rate due to \"SARS-CoV-2 infection only\" was 13%) (p > 0.05). Our findings are important in guiding clinical decision-making and informing the public and health authorities about the risk of death associated with COVID-19 in this patient group."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Despite several studies reporting similar outcomes for peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD), the former is underused worldwide, with a PD prevalence of 15% in Italy. In 2008, the Unit of Nephrology and Dialysis of the Healthcare Trust of the Autonomous Province of Trento implemented a successful PD program which has increased the proportion of PD incident patients from 7 to 47%. We aimed to assess the effect of this extensive use of PD by comparing HD and PD in terms of survival and time-to-transplantation.A total of 334 HD and 153 PD incident patients were enrolled between January 2008 and December 2014. After screening for exclusion criteria and propensity score matching, 279 HD and 132 PD patients were analyzed. Survival and time-to-transplantation were assessed by competing-risks regression models, using death and transplantation as primary and competing events.Crude and adjusted regression models for survival revealed the absence of significant differences between HD and PD cumulative incidence functions (subhazard ratio: 1.09, p\u2009=\u20090.62 and 1.34, p\u2009=\u20090.10, respectively). Differently, crude and adjusted regression models for transplantation revealed a lower time-to-transplantation for PD versus HD patients (subhazard ratio: 2.34, p\u2009<\u20090.01, and 2.57, p\u2009<\u20090.01, respectively). The waiting time for placement in the transplant waiting list was longer in HD than PD patients (330 vs. 224 days, p\u2009<\u20090.01).The extensive use of PD did not lead to any statistically significant difference in mortality. Furthermore, PD was associated with lower time to transplantation. PD may be a viable option for large-scale dialytic treatment in the advanced chronic kidney disease population."

    "content": "In patients who receive chronic hemodialysis but do not have autogenous venous conduit for a native dialysis access, nonautologous grafts serve as an alternative conduit of choice. This study compared the clinical outcome of hemodialysis access using bovine carotid artery graft (BCAG) and prosthetic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft in patients who receive chronic hemodialysis.An analysis of all patients undergoing hemodialysis using either BCAG or PTFE grafts from 2010 to 2017 was performed. Clinical outcomes were analyzed including graft patency as well as associated complications related to dialysis grafts and tunneled dialysis catheter (TDC).During the study period, 142 patients received BCAG and 128 patients received PTFE graft implantation for dialysis access. The mean duration from graft implantation to graft cannulation in the BCAG and PTFE group was 12.3 \u00b1 8.5 days versus 43.5 \u00b1 16.4, respectively ( P = .01). Bovine carotid artery graft group had a higher 2-year primary patency rate (33% vs 14%, P = .03) and assisted primary rate (57% vs 23%, P = .02) compared to the PTFE group. The 2-year secondary patency rates were similar between the 2 groups (56% vs 53%, P = .69). Complication rates in the BCAG and PTFE group was 1.69 \u00b1 0.24 per patient-year versus 2.54 \u00b1 0.48 per patient-year, respectively ( P = .01). Tunneled dialysis catheter-related infection was greater in the PTFE group compared to the BCAG group (10.87 \u00b1 2.61 vs 5.69 \u00b1 0.98 per 1000 TDC days; P = .02). Bovine carotid artery graft cohorts group required a mean of 1.69 interventions per patient-year, compared to 2.76 per patient-year for the PTFE group ( P = .03).Bovine carotid artery graft permits earlier cannulation for hemodialysis access with superior primary and assisted primary patency rates compared to PTFE grafts. Patients with BCAG experienced shorter indwelling TDC duration and less TDC-related complications compared to PTFE cohorts."

Age, sex, amount of time spent on dialysis, and laboratory data were recorded. Impact of fibromyalgia on QoL was evaluated using the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), while depressive symptoms and anxiety level were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), respectively.The point prevalence of fibromyalgia was 14% in Group 1 (n=15), 5.9% in Group 2 (n=3), 9.6% in Group 3 (n=5), and 4% in Group 4. There was a significant difference in the point prevalence of fibromyalgia between the hemodialysis group and healthy controls (p<0.05). The median FIQ scores were significantly higher in all patient groups than Group 4 (p<0.001); however, there was no significant difference between the patient groups (p>0.05). The median BDI scores were significantly higher in Group 1 and Group 2 than Group 4 (p<0.05). The median BAI scores were significantly higher in Group 1 than Group 4 (p<0.05). When the patients with and without fibromyalgia were compared, FIQ and BAI in Group 1, BAI in Group 2, and FIQ in Group 3 significantly differed (p<0.05). There was no relationship between fibromyalgia and any of the laboratory data, age, or time spent on dialysis (p>0.05).Fibromyalgia is significantly more common among hemodialysis patients than healthy individuals with a similar prevalence to the healthy individuals for peritoneal dialysis and renal transplant patients. The presence of fibromyalgia is related to depressive symptoms, anxiety, and higher impact on QoL for patients with chronic kidney disease."

We compared HRQoL between conventional in-centre HD and home-based PD in 1082 newly diagnosed kidney failure patients.This was an open-label, randomised, non-inferiority trial of adult patients with a diagnosis of end-stage kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate \u2264 15 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) requiring maintenance dialysis from 36 sites in China randomised 1:1 to receive PD or conventional in-centre HD. The primary outcome was the 'Burden of Kidney Disease' assessed using the Kidney Disease Quality of Life-Short Form (KDQoL-SF) survey over 48 weeks and the main secondary outcomes were the remaining scales of KDQoL-SF and all-cause mortality. The effect of PD versus HD on the primary outcome was compared by their geometric mean (GM) ratio, and non-inferiority was defined by the lower bound of a one-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) >0.9.A total of 725 subjects completed the trial per protocol (395 PD and 330 HD, mean age 49.8 (standard deviation (SD) 14.4) years, 41.4% women). For the primary outcome, the mean (SD) change in 'Burden of Kidney Disease' over 48 weeks was 2.61 (1.27) in PD group and 2.58 (1.35) in HD group, and the GM ratio (95% CI) was 1.059 (0.908-1.234), exceeding the limit for non-inferiority. For the secondary outcomes, the PD and HD groups were similar in all scales. There were 17 and 31 deaths in PD and HD groups, respectively. Patients receiving PD had more adverse events, adverse event leading to hospitalisation and serious adverse events compared to those allocated to HD, but adverse events leading to death and discontinuation of the trial were not different between PD and HD.In this trial, PD may be non-inferior to HD on the 'Burden of Kidney Disease' among Chinese kidney failure patients who are of younger age and have lower comorbidity after 48 weeks' follow-up."

The initiative included a new modality-based funding formula, a standard mandatory informatics system, targets for prevalent home dialysis rates, the development of a 'network' of renal programmes with commitment to home dialysis and a culture of accountability with frequent meetings between ORN and each renal programme leadership to review their results. It also included funding of home dialysis coordinators, encouragement and funding of assisted peritoneal dialysis (PD), and support for catheter insertion and urgent start PD. Between 2012 and 2017, home dialysis use rose from 21.9% to 26.5% and then between 2017 and 2019 stabilised at 26% to 26.5%. Over 7 years, the absolute number of people on home dialysis increased 40% from 2222 to 3105, while the number on facility haemodialysis grew 11% from 7935 to 8767. PD prevalence rose from 16.6% to 20.9%, a relative increase of 25%. The initiative showed that a sustained multifaceted approach can increase home dialysis utilisation."

Molidustat is a novel hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitor that stimulates erythropoietin production, predominately in the kidney. We report methodological details of three phase III trials, named MolIdustat once dailY improves renal Anaemia By Inducing erythropoietin (MIYABI), designed primarily to investigate the efficacy of molidustat therapy in adults with renal anaemia and dialysis-dependent CKD.MIYABI Haemodialysis-Correction (HD-C) is a single-arm trial (24-week treatment duration) in approximately 25 patients on haemodialysis, currently untreated with ESAs. MIYABI Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) is a single-arm trial (36\u2009week treatment duration) in approximately 50 patients on peritoneal dialysis, treated or untreated with ESAs. MIYABI Haemodialysis-Maintenance (HD-M) is a randomised, active-controlled, double-blinded, double-dummy trial (52-week treatment duration) comparing molidustat with darbepoetin alfa in approximately 225 patients on haemodialysis, treated with ESAs. Molidustat (starting dose 75\u2009mg/day) will be titrated 4-weekly to maintain haemoglobin in predetermined target ranges. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of molidustat, using the following measures: the rate of rise in haemoglobin (g/L/week) at the first dose change up to week 8 (MIYABI HD-C); responder rate (MIYABI HD-C and MIYABI PD); mean haemoglobin level during weeks 33-36 and non-inferiority to darbepoetin alfa shown by change in mean haemoglobin level from baseline (MIYABI HD-M). The secondary objectives are to assess safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. These trials will provide the first evaluations of molidustat therapy in patients receiving either peritoneal dialysis or currently untreated with ESAs on haemodialysis, and provide further evidence in patients treated with ESAs on haemodialysis.The protocols were approved by ethics committees at all participating sites. The trials will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. Results arising from these studies will be published in peer-reviewed journal(s).NCT03351166; Pre-results, NCT03418168; Pre-results, NCT03543657; Pre-results."

Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous parasite that causes severe manifestations in immunocompromised patients. This case-control study was conducted to the immunodiagnosis and molecular validation of T. gondii infection among patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing haemodialysis. The study population consisted of 260 haemodialysis patients and 259 healthy controls referred to the main dialysis centres of Tehran, Iran during 2016. Anti-T. gondii immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. As well, the T. gondii genomic DNA in whole blood samples of IgM-positive patients and healthy controls was evaluated using GRA6-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and SAG1-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays. The anti-T. gondii IgG and IgM antibodies were detected in 175 (67.3%) and 18 (7%) of haemodialysis patients and 122 (47%) and 4 (1.5%) of controls, respectively. Two of the 18 blood samples from IgM-positive patients and none of the IgM-positive control subjects were positive by GRA6-PCR. Whereas, nine and two blood samples of IgM-positive patients and controls were positive for Toxoplasma DNA by a SAG1-LAMP technique respectively. The seropositivity of the Toxoplasma IgM antibody was significantly different between haemodialysis patients and healthy controls which was confirmed by PCR and LAMP. The higher prevalence of T. gondii infection in haemodialysis patients compared with the controls proposes that these patients can be a group at risk for toxoplasmosis and screening for toxoplasmosis before dialysis is necessary for the patients."

However, sometimes terminology used is interpreted differently by different stakeholders, which might lead to confusion during shared decision making. The construct dialysis adequacy is frequently used, suggesting it is an important outcome both for health care professionals as for patients.To assess the scope and consistency of the construct dialysis adequacy as reported in randomised controlled trials in hemodialysis, and evaluate whether these align to the insights and understanding of this construct by patients.To assess scope and consistency of dialysis adequacy by professionals, we performed a systematic review searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to July 2017. We identified all randomised controlled trails (RCT) including patients on hemodialysis and reporting dialysis adequacy, adequacy or adequacy of dialysis and extracted and classified all reported outcomes. To explore interpretation and meaning of the construct of adequacy by patients, we conducted 11 semi-structured interviews with HD patients using thematic analysis. Belgian registration number B670201731001.From the 31 included trials, we extracted and classified 98 outcome measures defined by the authors as adequacy of dialysis, of which 94 (95%) were biochemical, 3 (3%) non-biochemical surrogate and 2 (2%) patient-relevant. The three most commonly reported measures were all biochemical. None of the studies defined adequacy of dialysis as a patient relevant outcome such as survival or quality of life. Patients had a substantially different understanding of the construct dialysis adequacy than the biochemical interpretation reported in the literature. Being alive, time spent while being on dialysis, fatigue and friendliness of staff were the most prominent themes that patients linked to the construct of dialysis adequacy.Adequacy of dialysis as reported in the literature refers to biochemical outcome measures, most of which are not related with patient relevant outcomes. For patients, adequate dialysis is a dialysis that enables them to spend as much quality time in their life as possible."

We aimed to evaluate the differences in the efficacy of anticoagulation procedures using the venous port and 40\u2009mg enoxaparin in HDx compared to high-flux hemodialysis (HF-HD) and postdilution online hemodiafiltration (HDF). We compared anticoagulant activity in 11 patients in HDx, HF-HD, and HDF under similar dialysis conditions. In the 33 dialysis sessions, 40\u2009mg enoxaparin was administered through the venous port, and pre- and postdialysis antifactor Xa activity (aXa) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), postdialysis clotting time of the vascular access, visual clotting score of the dialyzer, and any complications with the extracorporeal circuit or bleeding were registered. APTT postdialysis in HDx was not significantly different from that in HF-HD and HDF. Postdialysis aXa in HDx was not significantly different from that in HF-HD and HDF. We found no significant differences in visual clotting score of the dialyzer. Enoxaparin administered through the venous port was sufficient for anticoagulation within the extracorporeal circuit in HDx, HF-HD, and HDF. There were no differences in postdialysis aXa or APTT, most likely because when low molecular-weight heparin is applied through venous port, lesser enoxaparin concentration reaches the dialyzer. Thus, we conclude that the dose of enoxaparin administered through the venous port should not be adjusted according to dialysis technique."

There was significant relation with period of dialysis before transplantation and biopsy proved rejection (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008, <0.001, respectively).Hearing impairment is a common finding in ESRD patients. Thus audiological assessment must be done in these patients."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Renal replacement therapy in India is predominantly a private health-care-driven initiative making it an expensive treatment option due to high out-of-pocket expenditures. Moreover, with the rapid increase in the number of chronic kidney disease patients requiring dialysis, hemodialysis units (HDUs) are getting saturated. Community \"stand-alone\" dialysis centers could be an important alternative to HDUs in meeting the growing demand in an affordable model. The aim of this study was to find hemodialysis (HD) delivery in \"stand-alone\" dialysis units (SAUs) with respect to expanding coverage, patient costs, and patient safety safeguards. The total number of HD sessions was collected at three points. The information regarding patient safety safeguards at SAUs and impact of SAUs on patient costs were collected by interviews and from hospital records. There was 11.5 times increase in HD sessions from 2008 to 2017, out of which 75.3% was provided at SAUs. Following objective clinical and safety measures, high-quality dialysis was delivered at SAUs and it significantly reduced the mean patient cost of treatment per session."

    "content": "Hemodialysis is the main approach for renal replacement therapy in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in China. The timing of dialysis initiation is one of the key factors influencing patient survival and prognosis. Over the past decade, the relationship between the timing of dialysis initiation and mortality has remained unclear in patients with ESRD in China.Patients who commenced maintenance hemodialysis from 2009 to 2014 from 24 hemodialysis centers in Mainland China were enrolled in the study (n = 1,674). Patients were divided into 2 groups based on the year they started hemodialysis (patients who started hemodialysis from 2009 to 2011, and patients who started hemodialysis from 2012 to 2014). Analysis of the yearly change in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at the initiation of dialysis was performed for the 2 groups. Meanwhile, the patients were divided into 3 groups based on their eGFR at the initiation of dialysis (<4, 4-8, and >8 mL/min/1.73 m2). For these 3 groups, the relationship between the eGFR at the start of dialysis and mortality were analyzed.The average eGFRs were 5.68 and 5.94 mL/min/1.73 m2 for 2009-2011 and 2012-2014, respectively. Compared with the 2009-2011 group, the proportion of patients with diabetes in 2012-2014 increased from 26.7 to 37.7%. The prognosis of patients with different eGFRs at the start of dialysis was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. After adjusting for confounding factors through a Cox regression model, no significant difference was demonstrated among the 3 groups (<4 mL/min/1.73 m2 was used as the reference, in comparison with 4-8 mL/min/1.73 m2 [p = 0.681] and >8 mL/min/1.73 m2 [p = 0.403]).In Mainland China, the eGFR at the start of dialysis did not change significantly over time from 2008 to 2014 and had no association with the mortality of patients with ESRD."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Among kidney disease patients \u226580 years progressing to end-stage renal disease, there is growing interest in conservative nondialytic management approaches. However, among those who have initiated hemodialysis, little is known about the impact of withdrawal from dialysis on mortality, nor the patient characteristics associated with withdrawal from dialysis.Historical cohort study.We examined 133,162 incident hemodialysis patients receiving care within a large national dialysis organization from 2007 to\u00a02011.We identified patients who withdrew from dialysis, either as a listed cause of death or censor reason. Incidence rates and subdistribution hazard ratios for withdrawal from dialysis as well as 4 other censoring reasons were examined across age groups. In addition, demographic and clinical characteristics associated with withdrawal from dialysis therapy among patients \u226580\u00a0years old was assessed using logistic regression analysis.Among 17,296 patients aged \u226580 years, 10% of patients withdrew from dialysis. Duration from the last hemodialysis treatment to death was 10 [interquartile range 6-16] days in patients with available data. Withdrawal from dialysis was the second and third most common cause of death among patients aged \u226580 years and <80 years, respectively. Among patients \u226580 years, minorities were much less likely than non-Hispanic whites to stop dialysis. Other factors associated with higher odds of dialysis withdrawal included having a central venous catheter compared to an arteriovenous fistula at dialysis start, dementia, living in mid-west regions, and less favorable markers associated with malnutrition-inflammation-cachexia syndrome such as higher white blood cell counts and lower body mass index, albumin, and normalized protein catabolic rate.Among very-elderly incident hemodialysis patients, dialysis therapy withdrawal exhibits wide variations across age, race and ethnicity, regions, cognitive status, dialysis vascular access, and nutritional status. Further studies examining implications of withdrawal from dialysis in older patients are warranted."

With the increasing prevalence of dialysis patients, there is a need to systematically identify the epidemiology of cardiovascular disease in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients.A meta-analysis was conducted in reference to the MOOSE and PRISMA guidelines. Database searches were conducted on Medline and Embase on 17 March 2020. Meta-analysis of proportions was used to summarize the overall prevalence of events. Pairwise comparisons were used to compare between hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, and meta-regression was applied to identify the factors influencing disease.A total of 28 studies were included in the review and prevalence of cardiovascular disease events including coronary artery disease, coronary artery complications, congestive heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, atrial fibrillation, and cardiovascular mortality were summarized. Atrial fibrillation (RR 1.287 CI 1.154-1.436, p\u2009<\u20090.001), congestive heart failure (RR 1.229 CI 1.074-1.407, p\u2009=\u20090.003), and peripheral arterial disease (RR 1.132 CI 1.021-1.255, p\u2009=\u20090.019) were more common in hemodialysis patients, but cardiovascular mortality was lower in hemodialysis relative to peritoneal dialysis patients.

Data were collected from staff at eight hospitals in six states and territories of Australia. Thirty-eight face-to-face interviews were conducted. A modified five-step qualitative content analysis approach was used to analyse the data.Improved visualization technology and its use by interventional radiologists has steered insertions to specialist teams in specialist locations. This is thought to have decreased risk and improved patient outcomes. Nurses were identified as the professional group responsible for maintaining catheter access integrity, preventing access failure and reducing access-related complications. While best practice was considered important, justifications for variations in practice related to local patient and environment challenges were identified.The interdisciplinary team is central in the insertion, maintenance, removal and education of patients regarding dialysis CVCs. Clinicians temper research-based decision-making about central dialysis access catheter management with knowledge of individual, environmental and patient factors. Strategies to ensure guidelines are appropriately translated for use in a wide variety of settings are necessary for patient safety."

An unplanned start to dialysis is defined as receiving nephrology care in the low clearance clinic (or equivalent) for less than 90 days. A planned start is defined as access to pre-dialysis counselling and care for at least 90 days prior to commencing dialysis.The adjusted logistic regression analysis showed that the most important modifiable risk factors for unplanned dialysis were the absence of a chronic kidney disease (CKD) code in the general practice (GP) record (OR 8.02, 95%\u2009CI 3.65 to 17.63) and the absence of prescribed lipid lowering medication (OR 2.37, 95%\u2009CI 1.05 to 5.34). Other contributing factors included male gender and a greater number of long-term conditions.Improving CKD coding in primary care and the additional review and clinical scrutiny associated with this may contribute to a further reduction in unplanned RRT rates."

    "content": "The search for the 'perfect' renal replacement therapy has been paralleled by the search for the perfect biomarkers for assessing dialysis adequacy. Three main families of markers have been assessed: small molecules (prototype: urea); middle molecules (prototype \u03b22-microglobulin); comprehensive and nutritional markers (prototype of the simplified assessment, albumin levels; composite indexes as malnutrition-inflammation score). After an era of standardization of dialysis treatment, personalized dialysis schedules are increasingly proposed, challenging the dogma of thrice-weekly hemodialysis.In this review, we describe the advantages and limitations of the approaches mentioned above, focusing on the open questions regarding personalized schedules and incremental hemodialysis.In the era of personalized dialysis, the assessment of dialysis adequacy should be likewise personalized, due to the limits of 'one size fits all' approaches. We have tried to summarize some of the relevant issues regarding the determination of dialysis adequacy, attempting to adapt them to an elderly, highly comorbidity population, which would probably benefit from tailor-made dialysis prescriptions. While no single biomarker allows precisely tailoring the dialysis dose, we suggest using a combination of clinical and biological markers to prescribe dialysis according to comorbidity, life expectancy, residual kidney function, and small and medium-size molecule depuration."

    "content": "Maintenance hemodialysis is typically prescribed thrice weekly irrespective of a patient's residual kidney function (RKF). We hypothesized that a less frequent schedule at hemodialysis therapy initiation is associated with greater preservation of RKF without compromising survival among patients with substantial RKF.A longitudinal cohort.23,645 patients who initiated maintenance hemodialysis therapy in a large dialysis organization in the United States (January 2007 to December 2010), had available RKF data during the first 91 days (or quarter) of dialysis, and survived the first year.Incremental (routine twice weekly for >6 continuous weeks during the first 91 days upon transition to dialysis) versus conventional (thrice weekly) hemodialysis regimens during the same time.Changes in renal urea clearance and urine volume during 1 year after the first quarter and survival after the first year.Among 23,645 included patients, 51% had substantial renal urea clearance (\u22653.0mL/min/1.73m(2)) at baseline. Compared with 8,068 patients with conventional hemodialysis regimens matched based on baseline renal urea clearance, urine volume, age, sex, diabetes, and central venous catheter use, 351 patients with incremental regimens exhibited 16% (95% CI, 5%-28%) and 15% (95% CI, 2%-30%) more preserved renal urea clearance and urine volume at the second quarter, respectively, which persisted across the following quarters. Incremental regimens showed higher mortality risk in patients with inadequate baseline renal urea clearance (\u22643.0mL/min/1.73m(2); HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.07-2.44), but not in those with higher baseline renal urea clearance (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.76-1.28). Results were similar in a subgroup defined by baseline urine volume of 600mL/d.Potential selection bias and wide CIs.Among incident hemodialysis patients with substantial RKF, incremental hemodialysis may be a safe treatment regimen and is associated with greater preservation of RKF, whereas higher mortality is observed after the first year of dialysis in those with the lowest RKF. Clinical trials are needed to examine the safety and effectiveness of twice-weekly hemodialysis."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Excessive ultrafiltration is associated with intra-dialytic symptoms, loss of residual function, and mortality in haemodialysis patients. A major contributor to excessive ultrafiltration is within-individual variation in pre-dialysis weight and the concept of achieving a fixed target weight by the end of each dialysis session. Haemodialysis protocols which allow variable post-dialysis weight have not been proposed.Weight variation was observed in haemodialysis patients and healthy controls to estimate the proportion of pre-dialysis weight variation which could be considered natural variation. These estimates were used to derive a novel protocol for setting ultrafiltration, which was evaluated by mathematical modelling.Amongst 20 haemodialysis patients, mean (SD) pre-dialysis weight was 102.74 (0.94)% of target weight after a 2-day gap and 103.50 (0.94)% after a 3-day gap. Amongst 10 healthy individuals, mean (SD) daily weight was 100.0 (0.71)% of average weight. A 4-component model of pre-dialysis weight was derived using these estimates, in which the best estimate of pre-dialysis excess fluid is the midpoint of excess weight and average fluid gain, and used to propose a novel protocol for ultrafiltration setting. In simulations, the novel protocol reduced ultrafiltration variation by more than half (standard deviation 0.6 vs. 1.3% of target weight, p < 0.001), without increasing the variation in post-dialysis fluid excess. Excessive ultrafiltration rates (over 13 mL/h/kg) were far less frequent using this protocol (2.6% vs. 7.5% of sessions, p = 0.001).Considering natural weight variation allows the development of a novel protocol for ultrafiltration in which target weight does not have to be achieved precisely: it is therefore a soft target. This protocol, which is predicted to substantially reduce excessive ultrafiltration variation, is a zero-cost intervention with the potential to improve symptoms and clinical outcome for haemodialysis patients."

Neither modality has been consistently shown to confer a clear benefit to patient survival. A key limitation of prior research is that study patients were not restricted to those eligible for both therapies.Retrospective cohort study.All adult patients developing end-stage renal disease from January 2004 to December 2013 at any of 7 regional dialysis centers in Ontario, Canada, who had received at least 1 outpatient dialysis treatment and had\u00a0completed a multidisciplinary modality assessment.HD or PD.Mortality from any cause.Among all incident patients with end-stage renal disease (1,579 HD and 453 PD), PD was associated with lower risk for death among patients younger than 65 years. However, after excluding approximately one-third of all incident patients deemed to be ineligible for PD, the modalities were associated with similar survival regardless of age. This finding was also observed in analyses that were restricted to patients initiating dialysis therapy electively as outpatients. The impact of modality on survival did not vary over time.The determination of PD eligibility was based on the judgment of the multidisciplinary team at each dialysis center.HD and PD are associated with similar mortality among incident dialysis patients who are eligible for both modalities. The effect of modality on survival does not appear to change over time. Future comparisons of dialysis modality should be restricted to individuals who are deemed eligible for both modalities to reflect the outcomes of patients who have the opportunity to choose between HD and PD in clinical practice."

    "content": "Despite growing evidence about the benefits of physical activity and exercise in patients receiving dialysis, physical inactivity is highly prevalent. This may be due to uncertainty and lack of appropriate guidance about exercise, or driven by the relative barriers and benefits that patients perceive. Understanding these perceptions in dialysis patients may inform interventions aimed to increase exercise participation.Perceived benefits and barriers to exercise were measured by the 'Dialysis Patient-perceived Exercise Benefits and Barriers Scale' (DPEBBS). Self-reported physical activity status was assessed by the 'General Practice Physical Activity Questionnaire'. Barriers and benefits to exercise were classed as binary variables (i.e. yes and no). Frequency analyses and chi-squared tests were conducted to compare the differences perceived by people on haemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD). Binominal logistical regression was performed to determine which perceived barriers and benefits had the biggest impact on physical activity status.One thousand twenty-two HD and 124 PD patients completed the DPEBBS. A greater proportion of HD than PD patients reported 'reduces body pain' (P\u2009=\u20090.013), 'delays decline in body function' (P\u2009=\u20090.01), and 'improves quality of life' (P\u2009=\u20090.033) as benefits of exercise. No differences in barriers were observed. Tiredness was the most reported barrier to exercise. Patients who perceived 'other comorbidities' (OR 3.389, P\u2009<\u20090.001) or 'burden of family' (OR 3.168, P\u2009<\u20090.001) as barriers were 3 times more likely to be inactive.Dialysis patients perceive several barriers which may prevent them from engaging in physical activity. Addressing these barriers may be key to increasing participation in physical activity and exercise."

Among them, 68,743 (55%) converted to HD. In this subgroup, monthly rates of acute-care encounters and total costs of care to Medicare sharply increased during the 6 months preceding PD discontinuation, peaking at 96.2 acute-care encounters per 100 patient-months and $20,701 per patient in the last month of PD. After conversion, rates decreased, but remained higher than before conversion. Among patients who converted to in-facility HD, the cumulative incidence of home HD initiation, death, and kidney transplantation at 24 months was 3%, 25%, and 7%, respectively.The transition from PD to HD is characterized by high rates of acute-care encounters and health-care expenditures. Quality improvement efforts should be aimed at improving transitions and encouraging both home HD and kidney transplantation after PD discontinuation."

All participants underwent detailed history taking and complete physical examination, and data on dialysis and laboratory investigations were also collected. Patients were asked \"How long does it take you to recover from a dialysis session?\" to calculate the DRT. We used the Malnutrition-Inflammation Score (MIS) and KDQOL-36 questionnaire to assess patients' nutritional status and quality of life, respectively.Two hundred and ten patients were screened and 191, with a median age of 47\u2009years, completed the study. Patients had a median DRT of 300\u2009minutes (range: 0.0-2880.0), with 55% of patients reporting a DRT of >\u2009240\u2009minutes and 22.5% of them reporting a DRT of <\u200930\u2009minutes.

The results of multivariate analyses showed that dialysate Na (p\u2009=\u20090.003), and the number of missed sessions (p\u2009<\u20090.001) were independently correlated with the DRT.Decreased dialysate Na, and increased number of missed sessions were predictors of prolonged DRT. Patients with prolonged DRT were associated with poorer quality of life. Further randomized clinical trials are needed to assess strategies to minimize the DRT and, perhaps, enhance clinical outcomes.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04727281.

    "content": "Healthcare in general and dialysis care in particular are contributing to resource consumption and, thus, have a notable environmental footprint. Dialysis is a life-saving therapy but it entails the use of a broad range of consumables generating waste, and consumption of water and energy for the dialysis process. Various stakeholders in the healthcare sector are called upon to develop and to take measures to save resources and to make healthcare and dialysis more sustainable. Among these stakeholders are manufacturers of dialysis equipment and water purification systems. Dialysis equipment and consumables, together with care processes need to be advanced to reduce waste generation, enhance recyclability, optimize water purification efficiency and water use. Joint efforts should thus pave the way to enable delivering green dialysis and to contribute to environmentally sustainable health care."

    "content": "In this study, we aimed to determine fibroblast growth factor 23, soluble alpha klotho, osteocalcin, indoxyl sulphate, sclerostin, Procollagen 1 N Terminal Propeptide, and beta-CrossLaps levels in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients, and to compare the levels of these markers among hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients, as well as healthy individuals.The study included 30 hemodialysis and 23 peritoneal dialysis patients who were followed-up for at least six months at the Sakarya University Hospital, besides 30 healthy volunteers.The participants were divided into three groups with similar characteristics in terms of age, gender and body mass index. Fibroblast growth factor 23, soluble alpha klotho, indoxyl sulphate, beta-CrossLaps, and Procollagen 1 N Terminal Propeptide levels were significantly higher in patients of both the hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis groups than in the healthy volunteers' group. There was no difference in levels of these molecules between hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis groups.Fibroblast growth factor 23, sclerostin, indoxyl sulphate, beta-CrossLaps, and Paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain levels were higher in patients of both groups as inflammatory markers. In our study, we found higher soluble alpha klotho levels in patients of both groups than in the healthy volunteers' group, suggesting that blood soluble alpha klotho levels may not correlate with renal klotho levels."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "To describe the population pharmacokinetics (PK) and probability of target attainment (PTA) of continuous infusion (CI) of meropenem in septic patients receiving renal replacement therapy (RRT).Fifteen patients without RRT, 13 patients receiving sustained low-efficiency dialysis and 12 patients receiving continuous veno-venous haemodialysis were included. Population PK analysis with Monte Carlo simulations for different dosing regimens was performed. For minimum inhibitory concentration 2\u00a0mg/L was chosen. The target was set as 50% time \u22654\u00d7 minimum inhibitory concentration.The PK of meropenem was best described by a 1-compartment model with linear elimination. Serum creatinine, residual diuresis and time on RRT, with no difference between sustained low-efficiency dialysis and continuous veno-venous haemodialysis, were found to be significant covariates affecting clearance, explaining >20% of the clearance between subject variability. PTA analysis showed that in patients with RRT, 2\u00a0g/24\u2009h, meropenem CI achieved a PTA of 95%. In patients without RRT, the target was achieved with 3\u00a0g/24\u2009h CI or prolonged infusion of 1\u00a0g meropenem over 8\u00a0hours but not with bolus application of 1\u00a0g meropenem for 8\u00a0hours. Only 2 patients (both without RRT) had meropenem concentrations below the target level. However, approximately half of the patients with RRT receiving CI 3\u00a0g/24\u2009h meropenem had toxic concentrations.We found relevant PK variability for meropenem CI in septic patients with or without RRT, leading to a substantial risk for overdosing in patients with RRT. This finding highlights the strong demand for personalized dosing in critically ill patients."

We aimed to determine the association of RRF, urine output and haemodialysis itself on cardiac biomarkers in haemodialysis patients.Adult haemodialysis patients underwent venesection pre- and post-haemodialysis then echocardiography and inter-dialytic urine collection to calculate RRF (mL/min per 1.73m<sup>2</sup> ) and urine output (mL/day). Galectin-3, BNP-32, NT-ProBNP and hs-TnT levels were compared across tertiles of echocardiographic parameters, RRF and urine output using the non-parametric test for trend across ordered groups.Twenty-three patients (17 male) with mean age 67.7\u00b113.8\u2009years and median (interquartile range) dialysis duration 13.6 (9.8-19.1) months participated. Galectin-3 was substantially lower following haemodialysis: 55\u2009ng/mL (47-70) versus 23\u2009ng/mL (19-27, P\u2009<\u20090.001), but other biomarkers changed little. By increasing RRF tertile, post-dialysis galectin-3 was 32.6\u2009ng/mL (23.7-36.6), 21.9\u2009ng/mL (19.0-23.2) and 19.0\u2009ng/mL (16.9-21.0, P\u2009=\u20090.001); NT-ProBNP was 10\u2009192\u2009ng/L (2303-21\u2009504), 2037\u2009ng/L (1224-10\u2009795) and 1481\u2009ng/L (172-2890, P\u2009=\u20090.016). Results were similar for daily urine volume, but measured echocardiographic parameters were not associated with biomarker concentrations.Plasma concentration of galectin-3 is reduced by the haemodialysis procedure. Lower RRF and urine volume are strongly associated with higher levels of galectin-3 and NT-Pro-BNP. These associations are important to the clinical interpretation of these biomarker levels in haemodialysis patients."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Impaired cognitive functioning in patients with end-stage renal disease may reduce their capabilities to adhere to complex medical or dietary regimens and to fully participate in medical decisions. With decreasing renal function, cognitive abilities are likely to decline, with cognitive dysfunction improving after initiation of dialysis and even being generally reversible after successful renal transplantation. However, little is known about cognitive changes particularly regarding different treatment modalities. To gain further insight into this, we focused on a one-year course of cognitive functions, comparing peritoneal to hemodialysis patients. Within the CORETH-project, two validated neurocognitive tests, assessing executive functioning (Trail Making Test-B) and attention (d2-Revision-Test) and the self-reported Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form Cognitive Function-subscale, were administered to 271 patients at baseline and after one year. Subsamples were matched by propensity score, adjusting for age, comorbidity, education, and employment status for 96 hemodialysis and 101 peritoneal dialysis patients. The effects of time and treatment modality were investigated, controlling for well-known confounders. Both tests revealed improvement over one year. Peritoneal dialysis was associated with better outcomes than hemodialysis at baseline and follow-up, but comparability between groups may be limited. The opposite pattern applied to self-reporting. Hemodialysis patients had to be excluded from cognitive testing more often than peritoneal dialysis patients. As such, the number of exclusions may have biased the findings, limiting generalizability. Thus, our findings suggest an improvement of cognitive functioning and support previous indications for peritoneal dialysis being associated with better cognitive functions during a one-year course than hemodialysis."

    "content": "Hemodialysis (HD) involves purifying the blood of waste products through diffusion through a semipermeable membrane. We aimed to evaluate dialysis practice patterns among children with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on maintenance HD (MHD). This cross-sectional study was conducted on 30 children with ESRD on MHD at the pediatric nephrology unit of Menoufia University and 18 age- and sex-matched children who served as the control group. Consent was obtained from children more than seven years old and their parents and from parents of younger children. They were all subjected to full history, complete physical examination, efficiency measures estimation (for cases), and laboratory investigations. Risk factors for death were determined using the logistic regression model; data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software. The study showed that the causes of ESRD in children were unknown in 43.3%; about 73.3% of cases were short-statured and 53.3% were underweight. About 40% of the cases were hypertensive showing a significant difference from controls (P <0.01). A double-lumen jugular catheter (DLJC) was the initial access in 80% of cases. The urea reduction ratio and Kt/V were significantly higher in children with arteriovenous fistula (AVF) than those with DLJC (P <0.0001 and 0.004), respectively. About 66.7% of cases had anemia showing a significant difference from controls (P <0.01). Hypoalbuminemia, anemia, elevated C-reactive protein, and left ventricular hypertrophy were the significant risk factors resulting in death (P <0.0001). Although the most common initiating vascular access used for HD patients was a DLJC, the efficiency of dialysis was significantly higher in patients who had AVF. Stature was affected more than weight in HD patients in the study group."

    "content": "Renal disease is considered the main cause of natural mortality in dogs with canine leishmaniosis. The pathological mechanisms associated with kidney injury in canine leishmaniosis include immune complex glomerulonephritis, tubulointerstitial nephritis and occasionally renal amyloidosis. Proteinuria is a frequent finding in canine leishmaniosis and its quantification by the urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPC) is an important parameter in the staging of canine lesihmaniosis as presented by the LeishVet group.A 4.5 year-old spayed female Belgian Malinois dog was presented to the Hebrew University Veterinary Teaching hospital with epistaxis and rhinitis and diagnosed also with proteinuria and acute kidney injury (AKI IRIS grade V) associated with canine leishmaniosis that developed to LeishVet stage III with chronic kidney disease (CKD) after stabilization. Clinicopathologic abnormalities included azotemia with a peak creatinine concentration of 7.76 mg/dl (reference interval, 0.3-1.2 ng/dl), hypoalbuminemia (1.76 g/dl, reference interval 3-4.4 g/dl), hyperglobulinemia (4.54 g/dl, reference interval 1.8-3.9 g/dl) and proteinuria (urine protein/creatinine ratio 15.6, normal < 0.2). Serology by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for Leishmania infantum was positive with high antibody levels. The dog was hospitalized and treated with intermittent hemodialysis, feeding through an esophageal feeding tube, medical treatment for protein losing nephropathy and antileishmanial treatment with allopurinol. Kidney function gradually improved and the dog's creatinine levels and proteinuria decreased until complete normalization two years after the acute insult. However, rhinitis and sneezing persisted and although the anti-leishmanial antibodies decreased over time, the dog remains constantly seropositive.To our knowledge, this is the first report of hemodialysis management of AKI associated with canine leishmaniosis. Hemodialysis was imperative in stabilizing the dog's renal disease and controlling its azotemia. It demostrates that hemodialysis can be beneficial in the management of acute deterioration of kidney disease in canine leishmaniosis."

    "content": "A significant proportion of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) associated glomerulonephritis eventually progresses to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) thus requiring long-term dialysis. There is no consensus about which dialysis modality is more recommended for those patients with associated vasculitis (AAV-ESRD). The primary objective of this study was to compare patient survival in patients with AAV-ESRD treated with hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD).This double-center retrospective cohort study included dialysis-dependent patients who were treated with HD or PD. Clinical data were collected under standard format. The Birmingham vasculitis activity score (BVAS) was used to evaluate disease activity at diagnosis and organ damage was assessed using the vasculitis damage index (VDI) at dialysis initiation.In total, 85 patients were included: 64 with hemodialysis and 21 with peritoneal dialysis. The patients with AAV-PD were much younger than the AAV-HD patients (48 vs. 62, <i>P</i> < 0.01) and more were female (76.2 vs. 51.6%, <i>P</i> = 0.05). The laboratory data were almost similar. The comorbidities, VDI score, and immuno-suppressive therapy at dialysis initiation were almost no statistical difference. Patient survival rates between HD and PD at 1 year were 65.3 vs. 90% (<i>P</i> = 0.062), 3 year were 59.6 vs. 90% (<i>P</i> < 0.001), and 5 years were 59.6 vs. 67.5% (<i>P</i> = 0.569). The overall survival was no significant difference between the two groups (<i>P</i> = 0.086) and the dialysis modality (HD or PD) was not shown to be an independent predictor for all-cause death (hazard ratio (HR) 0.73; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31-1.7; <i>P</i> = 0.473). Cardio-cerebrovascular events were the main cause of death among AAV-HD patients while infection in patients with AAV-PD.These results provide real-world data that the use of either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis modality does not affect patient survival for patients with AAV-ESRD who need long-term dialysis."

    "content": "Cirrhotic patients often develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring renal replacement therapy in the form of hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD). Studies comparing the outcomes and difference in in-hospital mortality between these 2 groups, particularly among those with ascites, are sparse. We set our objective to determine the dialysis modality with a better in-hospital survival rate among cirrhotic patients with ESRD (ESRD-cirrhosis).Data was extracted from the 2005 to 2012 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS). Using propensity score matching, ESRD-cirrhosis patients on PD were matched with patients on HD at a 1:1 ratio. Another subgroup analysis of ESRD-cirrhosis patients with ascites was performed using the same matching algorithm. Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).Among 26,135 cirrhotic patients with incident ESRD, 25,686 (98.3%) and 449 (1.7%) were initiated on HD and PD, respectively, during the hospitalization. There was a nonsignificant mortality difference between the ESRD-cirrhosis patients treated with PD and those treated with HD. In a subgroup analysis of these patients with ascites, 18 patients underwent PD while 1,878 patients required HD. Also, PD had a significantly lower in-hospital mortality compared with HD in this subgroup (0% vs 26.67%, <i>p</i> = 0.03). Mean length of stay for those who received HD was 8.34 days compared with 7.06 days for the PD group (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). Similarly, mean hospital charges were greater for those who had HD compared with PD ($74,501 vs $57,460; <i>p</i> < 0.001).Cirrhotic patients with ESRD and ascites who undergo PD have a significantly lower mortality than those who are started on HD. However PD is rarely initiated for ESRD in cirrhotic patients with ascites during hospitalization in the United States. Due to the potential advantages of PD, nephrologists should encourage PD when selecting dialysis modality in this subgroup of patients whenever possible."

Studies were eligible with following criteria: studied in ESRD patients, compare any pair of renal replacement modalities, and reported HRQoL. The unstandardized mean differences (USMD) of HRQoL among modalities were calculated and pooled using a random-effect models if heterogeneity was present, otherwise a fixed-effect model was applied.A total of twenty-one studies were included with 29,000 participants. Of them, mean age and percent male were 48.1\u2009years and 45.1, respectively.

This study evaluated whether L-carnitine supplementation improved muscle spasm, cardiac function, and renal anemia in dialysis patients. Eighty Japanese outpatients (62 hemodialysis (HD) patients and 18 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients) received oral L-carnitine (600 mg/day) for 12 months; the HD patients further received intravenous L-carnitine injections (1000 mg three times/week) for 12 months, amounting to 24 months of treatment. Muscle spasm incidence was assessed using a questionnaire, and cardiac function was assessed using echocardiography. Baseline free carnitine concentrations were relatively low in patients who underwent dialysis for >4 years. Total carnitine serum concentration, free carnitine, and acylcarnitine significantly increased after oral L-carnitine treatment for 12 months, and after intravenous L-carnitine injection. There was no significant improvement in muscle spasms, although decreased muscle cramping after L-carnitine treatment was reported by 31% of patients who had undergone HD for >4 years. Hemoglobin concentrations increased significantly at 12 and 24 months in the HD group. Therefore, L-carnitine may be effective for reducing muscle cramping and improving hemoglobin levels in dialysis patients, especially those who have been undergoing dialysis for >4 years."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "The beneficial effects of renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade on residual renal function (RRF) in patients who have just initiated hemodialysis (HD) have been inconclusive. In this study, 935 patients with incident HD from a nationwide prospective observational cohort in Korea were included for analysis. The primary outcome showed that RRF as demonstrated by urine volume changes over 0, 3, and 12 months differed between the RAAS blockade and control groups. Mixed-effects linear regression was used to compare RRF between the groups. Patients in the RAAS group had a greater proportion of higher urine volume at study enrollment compared to the control group, but there was no difference in baseline characteristics, heart function, and dialysis-related indices. After adjusting for confounding factors, the RAAS group did not provide a significant benefit to RRF in a mixed-effects linear regression (p\u2009=\u20090.51). Male gender, high Charlson comorbidity index, diuretic use, and high weekly ultrafiltration volume were associated with faster decline in RRF. The RAAS group failed to provide a protective effect for the development of anuria 1 year after initiating dialysis based on the multivariate logistic regression (OR 0.73 95% CI 0.25-2.13, p\u2009=\u20090.57). In Korean patients with incident HD, RAAS blockade did not provide a protective effect for RRF after 1 year. Further research is needed to clarify the optimal treatment for preserving RRF in HD patients."

The study was conducted between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2013 (recruitment period), with follow-up until December 31, 2018. The outcome was the cumulative mortality rate at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years. Propensity score matching (PSM) and the Gompertz parametric survival model were used to compare mortality in HD versus PD.The analysis included 12,499 patients, of whom 57.4% were on PD at inception. The overall mortality rate was 14.0 events per 100 patient-years (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.61-14.42). Using an intention-to-treat approach, crude mortality rates were significantly lower in patients receiving HD (HD: 12.3 deaths per 100 patient-years [95% CI, 11.7-12.8] vs. PD: 15.5 [14.9-16.1], p < 0.01). Using a Gompertz parametric survival model, dialysis modality was not significantly associated with mortality (hazard ratio HD vs. PD 1.0, 95% CI, 0.9-1.1). After PSM, the mortality cumulative incidence functions between HD and PD were not statistically significantly different (p = 0.88).The present study in a large cohort of incident dialysis patients with at least 5 years follow-up and using PSM methods showed no differences in cumulative mortality between HD and PD patients. This evidence from a middle-income country may facilitate the process of dialysis modality selection globally."

    "content": "Switch from hemodialysis (HD) to peritoneal dialysis (PD) is unfrequent, but incentive strategies to perform PD can lead to an increase of these transitions. However, data on transitioning from HD to PD are scarce. We hypothesized that time spent on HD before transfer to PD would impact PD outcomes.This registry-based, nationwide study analyzed patients transferred from HD to PD. Patients who began HD between January 2008 and December 2016 were included. Cox and Fine and Gray regression models were used to explore the relationship between time spent on HD before PD and outcomes in PD: PD cessation for death or retransfer to HD (composite endpoint); for death; and for retransfer to HD.Over the study period, 1,985 of the 77,587 HD starters (3%) were transferred to PD. The median time spent on HD before transfer to PD was 1.94 months (interquartile range [IQR] 1.02-4.01). The median survival time on PD after this transition was 20 months (IQR 18-21). Time spent on HD before PD was associated with increased risk of death or retransfer to HD (cause-specific hazard ratio [cs-HR] 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1-1.02 for a 1-month increase) and death (cs-HR 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.03) but not with retransfer to HD censored on death (cs-HR 1.00, 95% CI: 0.99-1.01). The results were similar when considering competing events.Switch from HD to PD is rare in France. Time spent on HD before transfer is associated with patient survival but not with retransfer to HD."

    "content": "Dyspepsia is a common disorder in kidney transplant recipients, and the risk of post-transplant complications is increased in candidates with upper gastrointestinal disease. We evaluated gastrointestinal lesions of kidney transplant candidates on dialysis.In this study, endoscopic and pathological findings in hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients with gastrointestinal symptoms on the waiting list were compared.The most common non-ulcerous lesions in the endoscopic examination were gastritis (62.3%), erosive gastritis (38.7%), duodenal erosion or duodenitis (18.9%) and esophagitis (13.2%). The ulcerous lesion was present in only 3 patients. Gastroesophageal reflux disease, ulcerated lesion and non-ulcerated lesion rates were similar in both dialysis groups. Histopathological examination revealed Helicobacter pylori (HP) positivity in 28.3% of patients. HP positivity rate was significantly higher in PD patients than in HD patients (38.7% vs. 13.6%, p\u2009=\u20090.046). Chronic gastritis (75.5%) was the most common pathological finding. HP positivity rate was 37.5% in patients with chronic gastritis, but HP was negative in patients without chronic gastritis. In multivariate analysis, male gender, urea and albumin levels were associated with the presence of pathological chronic gastritis. The presence of gastritis, total cholesterol and ferritin levels were found significant for HP positivity. A total cholesterol >\u2009243\u2009mg/dL was significantly related to an increased risk of the presence of HP positivity.Gastrointestinal lesions and HP infection are common in dialysis patients. Dialysis modality may affect the frequency of some lesions. It may be useful to have an endoscopic examination before entering the transplant waiting list for all candidates."

We investigated factors associated with changes of bone mineral density (\u0394BMD) during the initial year on dialysis therapy and associations of \u0394BMD with subsequent mortality in ESRD patients initiating dialysis.In 242 ESRD patients (median age 55\u00a0years, 61% men) starting dialysis with peritoneal dialysis (PD; n\u2009=\u2009138) or hemodialysis (HD; n\u2009=\u2009104), whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), body composition, nutritional status and circulating biomarkers were assessed at baseline and 1\u00a0year after dialysis start. We used multivariate linear regression analysis to determine factors associated with \u0394BMD, and fine and gray competing risk analysis to determine associations of \u0394BMD with subsequent mortality risk.BMD decreased significantly in HD patients (significant reductions of BMD<sub>total</sub> and BMD<sub>leg, trunk, rib, pelvis and spine</sub>) but not in PD patients. HD compared to PD therapy associated with negative changes in BMD<sub>total (\u03b2=-\u00a00.15)</sub>, BMD<sub>head (\u03b2=-\u00a00.14)</sub>, BMD<sub>leg (\u03b2=-\u00a00.18)</sub> and BMD<sub>trunk (\u03b2=-\u00a00.16)</sub>. Better preservation of BMD associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality for \u0394BMD<sub>total</sub> (sub-hazard ratio, sHR, 0.91), \u0394BMD<sub>head</sub> (sHR 0.91) and \u0394BMD<sub>leg</sub> (sHR 0.92), while only \u0394BMD<sub>head</sub> (sHR 0.92) had a beneficial effect on CVD-mortality.PD had beneficial effect compared with HD on BMD changes during first year of dialysis therapy. Better preservation of BMD, especially in bone sites rich in cortical bone, associated with lower subsequent mortality. BMD in cortical bone may have stronger association with clinical outcome than BMD in trabecular bone."

Patients' interest and perceived capability of participation were assessed by a 10-item Likert-type scale developed and tested for this study, with responses ranging from 1 (not interested/no perceived capability) to 5 (already doing task independently). Multivariate linear regression was used to assess the relationship between patient characteristics, including age, sex, education level and severity of illness to ratings of activation level and haemodialysis self-care scale scores. The STROBE checklist was used as a guideline for this study.Ninety-one patients and 31 nurses participated. Overall, patients expressed interest (2.43\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.93) and perceived themselves capable (2.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9) of participating in various haemodialysis-related tasks. Nurses assessed lower interest (2.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.77) than patients, but similar average capability (2.31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8). Both greater interest and perceived capability were correlated with more years of education and higher patient activation; additionally, interest was associated with disease severity and perceived capability was associated with age.Haemodialysis patients are interested and perceive themselves capable of participating in the tasks involved in dialysis care. Nurses underestimate patient interest in participation.Self-care behaviours among haemodialysis patients are important, as they may affect quality of life and survival. Determining interest and perceived capability of participation is a first step towards evaluating the feasibility of self-care in a supervised haemodialysis setting."

    "content": "Functional impairment is associated with adverse outcomes in older people, as well as in patients on chronic hemodialysis. The aim of this study was to evaluate if functional impairment represents a risk factor for reduced survival in patients on chronic hemodialysis.All incident chronic hemodialysis patients of Lazio, a large region of central Italy, registered in the Dialysis and Transplant Lazio Region Registry (DTLRR) in the period 2008-2013 were considered eligible. Inclusion criteria were: age\u2009>\u200918 years, resident in Lazio, still doing dialysis after 90\u00a0days from incidence date, doing hemodialysis or hemodiafiltration treatment for >\u20099\u00a0h/week. Patients were stratified into three classes of functional activity: total autonomy, autonomy in some activities, and not self-sufficient. Functional activity was assessed for each patient by the referring physician for the DTLRR from the ~\u200990 hemodialysis units of the Lazio region. Each patient was followed from date of first dialysis treatment to the end of the study (31/12/2015) or death or renal transplant, whichever occurred first. Cox proportional hazard models were performed to obtain mortality hazard ratios (HR), 95% confidence intervals (CI), for each class of functional activity adjusting for sex, age, country of birth, city of residence, body mass index (BMI), type of nephropathy, vascular access, previous nephrology counselling, weekly hours of hemodialysis, serum albumin, hemoglobin, and presence of comorbidities (e.g. vascular diseases, coronary disease, and diabetes).A total of 3356 patients were studied. In the whole follow-up period, 1622 deaths occurred (48%). Functional impairment was associated with the risk of mortality: compared to 'total autonomy', the HR for 'autonomy in some activities' was 1.30 [95% CI: 1.14-1.49] and for 'not self-sufficient' 1.71 [1.47-1.99] (p for trend\u2009<\u20090.05). The number of evitable deaths attributable to reduced functional activity was 237.Functional impairment represents a risk factor for reduced survival in chronic hemodialysis patients. There is a need for early identification of patients who might benefit from interventions aimed at preventing, reversing or delaying the functional impairment."

    "title": "Estimation of residual renal function using beta-trace protein: Impact of dialysis procedures.",
    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Beta-trace protein (BTP), a low molecular weight protein of 23-29\u00a0kDa, has been proposed as a promising biomarker to estimate residual renal function (RRF) in patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD). Indeed, BTP is cleared by native kidney but not during conventional HD session. By contrast, the removal rate of BTP using convective processes (mainly hemodiafiltration [HDF]) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) has been little or not investigated. Therefore, an aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of dialysis procedures (high-flux HD, on-line post-dilution HDF and PD) on BTP removal in comparison with beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) and cystatin C (CYSC) removals after a single session. In addition, the ability of BTP to predict RRF in PD was assessed. This observational cross-sectional study included a total of 82 stable chronic kidney disease patients, 53 patients were on maintenance dialysis (with n\u00a0=\u00a026 in HD and n\u00a0=\u00a027 in HDF) and 29 were on PD. Serum concentrations of BTP, B2M, and CYSC were measured (a) before and after a single dialysis session in HD and HDF anuric patients to calculate reduction percentages, (b) in serum, 24-hour-dialysate and 24-hour-urine in PD patients to compute total, peritoneal, and urinary clearance. RRF was estimated using four equations developed for dialysis patients without urine collection and compared to the mean of the urea and creatinine clearances in PD. The concentrations of the three studied molecules were significantly reduced (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) after dialysis session with significantly higher reduction ratio using HDF compared to HD modality (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001): BTP 49.3% vs 17.5%; B2M 82.3% vs 69.7%; CYSC 77.4% vs 66% in HDF and HD, respectively. In non-anuric PD patients, B2M and CYSC were partly removed by peritoneal clearance (72.3% and 57.6% for B2M and CYSC, respectively). By contrast, BTP removal by the peritoneum was negligible and a low bias for the BTP-based equation to estimate RRF (-1.4\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0m<sup>2</sup> ) was calculated. BTP is significantly removed by high-flux HD or HDF, thereby compromising its use to estimate RRF. By contrast, BTP appears as a promising biomarker to estimate RRF in PD patients since it is not affected by peritoneal clearance, unlike B2M and CYSC, and it is well correlated to RRF."

We evaluated some demographic and clinical characteristics as well as compared the mortality rate between men and women with end-stage renal disease on haemodialysis (HD), to find out if gender has any influence on mortality.This was a single centre retrospective study. All adult incident and prevalent haemodialysis patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) seen between July 2007 and June 2019 were enrolled in the study. Data collected included age, sex, hepatitis B and C viral status, vascular access at the commencement of haemodialysis, duration on haemodialysis, number of dialysis sessions ever conducted and outcome of haemodialysis. The outcome was stratified as alive, dead, or lost to follow up. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality. The IBM SPSS Statistical software version 23 was used to analyse the data. Kaplan Meier survival curve was used to compare all-cause mortality between men and women.This study included 995 HD patients of whom 704 (70.8%) were males. Mean age was 44.7 + 16.3 years. At the end of the study period, 878 (88.2%) patients died. The mortality rates for men and women did not significantly differ with a cumulative median survival of 17 and 16 days respectively (Log-rank = 0.85, p = 0.358). Hepatitis B seropositivity was significantly associated with increased mortality (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 1.2; 95% CI 1.025 - 1.526).Despite the perceived poor access to modern healthcare services by women in Northern Nigeria, there is no gender disparity in crude mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease on haemodialysis."

The aim of this study was to examine the status and correlates of mobile health readiness among individuals on dialysis.A cross-sectional 30-item questionnaire guided by the Khatun mobile health readiness conceptual model was distributed to individuals on dialysis from 21 in-center hemodialysis facilities and 14 home dialysis centers. The survey assessed the availability of devices and the internet, proficiency, and interest in using mobile health.In total, 949 patients (632 hemodialysis and 317 home dialysis) completed the survey. Of those, 81% owned smartphones or other internet-capable devices, and 72% reported using the internet. The majority (70%) reported intermediate or advanced mobile health proficiency. The main reasons for using mobile health were appointments (56%), communication with health care personnel (56%), and laboratory results (55%). The main reported concerns with mobile health were privacy and security (18%). Mobile health proficiency was lower in older patients: compared with the 45- to 60-years group, respondents in age groups <45, 61-70, and >70 years had adjusted odds ratios of 5.04 (95% confidence interval, 2.23 to 11.38), 0.39 (95% confidence interval, 0.24 to 0.62), and 0.22 (95% confidence interval, 0.14 to 0.35), respectively.

    "content": "This systematic review aimed to investigate whether non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT) can reduce systemic inflammatory levels and improve metabolism in patients undergoing haemodialysis (HD) and/or peritoneal dialysis (PD).Electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CNKI, and WFPD) were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) performed through July 2019. The risk of bias within studies was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's risk assessment tool. The systemic inflammatory and metabolic outcomes included the highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), the albumin (Alb), and lipid metabolite levels. Meta-analyses (MAs) were performed to calculate the overall effect size where appropriate.Five RCTs were included in this study. Compared with untreated periodontitis groups, the dialysis patients after NSPT significantly showed decreased hs-CRP levels at less than or equal to 2\u2009months (standardized mean difference: -\u20091.53, 95% confidence interval\u2009-\u20092.95 to -\u20090.11). No significant difference was found in IL-6 and Alb levels following NSPT at either the 3- or 6- month follow-ups. No MAs could be performed on the TNF-a level and the lipid metabolic markers.NSPT can moderately reduce serum hs-CRP levels in HD and/or PD patients, but did not significantly change IL-6 or Alb levels. For TNF-a and lipid metabolism markers, no sufficient evidence supports that these levels are changed after NSPT. Additional scientific research is necessary to assess the effects of NSPT on systemic inflammation and metabolic parameters in dialysis patients."

Patients in hemodialysis therapy are particularly vulnerable to developing an infectious disease, but the incidence and prognosis of hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 is still unclear. The main objective is to describe the experience of our dialysis unit in preventing and controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Preventive structural and organizational changes were applied to all patients and health care personnel in order to limit the risk of local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection.The Nephrology department at Sant Joan Desp\u00ed Moises Broggi Hospital-Consorci Sanitari Integral is a reference for two satellite hemodialysis centers caring for 156 patients. We combine our own hemodialysis maintenance program for 87 patients with hospitalized patients from peripheral hemodialysis centers. In this area, the reported incident rate of COVID-19 in these peripherical hemodialysis centers was 9.5% to 19.9% and the death rate 25% to 30.5%. In our hemodialysis program, the incidence rate was 5.7%. Three out of five required hospitalization (60%) and nobody died.Although the risk of local transmission of the disease was very high due to the increase in hemodialysis patients from peripheral centers admitted to hospital, the incidence rate of COVID-19 was very low in our own hemodialysis patients. We believe that the structural and organizational changes adopted early on and the diagnosis algorithm played an important role in minimizing the spread of the disease."

The aim of our study was to analyze the importance of dialysis dose (Kt/V) during online postdilution hemodiafiltration (HDF) for early detection of AV fistula stenosis.Hemodialysis patients with AV fistula were included in this study. We compared a group of 44 patients who have undergone fistulography and subsequently percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of significant AV fistula stenosis (active group) with a group of 44 age- and sex-matched patients without PTA (control group). Observational time in both groups was the same.All patients had postdilution online HDF using a F5008 dialysis machine, which can measure online single-pool Kt/V. All data were analyzed during the performance of 2056 HDF procedures. In the active group, we found statistically significantly lower values of Kt/V, all 8 weeks before PTA. In the active group, there was a significant improvement in Kt/V in the first (p < 0.001) and second week (p = 0.049) after PTA. Three and 8 weeks after PTA, we did not find any statistically significant difference in Kt/V between both groups (p = 0.114; p = 0.058). Patients in the active group had statistically significantly lower substitution volumes and blood pump flow rates during HDF over the whole observation period before and after PTA. In contrast, there were no differences in venous pressure in the dialysis circuit between both groups throughout the observation period.In hemodialysis patients with AV fistula, treated with online HDF, routine measurements of Kt/V during each HDF are a beneficial, quick, and straightforward method for early detection of hemodynamically significant AV fistula stenosis."

We retrospectively analyzed data from 40 patients that received maintenance HD who had available home BP and ABPM data. Dialysis unit BPs were the averages of pre-, 2hr- (2\u2009h after starting HD), and post-HD BP during a 9-month study. Home BP was defined as the average of morning and evening home BPs. Dialysis unit BP and home BP were compared over the 9-month study period. ABPM was performed once for 24\u2009h in the absence of dialysis during the final 2\u2009weeks of the study period and was compared to the 2-week dialysis unit BP and home BP. There was a significant difference between dialysis unit systolic blood pressure (SBP) and home SBP over the 9-month period. No significant difference was observed between the 2hr-HD SBP and home SBP. When analyzing 2\u2009weeks of dialysis unit BP and home BP, including ABPM, SBPs were significantly different (dialysis unit BP > home BP > ABPM; P\u00a0=\u00a00.009). Consistent with the 9-month study period, no significant difference was observed between 2hr-HD SBP and home SBP (P\u00a0=\u00a00.809). The difference between 2hr-HD SBP and ambulatory SBP was not significant (P\u00a0=\u00a00.113). In conclusion, the 2hr-HD SBP might be useful for predicting home BP and ABPM in HD patients."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "There are multiple risk factors for inflammation in dialysis. One potential cause is the presence of circulating levels of Gram-negative bacteria-derived endotoxin which is a strong inducer of inflammation. Gut-associated endotoxin may enter the circulation via a defective blood-gut barrier during episodes of hypotension or reduced perfusion.In this study, 165 patients receiving outpatient-based hemodialysis in a facility (FHD) or at home (HHD), were studied. Levels of inflammation were quantified by developing an inflammatory score derived from the measurement of pro-inflammatory cytokines, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Intradialytic blood pressure (BP) variability and hypotension events were recorded. This included the final session of dialysis, at the commencement of which the blood samples were drawn, as well as the five preceding sessions.The median inflammatory score was 2 (range 0 - 3), and 30% of patients had an inflammatory score of three suggesting significant levels of inflammation. Only 8.5% had an inflammatory score of 0. Endotoxin was measured in all participants and was only positive in N = 3. The mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 134 \u00b1 20 mmHg and the BP variability was 11.7 \u00b1 3.5. In a multivariable ordinal regression model, a higher inflammatory score was significantly associated with younger age (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.95 - 0.99, p = 0.03), higher ultrafiltration volume (OR 1.62, CI 1.04 - 2.54, p = 0.03) and lower body mass index (OR 0.9, CI 0.86 - 0.96, p = 0.01). There was no association between inflammatory score and dialysis modality, access type, kidney replacement therapy (KRT), BP variability, or endotoxin. Endotoxin was detected in only 3 of 165 patients and was not associated with inflammation.Pre-dialysis levels of inflammation are prevalent in the hemodialysis population after the long break but are not related to intradialytic BP variability or hypotension in the preceding 2 weeks. However, endotoxemia is uncommon and unlikely to be a significant driver of inflammation."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Vascular calcification is seen in most patients on dialysis and is strongly associated with cardiovascular mortality. Vascular calcification is promoted by phosphate, which generally reaches higher levels in hemodialysis than in peritoneal dialysis. However, whether vascular calcification develops less in peritoneal dialysis than in hemodialysis is currently unknown. Therefore, we compared coronary artery calcification (CAC), its progression, and calcification biomarkers between patients on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.We measured CAC in 134 patients who had been treated exclusively with hemodialysis (n = 94) or peritoneal dialysis (n = 40) and were transplantation candidates. In 57 of them (34 on hemodialysis and 23 on peritoneal dialysis), we also measured CAC progression annually up to 3 years and the inactive species of desphospho-uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein (dp-ucMGP), fetuin-A, osteoprotegerin. We compared CAC cross-sectionally with Tobit regression. CAC progression was compared in 2 ways: with linear mixed models as the difference in square root transformed volume score per year (\u0394CAC SQRV) and with Tobit mixed models. We adjusted for potential confounders.In the cross-sectional cohort, CAC volume scores were 92 mm3 in hemodialysis and 492 mm3 in peritoneal dialysis (adjusted difference 436 mm3; 95% CI -47 to 919; p = 0.08). In the longitudinal cohort, peritoneal dialysis was associated with significantly more CAC progression defined as \u0394CAC SQRV (adjusted difference 1.20; 95% CI 0.09 to 2.31; p = 0.03), but not with Tobit mixed models (adjusted difference in CAC score increase per year 106 mm3; 95% CI -140 to 352; p = 0.40). Peritoneal dialysis was associated with higher osteoprotegerin (adjusted p = 0.02) but not with dp-ucMGP or fetuin-A.Peritoneal dialysis is not associated with less CAC or CAC progression than hemodialysis, and perhaps with even more progression. This indicates that vascular calcification does not develop less in peritoneal dialysis than in hemodialysis."

However, the association between dialysis modality and IDs remains unclear. We aimed to determine the association between the dialysis modality and IDs.This retrospective observational cohort study compared the emergency hospitalization and mortality for IDs between peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) patients. After propensity score matching, the risk factors were evaluated by the Cox proportional hazard regression models.A total of 260 patients were compared - 130 of 135 PD and 130 of 706 HD patients. When the modality-specific ID (PD-catheter ID/peritonitis- and vascular access-related ID) was excluded, no significant differences in emergency hospitalization and mortality rates for overall IDs were observed between the PD and HD groups.

When modality-specific ID was included, the emergency hospitalization rate for overall IDs was higher in the PD groups, and PD was a significant predictor of emergency hospitalization for IDs, whereas no significant difference in mortality rate for overall IDs was found between the PD and HD groups.ID events were not associated with dialysis modality when modality-specific ID was excluded, whereas the risk of modality-specific IDs was higher in PD than HD. Serum ferritin and ALP as well as age, male sex, CRP, and CCI were the risk factors for ID events."

    "content": "The relationship between chronic kidney disease and development of heart failure is a well-known clinical entity. Systolic dyssynchrony index (SDI_16) is a new diagnostic tool for detection of subclinical left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction by using three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE). We aimed to investigate this parameter in patients with end-stage renal disease who were receiving hemodialysis and patients with renal transplant compared to healthy control subjects.Forty-five hemodialysis patients, 45 patients with renal transplant and 45 age-sex matched healthy control subjects included in the study. All participants were evaluated with 3DE in the interdialytic phase for measurement of LV volumes, ejection fraction and SDI_16 parameter.Both LV diastolic and systolic volumes were significantly higher in hemodialysis group compared to renal transplant group and healthy controls, but this finding did not translate to a statistically significant difference for LVEF measurements between groups (58.71 \u00b1 3.53 vs. 57.17 \u00b1 2.97 vs. 59.23 \u00b1 3.26, p = .16 for renal transplant and hemodialysis and healthy control groups, respectively). Mean value of SDI_16 parameters was significantly higher in hemodialysis group compared to renal transplant group (7.93 \u00b1 2.50 vs. 3.72 \u00b1 1.71, p < .001) and healthy controls (7.93 \u00b1 2.50 vs. 3.00 \u00b1 .99, p < .001); whereas, it was similar between renal transplant group and control subjects (3.72 \u00b1 1.71 vs. 3.00 \u00b1 .99, p = .10).SDI_16 was significantly higher in hemodialysis patients compared to patients with renal transplant and healthy controls."

    "title": "Primary outcomes of the Monitoring in Dialysis Study indicate that clinically significant arrhythmias are common in hemodialysis patients and related to dialytic cycle.",
    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Sudden death is one of the more frequent causes of death for hemodialysis patients, but the underlying mechanisms, contribution of arrhythmia, and associations with serum chemistries or the dialysis procedure are incompletely understood. To study this, implantable loop recorders were utilized for continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring to detect clinically significant arrhythmias including sustained ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, asystole, or symptomatic arrhythmias in hemodialysis patients over six months. Serum chemistries were tested pre- and post-dialysis at least weekly. Dialysis procedure data were collected at every session. Associations with clinically significant arrhythmias were assessed using negative binomial regression modeling. Sixty-six patients were implanted and 1678 events were recorded in 44 patients. The majority were bradycardias (1461), with 14 episodes of asystole and only one of sustained ventricular tachycardia. Atrial fibrillation, although not defined as clinically significant arrhythmias, was detected in 41% of patients. With thrice-weekly dialysis, the rate was highest during the first dialysis session of the week and was increased during the last 12 hours of each inter-dialytic interval, particularly the long interval. Among serum and dialytic parameters, only higher pre-dialysis serum sodium and dialysate calcium over 2.5 mEq/L were independently associated with clinically significant arrhythmias. Thus, clinically significant arrhythmias are common in hemodialysis patients, and bradycardia and asystole rather than ventricular tachycardia may be key causes of sudden death in hemodialysis patients. Associations with the temporal pattern of dialysis suggest that modification of current dialysis practices could reduce the incidence of sudden death."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the intraocular pressure during hemodialysis and hemodiafiltration. Fifteen patients were enrolled (seven treated with hemodialysis therapy and eight with hemodiafiltration). The intraocular pressure was measured before and after dialysis and every 30 min during dialysis. Before dialysis, both groups had similar dialysis prescription, blood pressure, and biochemical parameters. At the end of dialysis, potassium, and osmolarity decreased in both groups, while systolic blood pressure and sodium decreased in the hemodialysis group, and glucose decreased in the hemodiafiltration group. Mean intraocular pressure was similar between groups at all measured times and had no significant changes during hemodialysis. During minute 120 of hemodiafiltration, mean intraocular pressure in the left eye decreased significantly compared to minute 90. This suggests a high intra-individual variability of intraocular pressure during both types of dialysis, which could be relevant particularly among those with the risk of glaucoma."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Chronic renal failure can lead to dialysis and/or a kidney transplant in the final stage. The number of patients under dialysis has increased considerably in the world and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Dialysis is a very expensive care. This is the reason why this study on the costs of dialysis management was initiated in Burkina Faso. The objective of the study is to determine the direct medical and non-medical costs of managing chronic renal failure among dialysis patients in Ouagadougou in 2020.An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted. Data were collected in the hemodialysis department of three public university hospitals in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. All dialysis patients with chronic renal failure were included in the study. Linear regression was used to investigate the determinants of the direct medical and non-medical cost of hemodialysis.A total of 290 patients participated in this study, including children, adults, and the elderly with extremes of 12 and 82 years. Almost half of the patients (47.5%) had no income. The average monthly total direct cost across all patients was 75842 CFA or US$134.41.The average direct medical cost was 51315 CFA or US$90.94 and the average direct non-medical cost was 24 527 CFA or US$43.47. Most of the patients (45.2%) funded their hemodialysis by their own source. The multivariate analysis showed that the presence of an accompanying person during treatment, residing in a rural area, ambulatory care, use of personal cars, and treatment at the dialysis center of Yalgado Teaching Hospital were associated with higher direct costs.The average cost of dialysis services borne by the patient and his family is very high in Burkina Faso, since it is 2.1 times higher than the country's minimum interprofessional wage (34664 CFA or US$61.4). It appears that the precariousness of the means of subsistence increases strongly with the onset of chronic renal failure requiring dialysis. Thus, to alleviate the expenses borne by dialysis patients, it would be important to extend the government subsidy scheme to the cost of drugs and to promote health insurance to ensure equitable care for these patients."

    "content": "Hemodialysis is associated with a high symptom burden that impairs health-related quality of life and functional status. Effective symptom management is a priority for individuals receiving hemodialysis. Aerobic exercise may be an effective, nonpharmacologic treatment for specific hemodialysis-related symptoms. This systematic review investigated the effect of aerobic exercise on hemodialysis-related symptoms in adults with kidney failure undergoing maintenance hemodialysis.We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, EMBASE, PEDro, and Scopus databases from 1960 or inception until April 15, 2020 for randomized controlled trials investigating the effect of aerobic exercise on hemodialysis-related symptoms, identified as prespecified primary or secondary outcomes, as compared with controls in adults on maintenance hemodialysis. We identified restless legs syndrome as the primary outcome.Of 3048 studies identified, 15 randomized controlled trials met the eligibility criteria. These studies investigated the effect of aerobic exercise on restless legs syndrome (two studies), sleep disturbance (four studies), anxiety (four studies), depression (nine studies), muscle cramping (one study), and fatigue (one study). Exercise interventions were intradialytic in ten studies and outside of hemodialysis in five studies. Heterogenous interventions and outcomes and moderate to high risk of bias precluded meta-analysis for most symptoms. Aerobic exercise demonstrated improvement in symptoms of restless legs syndrome, muscle cramping, and fatigue, as compared with nonexercise controls. Meta-analysis of depressive symptoms in studies using the Beck Depression Inventory demonstrated a greater reduction in Beck Depression Inventory score with exercise as compared with control (mean difference -7.57; 95% confidence interval, -8.25 to -6.89).Our review suggests that in adults on maintenance hemodialysis, aerobic exercise improves several hemodialysis-related symptoms, including restless legs syndrome, symptoms of depression, muscle cramping, and fatigue. However, the use of validated outcome measures with demonstrated reliability and responsiveness in more diverse hemodialysis populations is required to fully characterize the effect of this intervention.PROSPERO #CRD42017056658."

    "content": "Much attention is given to patient and provider engagement, cost, and quality. Nephrology is in a unique position to examine the intersection of these issues given kidney dialysis is delivered at a high cost to chronically ill patients. Annual dialysis treatments in Canada range from $56,000-$107,000 per patient dependent on modality. Economists quantify the preferred modality by calculating cost effectiveness through quality-adjusted life years or determining utilization through Discrete Choice Experiments (DCEs). Cost-effectiveness studies identify peritoneal dialysis as the most economical, yet it is the least used. Discrete choice experiments address patient preferences but rarely include cost attributes. This presents a unique paradigm: cost studies do not include patient or physician perspectives, and DCEs do not consider cost. This systematic review of dialysis cost-effectiveness studies and DCEs identifies an opportunity to increase engagement and transparency by involving all care partners in assessing quality and cost."

    "content": "The increase in the survival rate of patients with chronic renal failure due to substitution treatment prompts an investigation of their quality of life (QoL), a key measure to evaluate the outcomes of chronic disease treatment. To determine whether hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis provide a better QoL, a systematic meta-analysis was performed.We searched through the database Cinahl, Medline, PubMed, Scopus and Proquest, including articles published from 2011 until June 2016. We selected articles that compared, through KDQOL-SF 1.3 or 36 questionnaires, QoL among patients undergoing hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. The data was collected using Excel Office, and t-test has been performed on independent samples to identify significant differences.Only some of the seven articles found significant differences between the two treatments. One of the studies showed a better QoL for peritoneal dialysis patients, while, on the contrary, two other studies support that the best QoL is in patients receiving hemodialysis. Another article displayed significant difference only for satisfaction in relation to care, better in patients on peritoneal dialysis, and for physical health, better in hemodialysis.The analysis has not led to a unanimous conclusion. Quantitative analysis showed that the only statistically significant difference between the QoL of patients on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis regards the effect of kidney disease, which happens to be better in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Haemodialysis (HD) was the first procedure that had demonstrated the ability to partially replace renal function, and became the most widely utilized treatment for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In a great majority of countries around the world, conventional in-centre HD had become the predominant renal replacement therapy, being touted as able to achieve better solute clearance and more successful in attaining euvolemia than patients on peritoneal dialysis. This is despite the antecedent hemodynamic risks, more rapid loss of residual renal function, greater infectious perils, excessive erythropoietin requirements and higher infrastructure costs. In addition, quality of life had been suggested to be worse among patients on HD, though this had been challenged repeatedly. Consequently, the concept of integrated ESRD care over the last few decades had placed HD, as a complementary rather than a competitive treatment modality to the entire armamentarium of renal replacement therapies. Incorporating HD as part of integrated care into health-care policies and national resource planning will become an essential strategy in improving access and outcome to care among the ESRD population. The improvement in technologies and innovation in prescription had brought forth enhanced dialyzer membrane and machine upgrades, and expanded modalities including more frequent HD and haemodiafiltration. While boasting of controversial improvement in outcomes, many of these therapies remain expensive and insurmountable for widespread utility in many countries. In addition, the results of these new technologies had been conflicting across studies, with some even suggesting that they could be detrimental. Therefore, judicial consideration has to be undertaken to appropriate their use in clinical practice."

    "category": "hemodialysis",
    "content": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent sustained arrhythmia worldwide and it aggravates cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; however, this is largely under-diagnosed. Moreover, among end-stage renal disease patients on haemodialysis, AF is substantially more common and serious. The researchers conducted this study to assess the prevalence of, and the factors correlated with AF in Jordanian haemodialysis patients.In a cross-sectional analysis conducted from October 2018 to February 2019 in four tertiary hospitals, the researchers enrolled all consenting patients aged 18\u2009years or older who were on haemodialysis for at least three months prior to the study. We screened for AF clinically by pulse palpation, precordial auscultation, by an automated blood pressure monitor and an electrocardiogram. The researchers reported qualitative variables as counts and frequencies, while continuous variables were summarised using the mean or median where necessary. We used multiple logistic regression with backward selection to identify independent risk factors of AF.A total of 231 patients were enrolled; mean age was 54.8\u2009\u00b1\u200915.6\u2009years (from 20 to 86), and 44.3% of them were women. The prevalence of AF was found to be 7.8% (95% CI, 4.8-12.2), with no gender disparity. Age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]\u2009=\u20091.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.10; p\u2009=\u20090.031), history of ischaemic heart disease (AOR\u2009=\u20093.74; 95% CI, 1.09-12.34; p\u2009=\u20090.033), history of smoking (AOR\u2009=\u20090.15; 95% CI, 0.02-0.60; p\u2009=\u20090.019), and low interdialytic weight gain (AOR\u2009=\u20090.50: 95% CI, 0.25-0.91; p\u2009=\u20090.031) were independently correlated to AF.The prevalence of AF among patients on maintenance haemodialysis is high, but largely undiagnosed. AF is generally associated with advancing age, history of ischaemic heart disease, lower interdialytic weight gain, and history of smoking. We suggest routine check-up of AF in this high-risk group of patients as anticoagulant therapy if indicated may prevent serious complications. However, there is a need for large-scale cohort studies and for the creation of regional chronic kidney disease and dialysis registries in the Middle East region."

    "content": "microRNA-122 (miR-122) is a hepatotoxicity biomarker with utility in the management of paracetamol overdose and in drug development. Renal dysfunction and haemodialysis have been associated with a reduction in circulating microRNA. The objective of this study was to determine their effect on miR-122.Blood samples were collected from 17 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on haemodialysis, 22 healthy controls, 30 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 15 patients post-kidney transplantation. All had normal standard liver function tests. Samples from ESRD patients were collected immediately pre- and post-haemodialysis. Serum alanine transaminase activity (ALT), miR-122 and miR-885 (liver enriched) were compared.Circulating miR-122 was substantially reduced in ESRD patients pre-haemodialysis compared with the other groups (19.0-fold lower than healthy controls; 21.7-fold lower than CKD). Haemodialysis increased miR-122 from a median value of 6.7 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> (2.3 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> -1.4 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> ) to 1.6 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> (5.4 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> -3.2 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> ) copies\u00a0ml<sup>-1</sup> . The increase in miR-122 did not correlate with dialysis adequacy. miR-122 was reduced in the argonaute 2 bound fraction pre-haemodialysis; this fraction was increased post-dialysis. There was no change in miR-122 associated with extracellular vesicles. miR-885 was also reduced in ESRD patients (4-fold compared to healthy subjects) and increased by haemodialysis.miR-122 is substantially lower in ESRD compared to healthy controls, patients with CKD and transplanted patients. Haemodialysis increases the concentration of miR-122. These data need to be considered when interpreting liver injury using miR-122 in patients with ESRD on dialysis, and specific reference ranges that define normal in this setting may need to be developed."
