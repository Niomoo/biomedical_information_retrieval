    "title": "Subsequent malignant neoplasms in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study: Occurrence of cancer types in which human papillomavirus is an established etiologic risk factor.",
    "content": "Human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMN<sub>HPV</sub> ) in childhood cancer survivors are poorly understood.The cumulative risk of SMN<sub>HPV</sub> was assessed among 24,363 Childhood Cancer Survivor Study participants. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and absolute excess risk were calculated using age-matched, sex-matched, and calendar year rates from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. Poisson regression models identified SMN<sub>HPV</sub> risk factors, evaluating relative SIRs (rSIR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).In total, 46 survivors developed an SMN<sub>HPV</sub> (median age, 31 years [range, 10-56 years]; median time from primary cancer, 21 years [range, 9-35 years]). SMN<sub>HPV</sub> sites included oropharynx (N = 44), anorectum (N = 6), uterine cervix (N = 2), and vulva (N = 2). The 33-year cumulative incidence was 0.3% (95% CI, 0.2%-0.4%), and the SIR was nearly 3-fold that of the general population (SIR, 2.86; 95% CI, 2.05-4.00). Female survivors were not at increased risk of cervical or vulvar cancers compared with the general population. All survivors had an elevated risk of oropharyngeal SMN<sub>HPV</sub> (males: SIR, 4.06; 95% CI, 2.37-6.97; females: SIR, 8.44; 95% CI 4.88-14.61) and anorectal SMN<sub>HPV</sub> (males: SIR, 13.56; 95% CI, 5.09-36.13; females: SIR, 9.15; 95% CI, 2.29-36.61). Males (vs females: rSIR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.00-3.94); head, neck, and pelvic radiotherapy doses >3000 centigray (vs none: rSIR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.11-4.97); and cisplatin-equivalent doses >400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (vs none: rSIR, 4.51; 95% CI, 1.78-11.43) were associated with increased SMN<sub>HPV</sub> SIRs in multivariable analysis.Childhood cancer survivors are at increased risk for SMN in sites susceptible to HPV-associated malignancies. Further research examining HPV in the etiology of SMN and the promotion of HPV vaccination and surveillance guidelines for SMN<sub>HPV</sub> in cancer survivors is warranted."

    "title": "Excess risk of subsequent malignant neoplasms in adolescent and young adult cancer survivors: Results from the first Italian population-based cohort.",
    "content": "Evidence about late effects in adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors is scarce. This study assessed the risk of subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMNs) to identify the most common SMNs to be considered in follow-up care.Population-based cancer registries retrospectively identified first primary tumors (between 1976 and 2013) and SMNs in AYAs (15-39\u00a0years old at their cancer diagnosis). AYA cancer survivors were those alive at least 5\u00a0years after their first cancer diagnosis. The excess risk of SMNs was measured as standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and absolute excess risk together with the cumulative incidence of SMNs.The cohort included 67,692 AYA cancer survivors. The excess risk of developing any SMN (SIR, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-1.7) was 60%. The excess risk of SMNs was significantly high for survivors of lymphomas; cancers of the breast, thyroid, female genital tract, digestive organs, gonads, and urinary tract; and melanomas. The cumulative incidence of all SMNs in AYA cancer survivors within 25\u00a0years of their first cancer diagnosis was approximately 10%. Subsequent tumors contributing to approximately 60% of all SMNs were breast cancer, colorectal cancer, corpus uteri cancer, and ovarian cancer in females and colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and lymphomas in males.These results highlight the need to personalize follow-up strategies for AYA cancer survivors."

    "title": "Radiation-response in primary fibroblasts of long-term survivors of childhood cancer with and without second primary neoplasms: the KiKme study.",
    "content": "The etiology and most risk factors for a sporadic first primary neoplasm in childhood or subsequent second primary neoplasms are still unknown. One established causal factor for therapy-associated second primary neoplasms is the exposure to ionizing radiation during radiation therapy as a mainstay of cancer treatment. Second primary neoplasms occur in 8% of all cancer survivors within 30\u00a0years after the first diagnosis in Germany, but the underlying factors for intrinsic susceptibilities have not yet been clarified. Thus, the purpose of this nested case-control study was the investigation and comparison of gene expression and affected pathways in primary fibroblasts of childhood cancer survivors with a first primary neoplasm only or with at least one subsequent second primary neoplasm, and controls without neoplasms after exposure to a low and a high dose of ionizing radiation.Primary fibroblasts were obtained from skin biopsies from 52 adult donors with a first primary neoplasm in childhood (N1), 52 with at least one additional primary neoplasm (N2+), as well as 52 without cancer (N0) from the KiKme study. Cultured fibroblasts were exposed to a high [2 Gray (Gy)] and a low dose (0.05\u00a0Gy) of X-rays. Messenger ribonucleic acid was extracted 4\u00a0h after exposure and Illumina-sequenced. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were computed using limma for R, selected at a false discovery rate level of 0.05, and further analyzed for pathway enrichment (right-tailed Fisher's Exact Test) and (in-) activation (z\u2009\u2265|2|) using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.After 0.05\u00a0Gy, least DEGs were found in N0 (n\u2009=\u2009236), compared to N1 (n\u2009=\u2009653) and N2+\u2009(n\u2009=\u2009694). The top DEGs with regard to the adjusted p-value were upregulated in fibroblasts across all donor groups (SESN1, MDM2, CDKN1A, TIGAR, BTG2, BLOC1S2, PPM1D, PHLDB3, FBXO22, AEN, TRIAP1, and POLH). Here, we observed activation of p53 Signaling in N0 and to a lesser extent in N1, but not in N2+. Only in N0, DNA (excision-) repair (involved genes: CDKN1A, PPM1D, and DDB2) was predicted to be a downstream function, while molecular networks in N2+\u2009were associated with cancer, as well as injury and abnormalities (among others, downregulation of MSH6, CCNE2, and CHUK). After 2\u00a0Gy, the number of DEGs was similar in fibroblasts of all donor groups and genes with the highest absolute log<sub>2</sub> fold-change were upregulated throughout (CDKN1A, TIGAR, HSPA4L, MDM2, BLOC1SD2, PPM1D, SESN1, BTG2, FBXO22, PCNA, and TRIAP1). Here, the p53 Signaling-Pathway was activated in fibroblasts of all donor groups. The Mitotic Roles of Polo Like Kinase-Pathway was inactivated in N1 and N2+. Molecular Mechanisms of Cancer were affected in fibroblasts of all donor groups. P53 was predicted to be an upstream regulator in fibroblasts of all donor groups and E2F1 in N1 and N2+. Results of the downstream analysis were senescence in N0 and N2+, transformation of cells in N0, and no significant effects in N1. Seven genes were differentially expressed in reaction to 2\u00a0Gy dependent on the donor group (LINC00601, COBLL1, SESN2, BIN3, TNFRSF10A, EEF1AKNMT, and BTG2).Our results show dose-dependent differences in the radiation response between N1/N2+\u2009and N0. While mechanisms against genotoxic stress were activated to the same extent after a high dose in all groups, the radiation response was impaired after a low dose in N1/N2+, suggesting an increased risk for adverse effects including carcinogenesis, particularly in N2+."

    "title": "Chemotherapy and Risk of Subsequent Malignant Neoplasms in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study Cohort.",
    "content": "Therapeutic radiation in childhood cancer has decreased over time with a concomitant increase in chemotherapy. Limited data exist on chemotherapy-associated subsequent malignant neoplasm (SMN) risk.SMNs occurring > 5 years from diagnosis, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers, were evaluated in survivors diagnosed when they were < 21 years old, from 1970 to 1999 in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (median age at diagnosis, 7.0 years; median age at last follow-up, 31.8 years). Thirty-year SMN cumulative incidence and standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were estimated by treatment: chemotherapy-only (n = 7,448), chemotherapy plus radiation (n = 10,485), radiation only (n = 2,063), or neither (n = 2,158). Multivariable models were used to assess chemotherapy-associated SMN risk, including dose-response relationships.Of 1,498 SMNs among 1,344 survivors, 229 occurred among 206 survivors treated with chemotherapy only. Thirty-year SMN cumulative incidence was 3.9%, 9.0%, 10.8%, and 3.4% for the chemotherapy-only, chemotherapy plus radiation, radiation-only, or neither-treatment groups, respectively. Chemotherapy-only survivors had a 2.8-fold increased SMN risk compared with the general population (95% CI, 2.5 to 3.2), with SIRs increased for subsequent leukemia/lymphoma (1.9; 95% CI, 1.3 to 2.7), breast cancer (4.6; 95% CI, 3.5 to 6.0), soft-tissue sarcoma (3.4; 95% CI, 1.9 to 5.7), thyroid cancer (3.8; 95% CI, 2.7 to 5.1), and melanoma (2.3; 95% CI, 1.5 to 3.5). SMN rate was associated with > 750 mg/m<sup>2</sup> platinum (relative rate [RR] 2.7; 95% CI, 1.1 to 6.5), and a dose response was observed between alkylating agents and SMN rate (RR, 1.2/5,000 mg/m<sup>2</sup>; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.3). A linear dose response was also demonstrated between anthracyclines and breast cancer rate (RR, 1.3/100 mg/m<sup>2</sup>; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.6).Childhood cancer survivors treated with chemotherapy only, particularly higher cumulative doses of platinum and alkylating agents, face increased SMN risk. Linear dose responses were seen between alkylating agents and SMN rates and between anthracyclines and breast cancer rates. Limiting cumulative doses and consideration of alternate chemotherapies may reduce SMN risk."

    "title": "Subsequent neoplasms in childhood cancer survivors.",
    "content": "The aim of the study was to characterize subsequent neoplasm (SN) (malignant (SMN), benign (BSNs), and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC)) treated previously for a childhood solid malignant tumor at the Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Motol University Hospital, Prague.We evaluated a cohort of 4059 childhood cancer survivors treated between 1975 and 2018.From 4059 survivors, 170 (4.3 %) developed at least one SMN - 193 SMNs in 170 survivors, 21 of them (0.5 % of all survivors) had two or more SMNs and 34 of them (0.8 %) had one SMN and one or more BSNs. Mortality for an SMN was 38.2 % i.e. 1.6 % of all survivors. The most frequent SMNs were thyroid carcinoma (37, 19.2 %), tumors of the central nervous system (25, 13.0 %), soft tissue sarcoma (23, 11.9 %), breast carcinoma (19, 9.8 %), and leukemia (11, 5.7 %). Genetic syndromes were present in 25 patients with SMNs (14.7 %) and in 16 patients with only BSNs (13.4 %). SMNs usually developed in second decade or later after finishing of therapy. We observed some not well known risk factors of SNs e.g. spinal irradiation or<sup>131-</sup>I metaiodobenzylguanidine radiotherapy in 2 cases of secondary thyroid cancer, cyclophosphamide therapy in all 8 cases of secondary urinary bladder sarcoma or 4 from 7 SNMSC developed SMN.We confirmed data from previous studies of SNs and observed some not so well known risk factors. Our results and the literature show that the incidence of SMNs is 3-10 % of survivors and is associated with high mortality."

    "title": "Adherence to Surveillance for Second Malignant Neoplasms and Cardiac Dysfunction in Childhood Cancer Survivors: A Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.",
    "content": "To evaluate childhood cancer survivors' adherence to surveillance protocols for late effects of treatment and to determine the factors affecting adherence.Between 2014 and 2016, 11,337 survivors and 2,146 siblings in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study completed a survey ascertaining adherence to Children's Oncology Group (COG) guidelines for survivors at high risk for second malignant neoplasms or cardiac dysfunction and to the American Cancer Society (ACS) cancer screening guidelines for average-risk populations. Adherence rates and factors affecting adherence were analyzed.Median age at diagnosis was 7 years (range, 0-20.9 years), and median time from diagnosis was 29 years (range, 15-47 years). Among high-risk survivors, adherence to COG breast, colorectal, skin, and cardiac surveillance was 12.6% (95% CI, 10.0% to 15.3%), 37.0% (34.1% to 39.9%), 22.3% (21.2% to 23.4%), and 41.4% (40.1% to 42.7%), respectively. Among average-risk survivors, adherence to ACS breast, cervical, and colorectal screening was 57.1% (53.2% to 61.0%), 83.6% (82.7% to 84.5%), and 68.5% (64.7% to 72.2%), respectively. Twenty-seven percent of survivors and 20.0% of primary care providers (PCPs) had a survivorship care plan (SCP). For high-risk survivors, SCP possession was associated with increased adherence to COG breast (22.3% <i>v</i>. 8.1%; prevalence ratio [PR], 2.52; CI, 1.59 to 4.01), skin (34.8% <i>v</i> 23.0%; PR, 1.16; CI, 1.01 to 1.33), and cardiac (67.0% <i>v</i> 33.1%; PR, 1.73; CI, 1.55 to 1.92) surveillance. For high-risk survivors, PCP possession of a SCP was associated only with increased adherence to COG skin cancer surveillance (36.9% <i>v</i> 23.2%; PR, 1.24; CI, 1.08 to 1.43).Guideline adherence is suboptimal. Although survivor SCP possession is associated with better adherence, few survivors and PCPs have one. New strategies to improve adherence are needed."

    "title": "Childhood cancer mortality trends in the Americas and Australasia: An update to 2017.",
    "content": "Marked reductions in childhood cancer mortality occurred over the last decades in high-income countries and, to a lesser degree, in middle-income countries. This study aimed to monitor mortality trends in the Americas and Australasia, focusing on areas showing unsatisfactory trends.Age-standardized mortality rates per 100,000 children (aged 0-14\u00a0years) from 1990 to 2017 (or the last available calendar year) were computed for all neoplasms and 8 leading childhood cancers in countries from the Americas and Australasia, using data from the World Health Organization database. A joinpoint regression was used to identify changes in slope of mortality trends for all neoplasms, leukemia, and neoplasms of the central nervous system (CNS) for major countries.Over the last decades, childhood cancer mortality continued to decrease by approximately 2% to 3% per year in Australasian countries (ie, Japan, Korea, and Australia), by approximately 1.5% to 2% in North America and Chile, and 1% in Argentina. Other Latin American countries did not show any substantial decrease. Leukemia mortality declined in most countries, whereas less favorable trends were registered for CNS neoplasms, particularly in Latin America. Around 2016, death rates from all neoplasms were 4 to 6 per 100,000 boys and 3 to 4 per 100,000 girls in Latin America, and 2 to 3 per 100,000 boys and approximately 2 per 100,000 girls in North America and Australasia.Childhood cancer mortality trends declined steadily in North America and Australasia, whereas they were less favorable in most Latin American countries. Priority must be given to closing the gap by providing high-quality care for all children with cancer worldwide.Advances in childhood cancer management have substantially improved the burden of these neoplasms over the past 40\u00a0years, particularly in high-income countries. This study aimed to monitor recent trends in America and Australasia using mortality data from the World Health Organization. Trends in childhood cancer mortality continued to decline in high-income countries by approximately 2% to 3% per year in Japan, Korea, and Australia, and 1% to 2% in North America. Only a few Latin American countries showed favorable trends, including Argentina, Chile, and Mexico, whereas other countries with limited resources still lagged behind."

    "title": "Cancer diagnostic profile in children with structural birth defects: An assessment in 15,000 childhood cancer cases.",
    "content": "Birth defects are established risk factors for childhood cancer. Nonetheless, cancer epidemiology in children with birth defects is not well characterized.Using data from population-based registries in 4 US states, this study compared children with cancer but no birth defects (n\u00a0=\u00a013,111) with children with cancer and 1 or more nonsyndromic birth defects (n\u00a0=\u00a01616). The objective was to evaluate cancer diagnostic characteristics, including tumor type, age at diagnosis, and stage at diagnosis.Compared with the general population of children with cancer, children with birth defects were diagnosed with more embryonal tumors (26.6% vs 18.7%; q\u00a0<\u00a00.001), including neuroblastoma (12.5% vs 8.2%; q\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and hepatoblastoma (5.0% vs 1.3%; q\u00a0<\u00a00.001), but fewer hematologic malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (12.4% vs 24.4%; q\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In age-stratified analyses, differences in tumor type were evident among children younger than 1\u00a0year and children 1 to 4\u00a0years old, but they were attenuated among children 5 years of age or older. The age at diagnosis was younger in children with birth defects for most cancers, including leukemia, lymphoma, astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma, embryonal tumors, and germ cell tumors (all q\u00a0<\u00a00.05).The results indicate possible etiologic heterogeneity in children with birth defects, have implications for future surveillance efforts, and raise the possibility of differential cancer ascertainment in children with birth defects.Scientific studies suggest that children with birth defects are at increased risk for cancer. However, these studies have not been able to determine whether important tumor characteristics, such as the type of tumor diagnosed, the age at which the tumor is diagnosed, and the degree to which the tumor has spread at the time of diagnosis, are different for children with birth defects and children without birth defects. This study attempts to answer these important questions. By doing so, it may help scientists and physicians to understand the causes of cancer in children with birth defects and diagnose cancer at earlier stages when it is more treatable."

    "title": "Cancer predisposition syndromes as a risk factor for early second primary neoplasms after childhood cancer - A national cohort study.",
    "content": "Childhood cancer patients are at increased risk of second primary neoplasms (SPNs). We assessed incidence and risk factors for early SPNs with a focus on cancer predisposition syndromes (CPSs).This cohort study used data from the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry. We included patients with first primary neoplasms (FPNs) diagnosed before age 21 years from 1986 to 2015 and identified SPNs occurring before age 21. We calculated standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) and absolute excess risks (AERs) using Swiss population cancer incidence data, and cumulative incidence of SPNs. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) of risk factors for SPNs using Fine and Gray competing risk regression.Among 8074 childhood cancer patients, 304 (4%) were diagnosed with a CPS and 94 (1%) developed early SPNs. The incidence of SPNs was more than 10-fold higher in childhood cancer patients than the incidence of neoplasms in the general population (SIR = 10.6, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.7-13.1) and the AER was 179/100,000 person-years (CI: 139-219). Cumulative incidence of SPNs 20 years after FPN diagnosis was 23% in patients with CPSs (CI: 12-41%) and 2.7% in those without (CI: 2.0-3.6%). Risk factors for SPNs were CPSs (HR = 7.8, CI: 4.8-12.7), chemotherapy (HR = 2.2, CI: 1.1-4.6), radiotherapy (HR = 1.9, CI = 1.2-2.9), haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HR = 1.8, CI: 1-3.3), and older age (15-20 years) at FPN diagnosis (HR = 1.9, CI: 1.1-3.2).CPSs are associated with a high risk of SPNs before age 21 years. Identification of CPSs is important for appropriate cancer surveillance and targeted screening."

    "content": "Obesity is a known modifiable risk factor associated with adverse outcomes in children with cancer. We sought to determine whether obesity during childhood cancer treatment increases risk for second malignant neoplasms (SMN).In this case-control study, cases (with SMN) and controls (with a single-primary cancer) were selected from the California Cancer Registry who had primary cancer diagnosed <21 years treated at Children's Hospital Los Angeles between 1988 and 2014. Controls were matched 3:1 to cases at the registry level by clinical factors. Medical records were abstracted for cancer treatment exposures, cancer predisposition syndrome, body mass index (BMI), BMI Z-score, and BMI category at diagnosis and end of therapy (EOT).A total of 59 cases and 130 controls were included. Median age at primary cancer diagnosis was 6 years, 64.5% were male, median time from primary cancer to SMN was 7.5 years, and 31.7% were obese or overweight. In matched multivariable analyses, there were elevated but nonsignificant associations between SMN and higher BMI Z-score at diagnosis [OR 1.27 (0.99-1.63)] and higher BMI categories at diagnosis [adjusted OR (aOR) overweight, 1.25 (0.55-2.52); aOR obese, 2.51 (1.00-6.29)]. There was a significantly increased risk for SMN among patients who were obese at both diagnosis and EOT [aOR, 4.44 (1.37-14.34)].This study suggests that obesity during childhood cancer treatment may be associated with increased risk for SMNs, particularly among those obese throughout therapy.Additional studies to confirm these findings and to develop interventions have the potential to impact SMN development in children with cancer."

There was a predominance of male patients, aged 50-59 years, mostly Caucasians, and with a low level of schooling. Throughout the period there was a significant reduction in the positive history of alcohol and tobacco consumption, except for alcoholic beverages in oral cavity cancer. Most patients were diagnosed at an advanced stage of the disease (III or IV). Most patients with oral cavity cancer had no evidence of the disease on follow-up, while most patients with oropharyngeal cancer died. The first most frequent treatment offered to patients with oral cavity cancer was surgery, while for patients with oropharyngeal cancer it chemoradiotherapy predominated.Despite the fact that, in general, there was a reduction in the records of patient alcohol and tobacco consumption, the increase in the number of medical consultations, the predominantly late diagnosis and the patients' low level of schooling indicate the need for health education, primary prevention and early diagnosis of cancer of the oral cavity and oropharynx."

The cumulative incidence of SGMNs was estimated by Fine-Gray competing risk regression. Poisson regression was used to evaluate the radiotherapy-associated risk for SGMNs in patients undergoing radiotherapy vs patients not undergoing radiotherapy. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess the survival outcomes of patients with SGMNs.Of 20\u202f142 patients, 16\u202f802 patients (83.4%) were White and the median age was 65 years (interquartile range, 54-74 years).

The cumulative incidence of SGMNs during 30 years of follow-up was 4.53% among patients who received radiotherapy and 1.53% among patients who did not. In competing risk regression analysis, undergoing radiotherapy was associated with a higher risk of developing cancer of the uterine corpus (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.06; 95% CI, 2.14-4.37; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and ovarian cancer (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.22-3.56; P\u2009=\u2009.007) compared with those who did not receive radiotherapy. The dynamic radiotherapy-associated risks (RR) for cancer of the uterine corpus significantly increased with increasing age at rectal cancer diagnosis (aged 20-49 years: adjusted RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.35-1.79; P\u2009=\u2009.57; aged 50-69 years: adjusted RR, 3.74; 95% CI, 2.63-5.32; P\u2009<\u2009.001; aged \u226570 years: adjusted RR, 5.13; 95% CI, 2.64-9.97; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and decreased with increasing latency since rectal cancer diagnosis (60-119 months: adjusted RR, 3.22; 95% CI, 2.12-4.87; P\u2009<\u2009.001; 120-239 months: adjusted RR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.75-4.24; P\u2009<\u2009.001; 240-360 months: adjusted RR, 1.95; 95% CI, 0.67-5.66; P\u2009=\u2009.22), but the dynamic RR for ovarian cancer increased with increasing latency since rectal cancer diagnosis (60-119 months: adjusted RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.26-1.89; P\u2009=\u2009.48; 120-239 months: adjusted RR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.09-4.70; P\u2009=\u2009.03; 240-360 months: adjusted RR, 11.84; 95% CI, 2.18-64.33; P\u2009=\u2009.004). The 10-year overall survival among patients with radiotherapy-associated cancer of the uterine corpus was significantly lower than that among matched patients with primary cancer of the uterine corpus (21.5% vs 33.6%; P\u2009=\u2009.01).Radiotherapy for rectal cancer was associated with an increased risk of cancer of the uterine corpus and ovarian cancer. Special attention should be paid to reduce radiotherapy-associated SGMNs and improve their prognosis."

    "content": "In this study, we aimed to investigate the age-related risk of second breast cancer (SBC) and second gynecological malignant neoplasms (SGMNs) in female differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) survivors by utilizing the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.A total number of 55,622 female DTC patients were identified between 1975 and 2016, including 2168 patients who developed SBC and SGMNs. The Fine and Gray model was used to calculate the cumulative incidence and sub-distribution hazards ratios (SHR). Poisson regression analysis was employed to calculate the relative risk (RR) and standardized incidence ratio (SIR). Kaplan-Meier survival and log-rank test analyses were also performed.The overall 40-year cumulative incidence of SBC and SGMNs was 18.9%. Their incidence in the adolescent and young adults (AYA) group increased slowly in the first 30 years, but then was rapidly elevated in the last decade. It increased gradually in the middle-aged adults group and in the first 25 years in the older adults group, but it scarcely increased thereafter. Both the middle-aged adults (adjusted SHR, 2.09; RR, 1.76) and the older adults (adjusted SHR, 1.32; RR, 1.58) groups had higher risks of developing combined SBC and SGMNs than the AYA group. The risks increased mainly in the early latency period. The three groups also had higher SIRs than the US general population. Besides, the best survival after SBC and SGMNs was observed in the AYA group.Age was an independent risk factor for SBC and SGMNs incidences among female DTC survivors."

    "content": "Childhood cancer survivors are confronted with various chronic health conditions like therapy-related malignancies. However, it is unclear how exposure to chemotherapy contributes to the mutation burden and clonal composition of healthy tissues early in life. Here, we studied mutation accumulation in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) before and after cancer treatment of 24 children. Of these children, 19 developed therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN). Posttreatment HSPCs had an average mutation burden increase comparable to what treatment-na\u00efve cells accumulate during 16 years of life, with excesses up to 80 years. In most children, these additional mutations were induced by clock-like processes, which are also active during healthy aging. Other patients harbored mutations that could be directly attributed to treatments like platinum-based drugs and thiopurines. Using phylogenetic inference, we demonstrate that most t-MN in children originate after the start of treatment and that leukemic clones become dominant during or directly after chemotherapy exposure.Our study shows that chemotherapy increases the mutation burden of normal blood cells in cancer survivors. Only few drugs damage the DNA directly, whereas in most patients, chemotherapy-induced mutations are caused by processes similar to those present during normal aging. This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1825."

    "content": "Exposure to cranial radiotherapy is associated with an increased risk of subsequent CNS neoplasms among childhood, adolescent, and young adult (CAYA) cancer survivors. Surveillance for subsequent neoplasms can translate into early diagnoses and interventions that could improve cancer survivors' health and quality of life. The practice guideline presented here by the International Late Effects of Childhood Cancer Guideline Harmonization Group was developed with an evidence-based method that entailed the gathering and appraisal of published evidence associated with subsequent CNS neoplasms among CAYA cancer survivors. The preparation of these guidelines showed a paucity of high-quality evidence and highlighted the need for additional research to inform survivorship care. The recommendations are based on careful consideration of the evidence supporting the benefits, risks, and harms of the surveillance interventions, clinical judgment regarding individual patient circumstances, and the need to maintain flexibility of application across different health-care systems. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to establish whether early detection of subsequent CNS neoplasms reduces morbidity and mortality, and therefore no recommendation can be formulated for or against routine MRI surveillance. The decision to start surveillance should be made by the CAYA cancer survivor and health-care provider after careful consideration of the potential harms and benefits of surveillance for CNS neoplasms, including meningioma."

    "content": "To investigate cancer treatment plus pathogenic germline mutations (PGMs) in DNA repair genes (DRGs) for identification of childhood cancer survivors at increased risk of subsequent neoplasms (SNs).Whole-genome sequencing was performed on blood-derived DNA from survivors in the St Jude Lifetime Cohort. PGMs were evaluated in 127 genes from 6 major DNA repair pathways. Cumulative doses of chemotherapy and body region-specific radiotherapy (RT) were abstracted from medical records. Relative rates (RRs) and 95% CIs of SNs by mutation status were estimated using multivariable piecewise exponential models.Of 4,402 survivors, 495 (11.2%) developed 1,269 SNs. We identified 538 PGMs in 98 DRGs (<i>POLG</i>, <i>MUTYH</i>, <i>ERCC2</i>, and <i>BRCA2</i>, among others) in 508 (11.5%) survivors. Mutations in homologous recombination (HR) genes were significantly associated with an increased rate of subsequent female breast cancer (RR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.8 to 7.7), especially among survivors with chest RT \u2265 20 Gy (RR, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.6 to 12.4), or with a cumulative dose of anthracyclines in the second or third tertile (RR, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.7 to 11.4). Mutations in HR genes were also associated with an increased rate of subsequent sarcoma among those who received alkylating agent doses in the third tertile (RR, 14.9; 95% CI, 4.0 to 38.0). Mutations in nucleotide excision repair genes were associated with subsequent thyroid cancer for those treated with neck RT \u2265 30 Gy (RR, 12.9; 95% CI, 1.6 to 46.6) with marginal statistical significance.Our study provides novel insights regarding the contribution of genetics, in combination with known treatment-related risks, for the development of SNs. These findings have the potential to facilitate identification of high-risk survivors who may benefit from genetic counseling and/or testing of DRGs, which may further inform personalized cancer surveillance and prevention strategies."

    "content": "Long-term childhood and young adult cancer survivors are at increased risk of the late effects of multiple chronic conditions. In this study we estimate the cumulative burden of subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMN), cardiovascular and respiratory hospitalisations in long-term survivors of childhood and young adult cancers and associated treatment risks.Five-year survivors of cancer diagnosed aged 0-29 years between 1992-2009 in Yorkshire, UK were included. The cumulative count of all hospital admissions (including readmissions) for cardiovascular and respiratory conditions and all SMNs diagnosed up to 2015 was calculated, with death as a competing risk. Associations between treatment exposures and cumulative burden were investigated using multiple-failure time survival models.A total of 3464 5-year survivors were included with a median follow-up of 8.2 years (IQR 4-13 years). Ten-years post diagnosis, the cumulative incidence for a respiratory admission was 6.0 % (95 %CI 5.2-6.9), a cardiovascular admission was 2.0 % (95 %CI 1.5-2.5), and SMN was 1.0 % (95 % CI 0.7-1.4) with an average of 13 events per 100 survivors observed (95 %CI 11-15). The risk of experiencing multiple events was higher for those treated with chemotherapy drugs with known lung toxicity (HR = 1.35, 95 %CI 1.09-1.68).Survivors of childhood and young adult cancer experience a high burden of morbidity due to respiratory, cardiovascular diseases and SMNs up to 20-years post-diagnosis. Statistical methods that capture multiple morbidities and recurrent events are important when quantifying the burden of late effects in young cancer survivors."

    "content": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the detection rate of incidental second primary neoplasms in patients with prostate cancer on <sup>18</sup>F-fluciclovine PET/CT. <b>Methods:</b> Imaging reports and patient demographic data were retrospectively reviewed from 663 clinical <sup>18</sup>F-fluciclovine PET/CT studies, performed in 601 patients for the assessment of their prostate cancer (643 - recurrence evaluation, 20 - initial staging) from August 2016 to April 2021. Maximum SUV (SUV<sub>max</sub>) of the suspected second neoplasms was determined. The results of <sup>18</sup>F-fluciclovine PET/CT were correlated with clinical and radiologic studies to determine the nature of the suspected second neoplasms. <b>Results:</b> Fifty-five patients (9.1%) had findings suggestive of a second neoplasm. Thirty-nine of 55 had a known second neoplasm diagnosed before the PET/CT. An incidental second primary neoplasm was first suspected on <sup>18</sup>F-fluciclovine PET/CT in 16 of 601 patients (2.7%). Three of the 16 patients had PET/CT suggestive of a meningioma that was corroborated on MRI. Of the remaining 13 patients, 11 had a tissue diagnosis confirming a malignancy. Second malignancies included renal cell carcinoma (RCC; 5/11; 45.5%), urothelial carcinoma (<i>n</i> = 2), multiple myeloma, chondrosarcoma, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus and lung (<i>n</i> = 1, each; except for 1 patient with both esophageal and lung carcinomas). Among histopathologically confirmed malignancies, clear-cell RCC had the lowest uptake (SUV<sub>max</sub> 3.4), and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma had the highest uptake (SUV<sub>max</sub> 13.6). Of the 2 patients with no histopathologic confirmation, 1 had ultrasound and MRI findings corroborating the diagnosis of RCC.

    "content": "Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms are categorized as neuroendocrine tumors and neuroendocrine carcinomas. Until now, cancer registry reporting of pancreatic cancers does not include a stratification by these two subgroups. We studied the incidence and survival of pancreatic cancer with a special focus on pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms.We analyzed data from the population-based cancer registries of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) and Saarland (SL), Germany, of the years 2009-2018. We included primary malignant pancreatic tumors and report morphology-specific age-standardized (World Standard population) incidence rates for ages 0-79 years and age-standardized relative survival (period approach, ICSS standard). All analyses were restricted to non-death certificate only cases.We analyzed 23,037 patients with a newly diagnosed primary pancreatic cancer. Among morphologically specified cancers, adenocarcinoma (92\u00a0%) and neuroendocrine neoplasms (7\u00a0%) were the most common morphologies. The age-standardized incidence rates of adenocarcinoma, neuroendocrine tumors and neuroendocrine carcinomas were 4.0-5.5 (in NRW and SL), 0.1-0.3, and 0.1-0.3 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. Neuroendocrine tumors had the highest age-standardized 5-year relative survival with 75.5\u00a0% (standard error, SE 2.3) in NRW and 90.6\u00a0% (SE 10.2) in SL followed by neuroendocrine carcinomas (NRW: 30.0\u00a0%, SE 3.1; SL: 32.3\u00a0%, SE 8.7) and adenocarcinomas (NRW: 11.3\u00a0%, SE 0.4; SL: 10.2\u00a0%, SE 1.5).The distinction between neuroendocrine tumors and neuroendocrine carcinomas by the WHO divides neuroendocrine neoplasms into two prognostically clearly distinct subgroups that should be separately analyzed in terms of survival. The first year after diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is the most critical year in terms of survival."

    "content": "The suicide risk after a new cancer diagnosis remains a controversial issue. This study examines the suicide risk within the year after a cancer diagnosis. This is the largest study to assess recent trends in suicide risk after a cancer diagnosis.Data were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. All patients diagnosed with cancer between 2000 and 2014 were selected. The event was defined as death due to suicide within the first year after a cancer diagnosis, and patients who experienced the event after their diagnosis were observed. The observed/expected (O/E) ratio was assessed as well as the excess risk per 10,000 person-years to determine the suicide risk change after the diagnosis in comparison with the general population.A total of 4,671,989 patients with cancer were included; 1585 committed suicide within 1 year of their diagnosis. The risk of suicide increased significantly with an O/E ratio of 2.52 and with an excess risk of 2.51 per 10,000 person-years. When the risk of suicide was studied according to the cancer site, the highest increases in the O/E ratio came after diagnoses of pancreatic cancer (8.01) and lung cancer (6.05). The risk of suicide also increased significantly after a diagnosis of colorectal cancer with an O/E ratio of 2.08. However, the risk of suicidal death did not increase significantly after breast and prostate cancer diagnoses.The risk of suicide increases significantly in the first year after a diagnosis of cancer in comparison with the general population, and this increase varies with the type and prognosis of cancer. Close observation and referral to mental health services, when indicated, are important for mitigating such risk."

    "content": "As public awareness of health has increased and diagnostic and treatment options have improved, the survival of patients with malignant tumors has continued to extend, and the population has been aging, the number of multiple primary malignant neoplasms has gradually increased in recent years. There are few reports concerning female patients with multiple primary malignant neoplasms of breast cancer or genitalia malignancies. In this study, we aimed to analyze the clinical characteristics and prognosis of multiple primary malignant neoplasms in female patients with breast cancer or genitalia malignancies, as well as further explore the factors that affect the survival.We collected clinical data on 80 female patients diagnosed with multiple primary malignant neoplasms of the breast or genitalia, described their clinical features. Furthermore, we calculated the survival and prognostic factors for 52 participants.In our study, the prevalence rate of multiple primary malignant neoplasms was 0.66% (367/55404). Corresponding to female patients with multiple primary malignant neoplasms of breast cancer or genitalia malignancies, it was 1.4% (80/5707). the median age of diagnosis for the first tumor was 48 years, and the median age of diagnosis for the second tumor was 52 years. Regarding the interval, 67.57% (50/74) of patients were within five years. Most tumors were located in the breast (44.68%), followed by the uterus (20.21%), the ovary (17.02%), and the cervix (15.96%). The overall 12-, 36-and 60-month survival rates of the patients were 86.4%, 74.3%, and 69.8%. For the female patients, the stage (III-IV) (<i>P</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.046), non-radical surgery (<i>P</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.002), and types of the last tumor (breast cancer or genitalia malignancies) (<i>P</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.019) were associated with the poor prognosis.Female patients with breast cancer or genital malignancies should pay attention to screening for the second tumor, especially within 4 years after the first tumor diagnosed. Furthermore, during tumor screening, it may be recommended for these patients to focus on colorectal cancer and lung cancer. Compared with previous studies, in addition to clinical staging and types of surgery, we found whether the last tumor was breast cancer or genitalia malignancies should also be considered a prognostic factor."

    "content": "Pathology laboratories are one of the main information sources for cancer registries and have traditionally been coded with SNOMED; some of them are migrating to SNOMED CT (SCT). Cancer registries encode topography and morphology of neoplasms by the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O). ICD-O updates morphology with WHO Classification of Tumors (Blue-Books). Morphological codes of the ICD-O, Blue-Books and SNOMED (former SNOMEDID) have always coincided. In 2017, SCT removed the SNOMEDID.to define neoplastic and topographic subsets in SCT and map them to ICD-O-3.1/Blue-Books; reduce the original number of SCT concepts; correctly identify neoplasms in the laboratories in accordance with international cancer registry rules.SCT neoplastic concepts were identified by manual revision and SCT resources (\"is a\", \"Associated morphology\" relationships; Simple Map Reference Set). Topographic concepts were extracted from the body structure hierarchy of SCT. Both subsets were mapped to ICD-O-3.1/Blue-Books, afterwards. Updating algorithms were designed to automate and update each subset with every SCT release. The process of neoplasms identification was validated in a sample of 5212 specimens with 7378 records from 8 Catalan hospitals.The number of concepts in neoplastic and topographic subsets (16,448 and 32,278) was reduced after the mapping to ICD-O-3.1/Blue-Books (2115 and 330, respectively). Neoplastic subset classified the specimens correctly in the 98.6% of the specimens.This article presents a flexible tool to exhaustively identify neoplasms in pathology laboratories that code with SCT, following international PBCRs standards and in line with the pathologists, oncologists and epidemiologists' needs."

    "title": "Genetic variation as a modifier of association between therapeutic exposure and subsequent malignant neoplasms in cancer survivors.",
    "content": "Subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMNs) are associated with significant morbidity and are a major cause of premature mortality among cancer survivors. Several large studies have demonstrated a strong association between the radiation and/or chemotherapy used to treat primary cancer and the risk of developing SMNs. However, for any given therapeutic exposure, the risk of developing an SMN varies between individuals. Genomic variation can potentially modify the association between therapeutic exposures and SMN risk and may explain the observed interindividual variability. In this review, the author provides a brief overview of the current knowledge regarding the role of genomic variation in the development of therapy-related SMNs and discusses the methodological challenges in undertaking an endeavor to develop a deeper understanding of the molecular underpinnings of therapy-related SMNs, such as an appropriate study design, the identification of an adequately sized study population together with a reliable plan for collecting and maintaining high-quality DNA, clinical validation of the phenotype, and the selection of an appropriate approach or platform for genotyping. Understanding the factors that can modify the risk of treatment-related SMNs is critical to developing targeted intervention strategies and optimizing risk-based health care for cancer survivors."

    "content": "Purpose Childhood cancer survivors are at increased risk of subsequent neoplasms (SNs), but the germline genetic contribution is largely unknown. We assessed the contribution of pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) mutations in cancer predisposition genes to their SN risk. Patients and Methods Whole-genome sequencing (30-fold) was performed on samples from childhood cancer survivors who were \u2265 5 years since initial cancer diagnosis and participants in the St Jude Lifetime Cohort Study, a retrospective hospital-based study with prospective clinical follow-up. Germline mutations in 60 genes known to be associated with autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndromes with moderate to high penetrance were classified by their pathogenicity according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines. Relative rates (RRs) and 95% CIs of SN occurrence by mutation status were estimated using multivariable piecewise exponential regression stratified by radiation exposure. Results Participants were 3,006 survivors (53% male; median age, 35.8 years [range, 7.1 to 69.8 years]; 56% received radiotherapy), 1,120 SNs were diagnosed among 439 survivors (14.6%), and 175 P/LP mutations were identified in 5.8% (95% CI, 5.0% to 6.7%) of survivors. Mutations were associated with significantly increased rates of breast cancer (RR, 13.9; 95% CI, 6.0 to 32.2) and sarcoma (RR, 10.6; 95% CI, 4.3 to 26.3) among irradiated survivors and with increased rates of developing any SN (RR, 4.7; 95% CI, 2.4 to 9.3), breast cancer (RR, 7.7; 95% CI, 2.4 to 24.4), nonmelanoma skin cancer (RR, 11.0; 95% CI, 2.9 to 41.4), and two or more histologically distinct SNs (RR, 18.6; 95% CI, 3.5 to 99.3) among nonirradiated survivors. Conclusion The findings support referral of all survivors for genetic counseling for potential clinical genetic testing, which should be prioritized for nonirradiated survivors with any SN and for those with breast cancer or sarcoma in the field of prior irradiation."

    "content": "Cancer-related deaths over the next decade are expected to increase due to cancer screening deficits associated with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Although national deficits have been quantified, a structured response to identifying and addressing local deficits has not been widely available. The objectives of this report are to share preliminary data on monthly screening deficits in breast, colorectal, lung, and cervical cancers across diverse settings and to provide online materials from a national quality improvement (QI) study to help other institutions to address local screening deficits.This prospective, national QI study on Return-to-Screening enrolled 748 accredited cancer programs in the United States from April through June 2021. Local prepandemic and pandemic monthly screening test volumes (MTVs) were used to calculate the relative percent change in MTV to describe the monthly screening gap.The majority of facilities reported monthly screening deficits (colorectal cancer, 80.6% [n = 104/129]; cervical cancer, 69.0% [n = 20/29]; breast cancer, 55.3% [n = 241/436]; lung cancer, 44.6% [n = 98/220]). Overall, the median relative percent change in MTV ranged from -17.7% for colorectal cancer (interquartile range [IQR], -33.6% to -2.8%), -6.8% for cervical cancer (IQR, -29.4% to 1.7%), -1.6% for breast cancer (IQR, -9.6% to 7.0%), and 1.2% for lung cancer (IQR, -16.9% to 19.0%). Geographic differences were not observed. There were statistically significant differences in the percent change in MTV between institution types for colorectal cancer screening (P = .02).Cancer screening is still in need of urgent attention, and the screening resources made available online may help facilities to close critical gaps and address screenings missed in 2020.Question: How can the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on cancer screening be mitigated?When national resources were provided, including methods to calculate local screening deficits, 748 cancer programs promptly enrolled in a national Return-to-Screening study, and the majority identified local screening deficits, most notably in colorectal cancer. Using these results, 814 quality improvement projects were initiated with the potential to add 70,000 screening tests in 2021. Meaning: Cancer screening is still in need of urgent attention, and the online resources that we provide may help to close critical screening deficits."

    "content": "<b>Background</b>: We investigate the role of family history of cancer (FHC) and diagnosis of metachronous and/or synchronous multiple neoplasms (MN), during anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. <b>Design</b>: This was a multicenter retrospective study of advanced cancer patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. FHC was collected in lineal and collateral lines, and patients were categorized as follows: FHC-high (in case of cancer diagnoses in both the lineal and collateral family lines), FHC-low (in case of cancer diagnoses in only one family line), and FHC-negative. Patients were also categorized according to the diagnosis of MN as follows: MN-high (>2 malignancies), MN-low (two malignancies), and MN-negative. Objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and incidence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) of any grade were evaluated. <b>Results</b>: 822 consecutive patients were evaluated. 458 patients (55.7%) were FHC-negative, 289 (35.2%) were FHC-low, and 75 (9.1%) FHC-high, respectively. 29 (3.5%) had a diagnosis of synchronous MN and 94 (11.4%) of metachronous MN. 108 (13.2%) and 15 (1.8%) patients were MN-low and MN-high, respectively. The median follow-up was 15.6 months. No significant differences were found regarding ORR among subgroups. FHC-high patients had a significantly longer PFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.69 [95% CI: 0.48-0.97], <i>p</i> = .0379) and OS (HR = 0.61 [95% CI: 0.39-0.93], <i>p</i> = .0210), when compared to FHC-negative patients. FHC-high was confirmed as an independent predictor for PFS and OS at multivariate analysis. No significant differences were found according to MN categories. FHC-high patients had a significantly higher incidence of irAEs of any grade, compared to FHC-negative patients (<i>p</i> = .0012). <b>Conclusions</b>: FHC-high patients seem to benefit more than FHC-negative patients from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors."

    "content": "Malaria is associated with Burkitt lymphoma among children in Sub-Saharan Africa. No longitudinal studies have assessed the long-term risk of other lymphoma or cancer overall. Here, we investigated the risk of lymphoid neoplasms and other cancer after malaria.We included 4125 patients diagnosed with malaria in Sweden in 1987-2015, identified either through the National Surveillance Database at the Public Health Agency of Sweden, the National Inpatient and Outpatient Register, or by reports from microbiology departments. A comparator cohort (N\u2009=\u200966,997) matched on sex, age and birth region was retrieved from the general population and an additional cohort with all individuals born in Sub-Saharan Africa registered in the Total Population Register in 1987-2015 (N\u2009=\u2009171,756). Incident lymphomas and other cancers were identified through linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register. Hazard ratios (HRs) were assessed using Cox regression with attained age as the timescale.A total of 20 lymphoid neoplasms and 202 non-haematological cancers were identified among malaria patients during a mean follow-up of 13.3 and 13.7\u2009years, respectively. The overall risk of lymphoid neoplasms was not significantly increased (hazard ratio [HR] 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79-1.94), neither did we find any association with all-site non-haematological cancer (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77-1.02). However, in the Sub-Saharan Africa cohort, we observed an increased risk of lymphoid neoplasms after malaria diagnosis (HR 2.39, 95% CI 1.06-5.40), but no difference in the risk of other cancer (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.70-1.45). The association could not be explained by co-infection with HIV or chronic hepatitis B or C, since the risk estimate was largely unchanged after excluding patients with these comorbidities (HR 2.63, 95% CI 1.08-6.42). The risk became more pronounced when restricting analyses to only including non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphomas (HR 3.49, 95% CI 1.42-8.56).Individuals born in malaria-endemic areas and diagnosed with malaria in Sweden had an increased risk of lymphoid neoplasms, especially B cell lymphoma. There was no association with cancer overall nor did single malaria episodes confer an increased risk in travellers."

    "content": "Cancer survivors receive more long-term opioid therapy (LTOT) than people without cancer, but the safety of LTOT prescribing is unknown.Opioid-naive adults aged \u226566 years who had been diagnosed in 2008-2015 with breast, lung, head and neck, or colorectal cancer were identified with data from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registries linked with Medicare claims. Survivors with 1 or more LTOT episodes (\u226590 consecutive days) occurring \u22651 year after their cancer diagnosis and before censoring at hospice entry, another cancer diagnosis, 6 months before death, or December 2016 were included. The safety of prescribing during the first 90 days of the first LTOT episode was measured during follow-up. As a positive safety indicator, the proportion of survivors with concurrent nonopioid pain management was measured. Indicators of less safe prescribing were the proportion of survivors with a high average daily opioid dose (\u226590 morphine milligram equivalents) and the proportion of survivors with concurrent benzodiazepine dispensing. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify clinical predictors of each safety outcome.In all, 3628 cancer survivors received LTOT during follow-up (median duration, 4.9 months; interquartile range, 3.5-8.0 months). Seventy-two percent of the survivors received multimodal pain management concurrently with LTOT. Eight percent of the survivors had high-dose opioid prescriptions; 25% of the survivors received benzodiazepines during LTOT. Multivariable analyses identified variations in safety measures by multiple clinical factors, although none were consistently significant across outcomes.To improve safe LTOT prescribing for survivors, efforts should focus on increasing multimodal pain management and reducing inappropriate benzodiazepine prescribing. Different clinical predictors of each outcome suggest different drivers of safe prescribing."

    "title": "HRD1 in human malignant neoplasms: Molecular mechanisms and novel therapeutic strategy for cancer.",
    "content": "In tumor cells, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays an essential role in maintaining cellular proteostasis by stimulating unfolded protein response (UPR) underlying stress conditions. ER-associated degradation (ERAD) is a critical pathway of the UPR to protect cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis and the elimination of unfolded or misfolded proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl reductase degradation (HRD1) as an E3 ubiquitin ligase plays an essential role in the ubiquitination and dislocation of misfolded protein in ERAD. In addition, HRD1 can target other normal folded proteins. In various types of cancer, the expression of HRD1 is dysregulated, and it targets different molecules to develop cancer hallmarks or suppress the progression of the disease. Recent investigations have defined the role of HRD1 in drug resistance in types of cancer. This review focuses on the molecular mechanisms of HRD1 and its roles in cancer pathogenesis and discusses the worthiness of targeting HRD1 as a novel therapeutic strategy in cancer."

    "content": "Few studies have investigated the risks of subsequent primary neoplasms after adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer. We investigated the risks of specific subsequent primary neoplasms after each of 16 types of AYA cancer.The Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Survivor Study is a population-based cohort of 200\u2008945 survivors of cancer diagnosed when aged 15-39 years in England and Wales from Jan 1, 1971, to Dec 31, 2006. The cohort was established using cancer registrations from the Office for National Statistics and the Welsh Cancer registry. Follow-up was from 5-year survival until the first occurrence of death, emigration, or study end date (Dec 31, 2012). In this analysis, we focus on the risk of specific subsequent primary neoplasms after 16 types of AYA cancer: breast; cervical; testicular; Hodgkin lymphoma (female); Hodgkin lymphoma (male); melanoma; CNS (intracranial); colorectal; non-Hodgkin lymphoma; thyroid; soft-tissue sarcoma; ovarian; bladder; other female genital; leukaemia; and head and neck cancer. We report absolute excess risks (AERs; per 10\u2008000 person-years) and cumulative incidence of specific types of subsequent primary neoplasm after each type of AYA cancer.During the 2\u2008631\u2008326 person-years of follow-up (median follow-up 16\u00b78 years, IQR 10\u00b75-25\u00b72), 12\u2008321 subsequent primary neoplasms were diagnosed in 11\u2008565 survivors, most frequently among survivors of breast cancer, cervical cancer, testicular cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma. AERs of any subsequent primary neoplasms were 19\u00b75 per 10\u2008000 person-years (95% CI 17\u00b74-21\u00b75) in survivors of breast cancer, 10\u00b72 (8\u00b70-12\u00b74) in survivors of cervical cancer, 18\u00b79 (16\u00b76-21\u00b71) in survivors of testicular cancer, 55\u00b77 (50\u00b74-61\u00b71) in female survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, and 29\u00b79 (26\u00b73-33\u00b76) in male survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma. The cumulative incidence of all subsequent primary neoplasms 35 years after diagnosis was 11\u00b79% (95% CI 11\u00b73-12\u00b76) in survivors of breast cancer, 15\u00b78% (14\u00b78-16\u00b77) in survivors of cervical cancer, 20\u00b72% (18\u00b79-21\u00b75) in survivors of testicular cancer, 26\u00b76% (24\u00b77-28\u00b76) in female survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, and 16\u00b75% (15\u00b72-18\u00b70) in male survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma. In patients who had survived at least 30 years from diagnosis of cervical cancer, testicular cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma in women, breast cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma in men, we identified a small number of specific subsequent primary neoplasms that account for 82%, 61%, 58%, 45%, and 41% of the total excess number of neoplasms, respectively. Lung cancer accounted for a notable proportion of the excess number of neoplasms across all AYA groups investigated.Our finding that a small number of specific subsequent primary neoplasms account for a large percentage of the total excess number of neoplasms in long-term survivors of cervical, breast, and testicular cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma provides an evidence base to inform priorities for clinical long-term follow-up. The prominence of lung cancer after each of these AYA cancers indicates the need for further work aimed at preventing and reducing the burden of this cancer in future survivors of AYA cancer.Cancer Research UK, National Institute for Health Research, Academy of Medical Sciences, and Children with Cancer UK."

    "content": "The majority of JAK2<sup>V617F</sup>-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) have disease-initiating frameshift mutations in calreticulin (<i>CALR</i>), resulting in a common carboxyl-terminal mutant fragment (CALR<sup>MUT</sup>), representing an attractive source of neoantigens for cancer vaccines. However, studies have shown that CALR<sup>MUT</sup>-specific T cells are rare in patients with CALR<sup>MUT</sup> MPN for unknown reasons. We examined class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I) allele frequencies in patients with CALR<sup>MUT</sup> MPN from two independent cohorts. We observed that MHC-I alleles that present CALR<sup>MUT</sup> neoepitopes with high affinity are underrepresented in patients with CALR<sup>MUT</sup> MPN. We speculated that this was due to an increased chance of immune-mediated tumor rejection by individuals expressing one of these MHC-I alleles such that the disease never clinically manifested. As a consequence of this MHC-I allele restriction, we reasoned that patients with CALR<sup>MUT</sup> MPN would not efficiently respond to a CALR<sup>MUT</sup> fragment cancer vaccine but would when immunized with a modified CALR<sup>MUT</sup> heteroclitic peptide vaccine approach. We found that heteroclitic CALR<sup>MUT</sup> peptides specifically designed for the MHC-I alleles of patients with CALR<sup>MUT</sup> MPN efficiently elicited a CALR<sup>MUT</sup> cross-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response in human peripheral blood samples but not to the matched weakly immunogenic CALR<sup>MUT</sup> native peptides. We corroborated this effect in vivo in mice and observed that C57BL/6J mice can mount a CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response to the CALR<sup>MUT</sup> fragment upon immunization with a CALR<sup>MUT</sup> heteroclitic, but not native, peptide. Together, our data emphasize the therapeutic potential of heteroclitic peptide-based cancer vaccines in patients with CALR<sup>MUT</sup> MPN."

    "content": "Health outcomes of children in families affected by cancer are poorly understood. The authors assessed the risk of hospitalization in children who have a sibling with cancer.This was a longitudinal cohort study in which 1600 children who had a sibling with cancer were matched to 32,000 children who had unaffected siblings in Quebec, Canada, from 2006 to 2020. The exposure of interest was having a sibling with cancer. Outcomes included hospitalization for pneumonia, asthma, fracture, and other morbidities any time after the sibling was diagnosed with cancer. The children were followed over time, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the impact of having a sibling with cancer on the risk of hospitalization before age 14 years, adjusted for patient characteristics.Children who had a sibling with cancer had an increased risk of hospitalization compared with unaffected children (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.29). Conditions associated with a greater risk of hospitalization included pneumonia, hemangioma, other skin conditions, sleep apnea, and inflammatory bowel disease. The risk of hospitalization was greatest for children whose older sibling had cancer (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.01-1.32) and for children whose sibling had hematopoietic cancer (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.01-1.48).Children who have a sibling with cancer are at risk of hospitalization for conditions such as pneumonia, inflammatory bowel disease, and other morbidities. Families affected by childhood cancer may benefit from additional support to facilitate care for all children in the family.Little is known about the health of children who have a brother or sister with cancer. The authors studied the types of hospitalization experienced by children who have siblings with cancer. The results indicated that having a sibling with cancer increased the chance of being hospitalized for pneumonia and other conditions that could have been preventable. The results also indicated that children who had an older sibling with cancer or a sibling with blood cancer had a greater chance of being hospitalized. The findings highlight the importance of providing timely care for children in families affected by childhood cancer."

    "content": "The Childhood Cancer Research Network (CCRN) was established by the Children's Oncology Group (COG) as a resource for epidemiologic studies of childhood cancer. The objective of this study was to evaluate the representativeness of CCRN and identify factors associated with enrollment.The number of US childhood patients with cancer diagnosed <20 years of age enrolled in CCRN (2008-2015) was compared to expected counts, calculated from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results incidence rates and US Census population estimates. Observed-to-expected ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated across sex, race, diagnosis age, calendar year, and cancer diagnosis groups. Multivariable linear regression models were generated to evaluate the association between open COG phase 3 therapeutic trials and CCRN enrollment rates.The 43,110 cases enrolled in CCRN represented 36% of the expected childhood cancers diagnosed from 2008 to 2015 (N = 120,118). CCRN enrollment ratios [95% CI] were highest among males (0.38 [95% CI, 0.37-0.38]), non-Hispanics (0.35 [95% CI, 0.35-0.36]), and those diagnosed from 1 to 4 years of age (0.50 [95% CI, 0.50-51]). Enrollment ratios varied by diagnosis group, with leukemia, myeloproliferative diseases, myelodysplastic diseases (0.55 [95% CI, 0.54-0.55]), and renal tumors (0.55 [95% CI, 0.53-0.58]) having the highest enrollment. After adjusting for year of diagnosis and cancer diagnosis, there was a 3.1% [95% CI, 0.6-5.6%] increase in CCRN enrollment during windows of open COG therapeutic trials.Despite enrolling only 36% of newly diagnosed cases, CCRN remains a valuable resource for investigators conducting childhood cancer etiology and survivorship research. The results of this study may inform efforts to improve enrollment on current and future COG nontherapeutic registry protocols."

Bootstrapping approach and competing-risk proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the effect of RT on nonbreast SMN risk. The analysis was repeated in racial subgroups. Radiotolerance score analysis of normal airway epithelium was performed using Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data sets.Within records of 30,003 women with primary breast cancer, 20,516 eligible patients were identified, including 2,183 African Americans (AAs) and 16,009 Caucasians. The 25-year cumulative incidences of SMN were 5.2% and 3.6% (RT vs no-RT) for AAs, with 12.8-year and 17.4-year (RT vs no-RT) median follow-up (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.81; 95% bootstrapping confidence interval [BCI], 1.02-2.50; P < .05), respectively, and 6.4% and 5.9% (RT vs no-RT) for Caucasians with 14.3-year and\u00a018.1-year (RT vs no-RT) median follow-up (HR = 1.10; 95% BCI, 0.61-1.40; P > .05), respectively. The largest portion of excess RT-related SMN risk was lung cancer (AA: HR = 2.08, 95% BCI, 1.02-5.39, P < .05; Caucasian: HR = 1.50, 95% BCI, 0.84-5.38, P > .05). Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plot (STEPP) analysis revealed higher\u00a0post-RT nonbreast SMN risk in those 20 to 44 years of age, with larger HRs for RT in AAs. Radiotolerance score (RTS) of normal airway epithelium from young AA women was significantly lower than that from young Caucasian women (P = .038).With a projected 25-year follow-up, RT is associated with elevated risk of nonbreast SMNs, particularly second lung cancer, in young women survivors of stage I-IIIA breast cancer. Nonbreast SMNs associated with RT are higher in AA women than Caucasian women."

    "content": "This study evaluated the association between preexisting stress-related diagnoses and mortality in a Danish population-based cancer cohort.This study included Danish patients with cancer diagnosed in 1995-2011 who had a stress-related diagnosis before their cancer diagnosis. Cancer patients without a prior stress-related diagnosis were matched 5:1 to the stress disorder cohort by cancer site, age group, calendar period, and sex. The 5-year cumulative incidence of cancer-specific and all-cause mortality was computed by stress-related diagnosis category. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) associating stress-related diagnoses with mortality were computed by follow-up time, stress-related diagnosis category, stage, comorbidity status, and cancer type.This study identified 4437 cancer patients with a preexisting stress-related diagnosis and 22,060 matched cancer cohort members. The 5-year cumulative risk of cancer-specific mortality was 33% (95% CI, 32%-35%) for those with a preexisting stress-related diagnosis and 29% (95% CI, 28%-29%) for those without a prior stress-related diagnosis. Cancer patients with a preexisting stress-related diagnosis had a 1.3 times higher cancer-specific mortality rate than the comparison cohort members (95% CI, 1.2-1.5). This increase persisted across categories of stress-related diagnosis. The association varied by stage and cancer type, with more pronounced associations found among those with a late stage at diagnosis and hematological malignancies.Cancer patients with preexisting stress-related diagnoses had increased rates of cancer-specific and all-cause mortality. The results suggest that psychiatric comorbidities may be an important consideration for cancer prognosis, and cancer treatment informed by a patient's history may improve outcomes."

    "content": "Cancer prevalence is heterogeneous because it includes individuals who are undergoing initial treatment and those who are in remission, experiencing relapse, or cured. The proposed statistical approach describes the health status of this group by estimating the probabilities of death among prevalent cases. The application concerns colorectal, lung, breast, and prostate cancers and melanoma in France in 2017.Excess mortality was used to estimate the probabilities of death from cancer and other causes.For the studied cancers, most deaths from cancer occurred during the first 5\u2009years after diagnosis. The probability of death from cancer decreased with increasing time since diagnosis except for breast cancer, for which it remained relatively stable. The time beyond which the probability of death from cancer became lower than that from other causes depended on age and cancer site: for colorectal cancer, it was 6\u2009years after diagnosis for women (7\u2009years for men) aged 75-84 and 20\u2009years for women (18\u2009years for men) aged 45-54\u2009years, whereas cancer was the major cause of death for women younger than 75\u2009years whatever the time since diagnosis for breast and for all patients younger than 75\u2009years for lung cancer. In contrast, deaths from other causes were more frequent in all the patients older than 75\u2009years. Apart from breast cancer in women younger than 55\u2009years and lung cancer in women older than 55\u2009years and men older than 65\u2009years, the probability of death from cancer among prevalent cases fell below 1%, with varying times since diagnosis.The authors' approach can be used to better describe the burden of cancer by estimating outcomes in prevalent cases."

    "content": "Cancer-related fatigue is a debilitating late effect after treatment for childhood cancer. The prevalence of fatigue in childhood cancer survivors (CCSs) and associated factors for fatigue has varied widely in previous studies. Two important aspects of cancer-related fatigue, its severity and chronicity, are often not assessed. This study investigated the prevalence of, and risk factors for, severe chronic fatigue (CF) in a national cohort of Dutch CCSs.In this study, 2810 CCSs (5-year survivors of all childhood malignancies diagnosed between 1963 and 2001 with a current age of 12-65 years) and 1040 sibling controls were included. CF was assessed with the Short Fatigue Questionnaire and was defined as a score \u2265 18 and persistence of fatigue for \u22656 months. Cancer- and treatment-related characteristics, current health problems, and demographic and lifestyle variables were assessed as potential risk factors for CF via multivariable logistic regression analyses.In adult CCSs and sibling controls (\u226518 years old), the prevalence of CF was 26.1% and 14.1%, respectively (P < .001). In adolescent CCSs and sibling controls (<18 years old), the prevalence of CF was 10.9% and 3.2%, respectively. Female gender (odds ratio [OR], 2.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.73-2.62), unemployment (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.67-2.85), having 1 or more health problems (OR for 1-2, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.18-1.87; OR for >2, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.50-3.21), and a central nervous system diagnosis (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.17-2.60) were significantly associated with CF in adult CCSs.This study shows that CCSs, regardless of their cancer diagnosis, report CF more often than sibling controls. This study provides new evidence for the prevalence of fatigue in CCSs."

    "title": "Cardiometabolic risk factors and survival after cancer in the Women's Health Initiative.",
    "content": "Cardiometabolic abnormalities are a leading cause of death among women, including women with cancer.This study examined the association between prediagnosis cardiovascular health and total and cause-specific mortality among 12,076 postmenopausal women who developed local- or regional-stage invasive cancer in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). Cardiovascular risk factors included waist circumference, hypertension, high cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes. Obesity-related cancers included breast cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, kidney cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for important predictors of survival.After a median follow-up of 10.0 years from the date of the cancer diagnosis, there were 3607 total deaths, with 1546 (43%) due to cancer. Most participants (62.9%) had 1 or 2 cardiometabolic risk factors, and 8.1% had 3 or 4. In adjusted models, women with 3 to 4 risk factors (vs none) had a higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.73-2.30), death due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) (HR, 4.01; 95% CI, 2.88-5.57), cancer-specific mortality (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.1-1.72), and other-cause mortality (HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.70-2.69). A higher waist circumference was associated with greater all-cause mortality (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.06-1.30) and cancer-specific mortality (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.04-1.42).Among postmenopausal women diagnosed with cancer in the WHI, cardiometabolic risk factors before the cancer diagnosis were associated with greater all-cause, CVD, cancer-specific, and other-cause mortality. These results raise hypotheses regarding potential clinical intervention strategies targeting cardiometabolic abnormalities that require future prospective studies for confirmation.This study uses information from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) to find out whether cardiac risk factors are related to a greater risk of dying among older women with cancer. The WHI is the largest study of medical problems faced by older women in this country. The results show that women who have 3 or 4 risk factors are more likely to die of any cause, heart disease, or cancer in comparison with women with no risk factors. It is concluded that interventions to help to lower the burden of cardiac risk factors can have an important impact on survivorship among women with cancer."

    "title": "Somatic and Germline <i>TP53</i> Alterations in Second Malignant Neoplasms from Pediatric Cancer Survivors.",
    "content": "<b>Purpose:</b> Second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) are severe late complications that occur in pediatric cancer survivors exposed to radiotherapy and other genotoxic treatments. To characterize the mutational landscape of treatment-induced sarcomas and to identify candidate SMN-predisposing variants, we analyzed germline and SMN samples from pediatric cancer survivors.<b>Experimental Design:</b> We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing on radiation-induced sarcomas arising from two pediatric cancer survivors. To assess the frequency of germline <i>TP53</i> variants in SMNs, Sanger sequencing was performed to analyze germline <i>TP53</i> in 37 pediatric cancer survivors from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) without any history of a familial cancer predisposition syndrome but known to have developed SMNs.<b>Results:</b> WES revealed <i>TP53</i> mutations involving p53's DNA-binding domain in both index cases, one of which was also present in the germline. The germline and somatic <i>TP53-</i>mutant variants were enriched in the transcriptomes for both sarcomas. Analysis of <i>TP53-</i>coding exons in germline specimens from the CCSS survivor cohort identified a G215C variant encoding an R72P amino acid substitution in 6 patients and a synonymous SNP A639G in 4 others, resulting in 10 of 37 evaluable patients (27%) harboring a germline <i>TP53</i> variant.<b>Conclusions:</b> Currently, germline <i>TP53</i> is not routinely assessed in patients with pediatric cancer. These data support the concept that identifying germline <i>TP53</i> variants at the time a primary cancer is diagnosed may identify patients at high risk for SMN development, who could benefit from modified therapeutic strategies and/or intensive posttreatment monitoring. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 23(7); 1852-61. \u00a92016 AACR</i>."

    "content": "Assessing quality of life is essential for individuals with advanced cancer, but lengthy assessments can be burdensome. The authors investigated the psychometric characteristics of the FACT-G7, a 7-item quality-of-life measure derived from the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) scale, in advanced cancer.Data were obtained from outpatients with advanced cancer who were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of early palliative care. At baseline, 228 intervention participants and 233 control participants (N\u00a0=\u00a0461) completed the FACT-G and measures of symptom severity, quality of life near the end of life, problematic medical communication, and satisfaction with care. Follow-up measures were administered monthly for 4\u00a0months.The FACT-G7 showed good internal consistency (Cronbach \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a0.72-.80), and its single-factor structure was supported. It correlated strongly with the FACT-G total, physical, and functional indices and with symptom severity (absolute r\u00a0=\u00a00.73-0.92); more moderately with the FACT-G emotional index and with symptom impact and preparation for the end of life (r\u00a0=\u00a0.40-.71); and least with the FACT-G social/family index and with relationship with health care provider, life completion, problematic medical communication, and care satisfaction measures (absolute r\u00a0=\u00a0.26-.44). Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status groups differed on FACT-G7 scores, as expected (all P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Improvements in FACT-G7 scores in the intervention group compared with the control group at 3-month (P\u00a0=\u00a0.049) and 4-month (P\u00a0=\u00a0.034) follow-up supported responsiveness to change and somewhat greater sensitivity than the FACT-G scores.The FACT-G7 is a valid, brief measure particularly of the physical and functional facets of quality of life. It may enable rapid quality-of-life assessments in patients with advanced cancer."

    "title": "Suicide risk among cancer survivors: Head and neck versus other cancers.",
    "content": "Cancer survivors face psychosocial issues that increase their risk of suicide. This study examined the risk of suicide across cancer sites, with a focus on survivors of head and neck cancer (HNC).The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 18-registry database (from 2000 to 2014) was queried for the top 20 cancer sites in the database, including HNC. The outcome of interest was suicide as a cause of death. The mortality rate from suicide was estimated for HNC sites and was compared with rates for 19 other cancer sites that were included in the study. Poisson regression was used to estimate adjusted rate ratios (aRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 1) HNC versus non-HNC sites (the other 19 cancer sites combined), and 2) HNC versus each individual cancer site. Models were stratified by sex, controlling for race, marital status, age, year, and stage at diagnosis.There were 404 suicides among 151,167 HNC survivors from 2000 to 2014, yielding a suicide rate of 63.4 suicides per 100,000 person-years. In this timeframe, there were 4493 suicides observed among 4219,097 cancer survivors in the study sample, yielding an incidence rate of 23.6 suicides per 100,000 person-years. Compared with survivors of other cancers, survivors of HNC were almost 2 times more likely to die from suicide (aRR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.77-2.19). There was a 27% increase in the risk of suicide among HNC survivors during the period from 2010 to 2014 (aRR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.16-1.38) compared with the period from 2000 to 2004.Although survival rates in cancer have improved because of improved treatments, the risk of death by suicide remains a problem for cancer survivors, particularly those with HNC."

    "content": "Five-year relative survival for adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with cancer diagnosed at the ages of 15 to 39 years is 85%. Survival rates vary considerably according to the cancer type. The purpose of this study was to analyze long-term survival trends for cancer types with the highest mortality among AYAs to determine where the greatest burden is and to identify areas for future research.Using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry and the National Center for Health Statistics, the authors examined the incidence, mortality, and survival for the 9 cancer types with the highest mortality rates in this age group from 1975 to 2016. JPSurv, new survival trend software, was used in the analysis.Results suggested significant improvements in 5-year relative survival for brain and other nervous system tumors, colon and rectum cancer, lung and bronchus cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (all P values < .05). Limited or no improvement in survival was found for female breast cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, and bone and joint sarcomas.Five-year relative survival for multiple cancer types in AYAs has improved, but some common cancer types in this group still show limited survival improvements (eg, ovarian cancer). Survival improvements in colorectal cancer have been overshadowed by its rising incidence, which suggests a substantial disease burden. Future research should focus on female breast, bone, ovarian, and cervical cancers, which have seen minimal or no improvements in survival.Survival trends for adolescents and young adults with cancer are presented from a 40-year period. Although survival progress is noted for brain cancer, lung cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and colon and rectum cancer, the incidence of colon and rectum cancer remains high. Minimal progress is evident for female breast, bone, ovarian, and cervical cancers, which are in need of renewed focus."

It is not clear whether patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), which are precursors to some pancreatic cancers, also carry these mutations. We assessed the prevalence of germline mutations associated with cancer risk in patients with histologically confirmed IPMN.We obtained nontumor tissue samples from 315 patients with surgically resected IPMNs from 1997 through 2017, and we sequenced 94 genes with variants associated with cancer risk. Mutations associated with increased risk of cancer were identified and compared with individuals from the Exome Aggregation Consortium.We identified 23 patients with a germline mutation associated with cancer risk (7.3%; 95% confidence interval, 4.9-10.8). Nine patients had a germline mutation associated with pancreatic cancer susceptibility (2.9%; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-5.4). More patients with IPMNs carried germline mutations in ATM (P < .0001), PTCH1 (P < .0001), and SUFU (P < .0001) compared with controls. Patients with IPMNs and germline mutations associated with pancreatic cancer were more like to have concurrent invasive pancreatic carcinoma compared with patients with IPMNs without these mutations (P < .0320).In sequence analyses of 315 patients with surgically resected IPMNs, we found that almost 3% to carry mutations associated with pancreatic cancer risk. More patients with IPMNs and germline mutations associated with pancreatic cancer had concurrent invasive pancreatic carcinoma compared with patients with IPMNs without these mutations. Genetic analysis of patients with IPMNs might identify those at greatest risk for cancer."

This study assessed MH service use and unmet service needs among a nationally representative sample of cancer survivors.Respondents aged 18 to 64\u00a0years were identified from the 2015-2018 National Survey of Drug Use and Health data. Outcomes assessed past-year MH service use and self-reported unmet MH needs. Outcomes were compared between respondents who reported a cancer history (survivors) and those who did not (controls), descriptively and in adjusted analyses controlling for sociodemographic factors and health status. Analyses were stratified by age groups (18-34, 35-49, and 50-64\u00a0years).Comparing 3540 survivors with 149,843 controls, within each age group, a higher proportion of survivors than controls received any MH service (P values\u00a0<\u00a0.05); this difference persisted among those aged 35 to 49\u00a0years (P\u00a0=\u00a0.004) in fully adjusted models. Moreover, a higher proportion of survivors than controls reported an unmet need for MH care; this difference was larger among young adults aged 18 to 34\u00a0years (20.8% vs 9.0%; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) than those aged 35 to 49\u00a0years (9.4% vs 5.3%; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and 50 to 64\u00a0years (4.8% vs 3.4%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.029). In fully adjusted models, the survivor-control difference in self-reported unmet MH needs persisted among young adults (24% relative increase; P\u00a0=\u00a0.023). Among cancer survivors, young adult survivors had the highest likelihood of reporting unmet MH needs.This nationally representative study found an increased perception of unmet needs for MH care among cancer survivors, particularly among young adult survivors, compared with the general population without cancer."

    "content": "Curative therapy places childhood cancer survivors at increased risk for second primary malignancies (SPMs). However, there have been few population-based attempts to characterize differences between outcomes of SPMs in childhood cancer survivors and outcomes of first primary malignancies (FPMs).Clinical and demographic information about childhood cancer survivors who developed SPMs and individuals with comparable FPMs was extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated with Cox proportional hazards models comparing the overall survival (OS) of individuals with and without a history of childhood cancer. OS was evaluated both overall and for specific cancers diagnosed in 50 or more childhood cancer survivors. Models accounted for potential confounders, including sex, race, age, treatment decade, histology, and disease stage.Compared with individuals with FPMs (n\u00a0=\u00a01,332,203), childhood cancer survivors (n\u00a0=\u00a01409) with an SPM experienced poorer OS (HR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.72-2.02) after the study had accounted for cancer type, age, sex, race, and decade of diagnosis. A history of childhood cancer remained a poor prognostic factor for all specific cancers evaluated, including breast cancer (HR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.63-2.62), thyroid cancer (HR, 3.59; 95% CI, 2.08-6.19), acute myeloid leukemia (HR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.87-3.05), brain cancer (HR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.72-2.55), melanoma (HR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.55-4.27), bone cancer (HR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.37-2.57), and soft-tissue sarcoma (HR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.78-3.33).Compared with individuals without a prior cancer diagnosis, survivors of childhood cancer with an SPM experienced inferior outcomes.

The relative risk of death after a pediatric cancer diagnosis versus the general population and the risk of death from a primary cancer diagnosis versus competing causes of death.This retrospective, population-based study used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (1980-2015) and included patients aged 0 to 19\u00a0years at the time of diagnosis. Observed deaths were calculated; the risk of death versus the general population was assessed with standardized mortality ratios (SMRs). Competing risk models for the cause of death were performed.There were 58,356 patients who were diagnosed, and the mortality rate was 22.8%. To assess causes of death, 6996 patients who died during the study period were included (45,580 total person-years at risk): 5128 (73%) died of their primary cancer, and 1868 (27%) died of a competing cause. Among all patients, the rate of death from the index cancer was higher than the rate of death from another cause within the first 5\u00a0years after diagnosis. The risk of death from a nonprimary cancer began to supersede the rate of death from the primary cancer 10\u00a0years after diagnosis for patients with germ cell tumors, lymphomas, and sarcomas. SMRs for the primary cancer were highest within the first 5\u00a0years after diagnosis for all cancers (SMRs, 100-50,000; P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). The risk of death from competing causes (heart disease, suicide, and sepsis) was elevated (SMR, >100; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). The risk of dying of heart disease was high, especially for patients with astrocytomas (SMR, 47.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 27.87-76.59) and neuroblastomas (SMR, 98.59; 95% CI, 47.28-181.32).

Multiple logistic regression was estimated to compare outcomes between 832 AYAs who reported a cancer history (survivors) and 140,826 AYAs who did not, adjusting sequentially for sociodemographic characteristics and health status.In regressions adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, survivors were more likely than a noncancer comparison group of peers to use alcohol (6% relative increase; P = .048) and illicit drugs (34% relative increase; P = .012), to misuse prescription opioids (59% relative increase; P < .001), and to have a marijuana (67% relative increase; P = .011), illicit drug (77% relative increase; P < .001), or prescription opioid (67% relative increase; P = .048) SUD. When further adjusting for health status, survivors were still 41% more likely (P < .001) to misuse prescription opioids than noncancer peers. Among those with SUDs, survivors were more likely than peers to receive treatment (unadjusted, 21.5% vs 8.0%; adjusted, P < .05).AYA survivors were as likely as or more likely than noncancer peers to report substance use problems. These findings underscore the importance of interventions to reduce substance use and improve SUD treatment among AYA cancer survivors.The authors assessed substance use, misuse, and substance use disorders, as well as the receipt of treatment for substance use disorders, among adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors. In a nationally representative AYA sample, cancer survivors, despite their increased risk for morbidity and early mortality, were as likely as or more likely than peers without cancer to experience substance use problems. In particular, survivors had a significantly higher rate of prescription opioid misuse than peers. However, only 1 in 5 AYA survivors who experienced substance use disorders received treatment. These findings underscore the importance of interventions toward reducing substance use and improving access to treatment among AYA survivors."

Little is known about the experiences of patients with advanced cancer using opioids in the context of the epidemic.Semistructured interviews of 26 patients with advanced cancer were conducted between May 2019 and April 2020; their experiences self-managing chronic pain with opioids were evaluated.Patients consistently described the negative impact of the opioid epidemic on their ability to self-manage pain. Negative media coverage and personal experiences with the epidemic promoted stigma, fear, and guilt surrounding opioid use. As a result, many patients delayed initiating opioids and often viewed their decision to take opioids as a moral failure-as \"caving in.\" Patients frequently managed this internal conflict through opioid-restricting behaviors (eg, skipping or taking lower doses). Stigma also impeded patient-clinician communication; patients often avoided discussing opioids or purposely conveyed underusing them to avoid being labeled a \"pill seeker.\" Patients experienced structural barriers to obtaining opioids such as prior authorizations, delays in refills, or being questioned by pharmacists about their opioid use. Barriers were stressful, amplified stigma, interfered with pain control, and reinforced ambivalence about opioids.The US opioid epidemic has stigmatized opioid use and undermined pain management in individuals with advanced cancer. Interventions seeking to alleviate cancer pain should attend to the multiple, negative influences of the opioid crisis on patients' ability to self-manage.Patients with advanced cancer suffer from significant pain and frequently receive opioids to manage their pain. Of the 26 patients with advanced cancer interviewed, the majority of patients experienced stigma about their opioid use for cancer pain management. All patients felt that the opioid epidemic fostered this stigma. Several struggled to use opioids for pain because of this stigma and the logistical complications they experienced with pharmacies and insurance coverage. Many were afraid to share their concerns about opioids with their providers. \u200b."

The objective of this study was to determine whether Holocaust survivors had an increased risk for developing cancer.The study population included 152,622 survivors. The main analysis was based on a comparison between individuals who were entitled to compensation for suffering persecution during the war and individuals who were denied such compensation. A complementary analysis compared survivors who were born in countries governed by Nazi Germany with survivors born in nonoccupied countries. A Cox proportional hazards model was used, with the time at risk of cancer development starting on either January 1, 1960, or the date of immigration to the date of cancer diagnosis or death or the date of last follow-up (December 31, 2006).Cancer was diagnosed in 22.2% of those who were granted compensation versus 16% of those who were denied compensation (P < .0001). Adjusting for birth cohort, sex, country of origin, and period of immigration, both analyses revealed significant increased risks of developing cancer in those who were exposed. For those who were granted versus denied compensation, the hazard ratios were 1.06 (P < .001) for all sites, 1.12 (P = .07) for colorectal cancer, and 1.37 (P = .008) for lung cancer. For those born in occupied countries versus nonoccupied countries, the hazard ratios were 1.08 (P < .001), 1.08 (P = .003), and 1.12 (P = .02), respectively.The current results, based on a large cohort of Holocaust survivors who were exposed to a variety of severe deprivations, add to the conflicting and sparse knowledge on this issue and support the notion that this group has a small but consistent increase in cancer development.

Women and patients experiencing an adjustment in oncology practice had a higher odds of PTSD (odds ratio= 2.10 [95% CI, 1.07-4.14] and 1.65 [95% CI, 1.03-2.63]; P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). PTSD symptoms were correlated with worse scores for QoL, cognition, and insomnia.Twenty-one percent of patients with cancer experienced PTSD symptoms associated with poor QoL during the first COVID-19-induced lockdown. Medical oncology practice was adjusted in approximately one-quarter of patients and was associated with the occurrence of PTSD symptoms. Psychosocial support should be offered in cancer centers to promote emotional resilience and avoid PTSD symptoms in patients."

    "title": "Clinical characteristics and prognostic analysis of multiple primary malignant neoplasms in patients with lung cancer.",
    "content": "Retrospective analysis of data from 14,528 lung cancer patients with multiple primary malignant neoplasm (MPMN) revealed that 2.5% (364/14,528) were MPMN cases and 96.2% (350/364) were diagnosed with two primary malignancies, 3.6% (13/364) with three primary malignancies, and 0.3% (1/364) with four primary malignancies. Among 350 lung cancer patients diagnosed with two primary malignancies, 26.6% (93/350) had lung cancer diagnosed first (LCF) and 73.4% (257/350) had other cancers diagnosed initially (OCF), whereas synchronous MPMN (SMPMN) accounted for 21.1% (74/350) and metachronous MPMN (MMPMN) accounted for 78.9% (276/350) of the cases. Detection of first primary neoplasms were at an early stage for LCF patients and the age of the first lung cancer diagnosis was 59.3 years vs. 55.4 years in the OCF group (P\u2009=\u20090.008), whereas the onset age of second primary neoplasm diagnosis was similar in both groups (62.5 and 61.6 years, P\u2009=\u20090.544). Median survival times of MMPMN and SMPMN patients in the LCF group were 6.83 and 2.42 years and in the OCF group 8.67 years and 2.25 years, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that SMPMN, LCF and the age of the primary cancer diagnosed first (\u2009\u2265\u200960 years) and NSCL staging\u2009 >\u2009II were significant independent factors for inferior prognosis of patients."

    "content": "Adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with cancer have not seen the same improvements in survival as younger (pediatric) patients and older patients (adults 40 years old or older). This may be related to their lower participation in clinical trials.This study examined AYA patient accrual to SWOG Cancer Research Network phase 1 to 3 clinical treatment trials for 29 cancers over 25 years (January 1996 to December 2020). Trial enrollments for AYA patients (15-39 years old) were compared with trial enrollments for older patients (40 years old or older) in SWOG and with US AYA cancer population rates derived from US Census and National Cancer Institute/Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data.In total, 84,219 patients were enrolled in SWOG treatment trials, including 7109 AYA patients (8.4%); in contrast, AYAs constituted 3.8% of the US cancer population. By histology, the highest proportions of AYA patients were in trials for Hodgkin disease (825 of 1220; 67.6%) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (350 of 678; 51.6%), whereas breast cancer trials had the greatest number of AYA patients (3032 of 32,693; 9.3%). SWOG AYA patients were more often female (68.8% vs 58.7%; P < .001), Black (10.1% vs 8.2%; P < .001), and Hispanic (10.6% vs 5.6%; P < .001) than SWOG patients who were 40 years old or older, and they were more often female (68.8% vs 65.1%; P < .001) but less often Black (10.1% vs 11.8%; P < .001) or Hispanic (10.6% vs 12.8%; P < .001) than AYA patients in the US cancer population.AYA patients with cancer were well represented in SWOG clinical trials in comparison with US cancer population patients with the same cancers. The SWOG AYA population was more racially/ethnically diverse than older SWOG patients, although it was less diverse than the US AYA cancer population.Adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with cancer (aged 15-39 years) have not seen the same improvements in survival as younger (pediatric) patients and older patients (adults 40 years old or older). This may be related to their lower participation in clinical trials. This study evaluated the extent to which AYA patients were enrolled in a large, National Cancer Institute-sponsored network group over 25 years (1996-2020). Overall, 8.4% of the enrolled patients (7109 of 84,219) were AYAs; this was twice the corresponding rate of 3.8% in the US cancer population. AYA patients were also more racially/ethnically diverse than older trial patients, although they were less racially/ethnically diverse than the US AYA cancer population."

    "title": "Second Cancer Onset in Myeloproliferative Neoplasms: What, When, Why?",
    "content": "The risk of developing a solid cancer is a major issue arising in the disease course of a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). Although the connection between the two diseases has been widely described, the backstage of this complex scenario has still to be explored. Several cellular and molecular mechanisms have been suggested to link the two tumors. Sometimes the MPN is considered to trigger a second cancer but at other times both diseases seem to depend on the same source. Increasing knowledge in recent years has revealed emerging pathways, supporting older, more consolidated theories, but there are still many unresolved issues. Our work aims to present the biological face of the complex clinical scenario in MPN patients developing a second cancer, focusing on the main cellular and molecular pathways linking the two diseases."

    "content": "The comparative risks of a second cancer diagnosis are uncertain after primary cancer treatment with 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT), intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), or proton beam radiotherapy (PBRT).Pediatric and adult patients with a first cancer diagnosis between 2004 and 2015 who received 3DCRT, IMRT, or PBRT were identified in the National Cancer Database from 9 tumor types: head and neck, gastrointestinal, gynecologic, lymphoma, lung, prostate, breast, bone/soft tissue, and brain/central nervous system. The diagnosis of second cancer was modeled using multivariable logistic regression adjusting for age, follow-up duration, radiotherapy (RT) dose, chemotherapy, sociodemographic variables, and other factors. Propensity score matching also was used to balance baseline characteristics.In total, 450,373 patients were identified (33.5% received 3DCRT, 65.2% received IMRT, and 1.3% received PBRT) with median follow-up of 5.1\u00a0years after RT completion and a cumulative follow-up period of 2.54\u00a0million person-years. Overall, the incidence of second cancer diagnosis was 1.55 per 100 patient-years. In a comparison between IMRT versus 3DCRT, there was no overall difference in the risk of second cancer (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.00; 95% CI, 0.97-1.02; P\u00a0=\u00a0.75). By comparison, PBRT had an overall lower risk of second cancer versus IMRT (adjusted OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.26-0.36; P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). Results within each tumor type generally were consistent in the pooled analyses and also were maintained in propensity score-matched analyses.The risk of a second cancer diagnosis was similar after IMRT versus 3DCRT, whereas PBRT was associated with a lower risk of second cancer risk. Future work is warranted to determine the cost-effectiveness of PBRT and to identify the population best suited for this treatment."

    "title": "Prognostic communication about lung cancer in the precision oncology era: A multiple-perspective qualitative study.",
    "content": "Although most patients with cancer prefer to know their prognosis, prognostic communication between oncologists and patients is often insufficient. Targeted therapies for lung cancer improve survival yet are not curative and produce variable responses. This study sought to describe how oncologists communicate about prognosis with patients receiving targeted therapies for lung cancer.This qualitative study included 39 patients with advanced lung cancer with targetable mutations, 14 caregivers, and 10 oncologists. Semistructured interviews with patients and caregivers and focus groups or interviews with oncologists were conducted to explore their experiences with prognostic communication. One oncology follow-up visit was audio-recorded per patient. A framework approach was used to analyze interview transcripts, and a content analysis of patient-oncologist dialogue was conducted. Themes were identified within each source and then integrated across sources to create a multidimensional description of prognostic communication.Six themes in prognostic communication were identified: Patients with targetable mutations develop a distinct identity in the lung cancer community that affects their information-seeking and self-advocacy; oncologists set high expectations for targeted therapy; the uncertain availability of new therapies complicates prognostic discussions; patients and caregivers have variable information preferences; patients raise questions about progression by asking about physical symptoms or scan results; and patients' expectations of targeted therapy influence their medical decision-making.Optimistic patient-oncologist communication shapes the expectations of patients receiving targeted therapy for lung cancer and affects their decision-making. Further research and clinical guidance are needed to help oncologists to communicate uncertain outcomes effectively."

New cancer sites include the pancreas, kidney and renal pelvis, corpus and uterus, and childhood cancer sites for ages birth to 19 years inclusive.A new reporting delay model is presented for these estimates for more consistent results with the model used for the usual November SEER submissions, adjusting for the large case undercount in the February submission. Joinpoint regression methodology was used to assess trends. Delay-adjusted rates and trends were checked for validity between the February 2016 and November 2016 submissions.Validation revealed that the delay model provides similar estimates of eventual counts using either February or November submission data. Trends declined through 2014 for prostate and colon and rectum cancer for males and females, male and female lung cancer, and cervical cancer. Thyroid cancer and liver and intrahepatic bile duct cancer increased. Pancreas (male and female) and corpus and uterus cancer demonstrated a modest increase. Slight increases occurred for male kidney and renal pelvis, and for all childhood cancer sites for ages birth to 19 years.Evaluating early cancer data submissions, adjusted for reporting delay, produces timely and valid incidence rates and trends. The results of the current study support using delay-adjusted February submission data for valid incidence rate and trend estimates over several data cycles.

    "content": "Young adults and other working-age adults with cancer are at risk for cancer-related financial toxicity (FT), including material hardships, depletion of coping resources, and psychological burden. This study compares FT domains in young adults (18-39\u00a0years old) (YAs), other working-age adults (40-64\u00a0years old), and older adults (\u226565\u00a0years old) receiving cancer care.A total of 311 adults were surveyed using the multi-domain Economic Strain and Resilience in Cancer instrument measuring FT (0-10 score indicating least to greatest FT; score \u22655 severe FT). Participants were receiving ambulatory care from March-September 2019. Associations of age with overall FT and material hardship, coping resource depletion, and psychological burden FT domains were tested using Kruskal-Wallis and \u03c7<sup>2</sup> tests and multivariable generalized linear models with gamma distribution.YAs (median age, 31.5\u00a0years) comprised 9.6% of the sample; other working-age adults comprised 56.9%. Overall, material, coping, and psychological FT scores were worse in younger age adults versus older adults (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001 in all multivariable models). Compared with older adults, younger age adults demonstrated worse material hardship (median scores, 3.70 vs 4.80 vs 1.30 for YAs, other working-age, and older adults, respectively; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), coping resource depletion (4.50 vs 3.40 vs 0.80; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), and psychological burden (6.50 vs 7.00 vs 1.00; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Fifty percent of YAs had severe overall FT versus 40.7% of other working-age adults and 9.6% of older adults (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001).Younger age adults with cancer bore disproportionate FT. Interventions to address unmet needs are critical components for addressing FT in this population."

    "content": "During the past 4 decades, there has been a growing focus on preserving the fertility of patients with childhood cancer; however, no large studies have been conducted of live births across treatment decades during this period. Therefore, the authors estimated the potential birth deficit in female childhood cancer survivors and the probability of live births.In total, 8886 women were identified in the 5 Nordic cancer registries in whom a childhood cancer had been diagnosed during 1954 through 2006. A population comparison cohort of 62,903 women was randomly selected from the central population registries matched by age and country. All women were followed for live births recorded in medical birth registries. The cumulative probability and the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of a live birth were calculated by maternal age across treatment decades.The probability of a live birth increased with treatment decade, and, at age 30\u00a0years, the rate for survivors most recently diagnosed was close to the rate among the general population (1954-1969: RR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.54-0.78]; 1970s: RR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.60-0.74]; 1980s: RR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.64-0.74]; 1990s: RR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.87-0.95]; 2000s: RR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.91-0.97]).Female childhood cancer survivors had a lower probability of a live birth than women in the general population, although, in survivors diagnosed after 1989, the probability was close to that of the general population. Because the pattern of live births differs by cancer type, continuous efforts must be made to preserve fertility, counsel survivors, and refer them rapidly to fertility treatment if necessary.The purpose of this study was to compare the probability of giving birth to a liveborn child in female survivors of childhood cancer with that of women in the general population. Survivors of childhood cancer had a lower probability of live births than women in the general population, although survivors diagnosed after 1989 had a probability close to that of the general population. Continuing focus on how to preserve the potential for fertility among female patients with childhood cancer during treatment is important to increase their chances of having a child."

    "content": "High levels of sedentary behavior may negatively affect health outcomes in cancer survivors. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to clarify whether postdiagnosis sedentary behavior is related to survival, patient-reported outcomes, and anthropometric outcomes in cancer survivors.The Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL (The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and SPORTDiscus databases were searched from study inception to June 2019. Studies of adults who had been diagnosed with cancer that examined the association between sedentary behavior and mortality, patient-reported outcomes (eg, fatigue, depression), or anthropometric outcomes (eg, body mass index, waist circumference) were eligible for inclusion. Meta-analyses were performed to estimate hazard ratios for the highest compared with the lowest levels of sedentary behavior for all-cause and colorectal cancer-specific mortality outcomes. The ROBINS-E (Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies-of Exposures tool) and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) system were used to assess the risk of bias and the strength of evidence, respectively.Thirty-three eligible publications from a total of 3569 identified articles were included in the review. A higher level of postdiagnosis sedentary behavior was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.06-1.41; heterogeneity [I<sup>2</sup> statistic], 33.8%) as well as colorectal cancer-specific mortality (hazard ratio, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.14-2.06; I<sup>2</sup> , 0%). No clear or consistent associations between sedentary behavior and patient-reported or anthropometric outcomes were identified. The risk of bias in individual studies ranged from moderate to serious, and the strength of evidence ranged from very low to low.Although avoiding high levels of sedentary behavior after a cancer diagnosis may improve survival, further research is required to help clarify whether the association is causal."

    "content": "To the authors' knowledge, little is known regarding the impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) on people living with HIV and cancer (PLWHC), who have lower cancer treatment rates and worse cancer outcomes. To investigate this research gap, the authors examined the effects of the ACA on insurance coverage and receipt of cancer treatment among PLWHC in the United States.HIV-infected individuals aged 18 to 64\u00a0years old\u00a0with cancer diagnosed between 2011 and 2015 were identified in the National Cancer Data Base. Health insurance coverage and cancer treatment receipt were compared before and after implementation of the ACA in non-Medicaid expansion and Medicaid expansion states using difference-in-differences analysis.Of the 4794 PLWHC analyzed, approximately 49% resided in nonexpansion states and were\u00a0more often uninsured (16.7% vs 4.2%), nonwhite (65.2% vs 60.2%), and of low income (36.3% vs 26.9%) compared with those in Medicaid expansion states. After 2014, the percentage of uninsured individuals decreased in expansion states (from 4.9% to 3%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.01) and nonexpansion states (from 17.6% to 14.6%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.06), possibly due to increased Medicaid coverage in expansion states (from 36.9% to 39.2%) and increased private insurance coverage in nonexpansion states (from 29.5% to 34.7%). There was no significant difference in cancer treatment receipt noted between Medicaid expansion and nonexpansion states. However, the percentage of PLWHC treated at academic facilities increased significantly only in expansion states (from 40.2% to 46.7% [P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001]; difference-in-differences analysis: 7.2 percentage points [P\u00a0=\u00a0.02]).The implementation of the ACA was associated with improved insurance coverage among PLWHC. Lack of insurance still is common in non-Medicaid expansion states. Patients with minority or low socioeconomic status more often resided in nonexpansion states, thereby highlighting the need for further insurance expansion."

    "content": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted health care delivery worldwide. Cancer is a leading cause of death, and the impact of the pandemic on cancer diagnoses is an important public health concern.This cross-sectional study retrospectively analyzed the electronic medical records of 80,138 cancer patients diagnosed between January 1, 2019, and May 31, 2021. Outcome measures included weekly number of new cancer cases and trends in weekly cancer cases, before and after the pandemic; patient demographics; and positive COVID-19 test rates.Beginning March 4, 2020, defined as the onset of the pandemic, weekly cancer cases declined precipitously (-110.0 cases per week [95% confidence interval, -190.2 to -29.8]) for 4 weeks, followed by a moderate recovery (+23.7 cases per week [9.1 to 38.4]) of 10 weeks duration. Thereafter, weekly cancer cases trended slowly back toward pre-COVID-19 baseline levels. Following the pandemic onset, there was a cumulative year-over-year decline in cancer cases overall of 7.3%, including a 20.2%, 14.3%, and 12.8% decline in nonmelanoma skin cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer, respectively. Changes in case volumes were accompanied by variations in patient characteristics, including region, age, gender, race, insurance coverage, and COVID-19 positive test rates (P < .01 for all). Among patients tested for COVID-19, 5.3% had a positive result.The data in this study demonstrate a substantial reduction in cancer diagnoses following the onset of COVID-19, which appear to reach expected pre-COVID norms 12 months later. The largest reduction was noted among cancers that are typically screen-detected or identified as part of a routine wellness examination."

    "content": "Although increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been observed after chemotherapy and radiotherapy, less is known about radiotherapy-related risks of specific AML subtypes and other specific myeloid neoplasms. We used the US population-based cancer registry data to evaluate risk of myeloid neoplasms among three cohorts of cancer survivors initially treated with radiotherapy only. We included 1-year survivors of first primary thyroid (radioiodine only, stages I-IV; N\u2009=\u200949\u2009879), prostate (excluding stage IV; N\u2009=\u2009237\u2009439), or uterine corpus cancers (stage I-II; N\u2009=\u200916\u2009208) diagnosed during 2000-2013. We calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and excess absolute risks (EARs). Thyroid cancer survivors had significantly elevated risks of total AML (SIR\u2009=\u20092.77, 95% CI: 1.99-3.76), AML with cytogenetic abnormalities (SIR\u2009=\u20093.90, 95% CI: 1.57-8.04), AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (SIR\u2009=\u20092.87, 95% CI: 1.05-6.25), and BCR-ABL1-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) (SIR\u2009=\u20095.38, 95% CI: 2.58-9.89). Irradiated prostate and uterine corpus cancer survivors were at elevated risk for total AML (SIR\u2009=\u20091.14, 95% CI: 1.03-1.27 and SIR\u2009=\u20091.77, 95% CI: 1.01-2.87, respectively), AML with cytogenetic abnormalities (SIR\u2009=\u20092.52, 95% CI: 1.84-3.37 and SIR\u2009=\u20097.21, 95% CI: 2.34-16.83, respectively), and acute promyelocytic leukemia (SIR\u2009=\u20093.20, 95% CI: 2.20-4.49 and SIR\u2009=\u20098.88, 95% CI: 2.42-22.73, respectively). In addition, prostate cancer survivors were at increased risk of BCR-ABL1-positive CML (SIR\u2009=\u20092.11, 95% CI: 1.52-2.85). Our findings support the importance of diagnostic precision in myeloid neoplasm classification since susceptibility following radiotherapy may vary by myeloid neoplasm subtype, thereby informing risk/benefit discussions in first primary cancer treatment."

Siblings, offspring, parents, nephews, and nieces of probands were identified from the Population Registry. Childhood and young adult (ChYA) cancer diagnoses (age 0-39\u00a0years) in relatives were identified by linking to the Finnish Cancer Registry. The relative risk of ChYA cancer in family members of probands was estimated using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs).Among 58,010 family members of the 9078 probands, 363 ChYA cancers were diagnosed, 324 of which were expected (SIR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.01-1.24). The risk of ChYA cancer was elevated both in offspring (SIR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.51-3.24) and in siblings (SIR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.01-1.36). Offspring of probands with retinoblastoma were at highest risk (SIR, 75.85; 95% CI, 32.75-149.45); risks were also elevated for siblings of probands with lymphoma (SIR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.14-2.25). Known cancer predisposition syndromes were observed in 29 (66%) of 44 sibling pairs with cancers diagnosed at <21\u00a0years of age and in 20% of the 135 families with a childhood cancer proband whose sibling was diagnosed with a young adult malignancy.Linked population-based registry data indicate a modestly increased risk of ChYA in relatives of children with cancer. Some of the observed cancer clusters in the cohort suggest novel patterns and familial cancer syndromes."

While this might lead to underestimation, the trend shows that there has been a decrease in total cancer-related deaths in Turkey. Pancreatic cancer, on the other hand, gains a higher proportion in cancer-related deaths in Turkey as in the world. Increasing deaths from lung and breast cancer in women remind of the importance of tobacco control interventions and cancer screening programs."

    "content": "Although adherence to the American Cancer Society (ACS) Guidelines on Nutrition and Physical Activity for Cancer Prevention associates with lower risk of obesity-related cancer (ORC) incidence and mortality, evidence in Black and Latina women is limited. This association was examined in Black and Latina participants in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI).Semi-Markov multistate model examined the association between ACS guideline adherence and ORC incidence and mortality in the presence of competing events, combined and separately, for 9301 Black and 4221 Latina postmenopausal women. Additionally, ACS guideline adherence was examined in a subset of less common ORCs and potential effect modification by neighborhood socioeconomic status and smoking.Over a median of 11.1, 12.5, and 3.7\u2009years of follow-up for incidence, nonconditional mortality, and conditional mortality, respectively, 1191 ORCs (Black/Latina women: 841/269), 1970 all-cause deaths (Black/Latina women: 1576/394), and 341 ORC-related deaths (Black/Latina women: 259/82) were observed. Higher ACS guideline adherence was associated with lower ORC incidence for both Black (cause-specific hazard ratio [CSHR]<sub>highvs.low</sub> : 0.72; 95% CI, 0.55-0.94) and Latina (CSHR<sub>highvs.low</sub> : 0.58, 95% CI, 0.36-0.93) women; but not conditional all-cause mortality (Black hazard ratio [HR]<sub>highvs.low</sub> : 0.86; 95% CI, 0.53-1.39; Latina HR<sub>highvs.low</sub> : 0.81; 95% CI, 0.32-2.06). Higher adherence was associated with lower incidence of less common ORC (P<sub>trend</sub> \u00a0=\u00a0.025), but conditional mortality events were limited. Adherence and ORC-specific deaths were not associated and there was no evidence of effect modification.Adherence to the ACS guidelines was associated with lower risk of ORCs and less common ORCs but was not for conditional ORC-related mortality.Evidence on the association between the American Cancer Society Guidelines on Nutrition and Physical Activity for Cancer Prevention and cancer remains scarce for women of color. Adherence to the guidelines and risk of developing one of 13 obesity-related cancers among Black and Latina women in the Women's Health Initiative was examined. Women who followed the lifestyle guidelines had 28% to 42% lower risk of obesity-related cancer. These findings support public health interventions to reduce growing racial/ethnic disparities in obesity-related cancers."

    "content": "The objective of this study was to compare the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of Dutch adult male and female childhood cancer survivors (CCSs) to general population references and to study medical determinants.CCSs from the Dutch Childhood Cancer Survivor Study LATER cohort (1963-2001) part 2, who were 18 years old or older (time since diagnosis \u2265 5 years), were invited to complete the TNO-AZL Questionnaire for Adult Health-Related Quality of Life. Domain scores and proportions of CCSs with impaired HRQOL (score < 25th percentile of the reference scores) were compared with references via Mann-Whitney U tests and logistic regression analyses corrected for age and sex (P < .004). Interactions of group with sex were included if they were significant (P < .05). Moreover, medical determinants were analyzed with multivariable logistic regression analyses.HRQOL scores for 1766 CCSs (mean age, 35.9 years [standard deviation, 9.4 years]; male, 51%; response rate, 71%) differed from references on most domains with small effect sizes. Both male and female CCSs were more often impaired in gross and fine motor functioning, cognitive functioning, sleep, and vitality with odds ratios (ORs) > 1.4. In addition, female CCSs were more often impaired in daily activities, pain, and sexuality (ORs, 1.4-1.9) and were less often aggressive (OR, 0.6). CCCs of central nervous system (CNS) tumors, bone tumors, and retinoblastoma and those with cranial, abdominopelvic, or lower extremity radiotherapy were at increased risk of impairment in 1 or more domains.Dutch adult CCSs, especially females, have impaired HRQOL in several domains; this is most pronounced in cognitive functioning. The vulnerabilities of subgroups at risk, such as CCSs of CNS tumors, were confirmed. Surveillance of HRQOL and multidisciplinary survivor care are recommended.The health-related quality of life in a Dutch nationwide cohort of 1766 survivors of childhood cancer was studied. Survivors of childhood cancer were found to have lower health-related quality of life in several domains (eg, motor functioning and vitality) in comparison with the general population. They most often reported low cognitive functioning (eg, memory and attention). Females had low health-related quality of life in more domains than males. Survivors of brain tumors had low health-related quality of life in most domains. Monitoring health-related quality of life regularly and collaborating between disciplines in survivor care is recommended."

    "title": "Cancer-related mortality among people with intellectual disabilities: A nationwide population-based cohort study.",
    "content": "Concerns have been raised about access to cancer screening and the timely receipt of cancer care for people with an intellectual disability (ID). However, knowledge about cancer mortality as a potential consequence of these disparities is still limited. This study, therefore, compared cancer-related mortality patterns between people with and without ID.A historical cohort study (2015-2019) linked the Dutch adult population (approximately 12 million people with an ID prevalence of 1.45%) and mortality registries. Cancer-related mortality was identified by the underlying cause of death (according to the chapter on neoplasms in the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision). Observed mortality and calculated age- and sex-standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported.There were 11,102 deaths in the ID population (21.7% cancer-related; n = 2408) and 730,405 deaths in the general population (31.2%; n = 228,120) available for analysis. Cancer was noted as the cause of death more often among people with ID in comparison with the general population (SMR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.42-1.54), particularly in the young age groups. High-mortality cancers included cancers within the national screening program (SMRs, 1.43-1.94), digestive cancers (SMRs, 1.24-2.56), bladder cancer (SMR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.61-2.54), and cancers of unknown primary (SMR, 2.48; 95% CI, 2.06-2.89).Cancer was reported as the cause of death approximately 1.5 times more often in people with ID compared with the general population. This mortality disparity may indicate adverse effects from inequalities in screening and cancer care experienced by people with ID.People with an intellectual disability (ID) may find it challenging to participate in cancer screening or to receive timely cancer care. To understand potential consequences in terms of mortality, this study compared cancer-related mortality between people with and without ID in the Netherlands. Cancer was reported as the cause of death approximately 1.5 times more often among people with ID than others. Because large differences were found that were related to screening cancers and cancers for which the primary tumor was unknown, this study's results raise concerns about equality in screening practices and cancer care for people with ID."

    "title": "Recommendations for the surveillance of education and employment outcomes in survivors of childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancer: A report from the International Late Effects of Childhood Cancer Guideline Harmonization Group.",
    "content": "Educational achievement and employment outcomes are critical indicators of quality of life in survivors of childhood, adolescent, and young adult (CAYA) cancer. This review is aimed at providing an evidence-based clinical practice guideline (CPG) with internationally harmonized recommendations for the surveillance of education and employment outcomes in survivors of CAYA cancer diagnosed before the age of 30\u00a0years. The CPG was developed by a multidisciplinary panel under the umbrella of the International Late Effects of Childhood Cancer Guideline Harmonization Group. After evaluating concordances and discordances of 4 existing CPGs, the authors performed a systematic literature search through February 2021. They screened articles for eligibility, assessed quality, and extracted and summarized the data from included articles. The authors formulated recommendations based on the evidence and clinical judgment. There were 3930 articles identified, and 83 of them, originating from 17 countries, were included. On a group level, survivors were more likely to have lower educational achievement and more likely to be unemployed than comparisons. Key risk factors for poor outcomes included receiving a primary diagnosis of a central nervous system tumor and experiencing late effects. The authors recommend that health care providers be aware of the risk of educational and employment problems, implement regular surveillance, and refer survivors to specialists if problems are identified. In conclusion, this review presents a harmonized CPG that aims to facilitate evidence-based care, positively influence education and employment outcomes, and ultimately minimize the burden of disease and treatment-related late adverse effects for survivors of CAYA cancers. LAY SUMMARY: A multidisciplinary panel has developed guidelines for the surveillance of education and employment outcomes among survivors of childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancer. On the basis of evidence showing that survivors are at risk for lower educational achievement and unemployment, it is recommended that all survivors receive regular screening for educational and employment outcomes."

    "title": "Cisplatin Reduces the Frequencies of Radiotherapy-Induced Micronuclei in Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes of Patients with Gynaecological Cancer: Possible Implications for the Risk of Second Malignant Neoplasms.",
    "content": "Gynaecologic cancers are common among women and treatment includes surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy, where the last two methods induce DNA damage in non-targeted cells like peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). Damaged normal cells can transform leading to second malignant neoplasms (SMN) but the level of risk and impact of risk modifiers is not well defined. We investigated how radiotherapy alone or in combination with chemotherapy induce DNA damage in PBL of cervix and endometrial cancer patients during therapy. Blood samples were collected from nine endometrial cancer patients (treatment with radiotherapy + chemotherapy-RC) and nine cervical cancer patients (treatment with radiotherapy alone-R) before radiotherapy, 3 weeks after onset of radiotherapy and at the end of radiotherapy. Half of each blood sample was irradiated ex vivo with 2 Gy of gamma radiation in order to check how therapy influenced the sensitivity of PBL to radiation. Analysed endpoints were micronucleus (MN) frequencies, apoptosis frequencies and cell proliferation index. The results were characterised by strong individual variation, especially the MN frequencies and proliferation index. On average, despite higher total dose and larger fields, therapy alone induced the same level of MN in PBL of RC patients as compared to R. This result was accompanied by a higher level of apoptosis and stronger inhibition of cell proliferation in RC patients. The ex vivo dose induced fewer MN, more apoptosis and more strongly inhibited proliferation of PBL of RC as compared to R patients. These results are interpreted as evidence for a sensitizing effect of chemotherapy on radiation cytotoxicity. The possible implications for the risk of second malignant neoplasms are discussed."

    "content": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between self-identified race and overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and response to therapy among patients enrolled in the randomized Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB)/SWOG 80405 trial.Patients with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer who were enrolled in the CALGB/SWOG 80405 trial were identified by race. On the basis of covariates (treatment arm, KRAS status, sex, age, and body mass index), each Black patient was exact matched with a White patient. The association between race and OS and PFS was examined using a marginal Cox proportional hazard model for matched pairs. The interaction between KRAS status and race was tested in the model. The association between race and response to therapy and adverse events were examined using a marginal logistic regression model.In total, 392 patients were matched and included in the final data set. No difference in OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-1.16), PFS (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.78-1.20), or response to therapy (odds ratio [OR], 1.00; 95% CI, 0.65-1.52) was observed between Black and White patients. Patients with KRAS mutant status (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.02-1.67), a performance statusscore of 1 (reference, a performance status of 0; HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.18-1.88), or \u22653 metastatic sites (reference, 1 metastatic site; HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.22-2.28) experienced worse OS. Black patients experienced lower rates and risk of grade \u22653 fatigue (6.6% vs 13.3%; OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.24-0.91) but were equally likely to be treated with a dose reduction (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.72-1.65).No difference in OS, PFS, or response to therapy was observed between Black patients and White patients in an equal treatment setting of the CALGB/SWOG 80405 randomized controlled trial.Despite improvements in screening and treatment, studies have demonstrated worse outcomes in Black patients with colorectal cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there was a difference in cancer-specific outcomes among Black and White patients receiving equivalent treatment on the CALGB/SWOG 80405 randomized clinical trial. In this study, there was no difference in overall survival, progression-free survival, or response to therapy between Black and White patients treated on a clinical trial. These findings suggest that access to care and differences in treatment may be responsible for racial disparities in colorectal cancer."

All phase 2, 2/3, and 3 trials activated during the period between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2019, were identified (n\u00a0=\u00a01568) and reduced to a set of 304 that met predetermined criteria to focus on cooperative group-led trials that involved therapy for newly diagnosed cancer and had age eligibility overlapping the AYA range. The proportion of AYA patients relative to total accrual, along with 95% bootstrapped CI was calculated for patients enrolled pre-NCTN and post-NCTN.AYA accrual comprised 9.5% (95% CI, 7.6-11.8) pre-NCTN compared with 14.0% (95% CI, 9.9-18.3) post-NCTN. The mean difference in proportions post-NCTN compared with pre-NCTN was 4.4% (0.7%-8.3%).These results indicate an increase in AYA participation in trials conducted within the NCTN relative to the pre-NCTN period. This suggests an awareness and utilization of NCTN trials for AYAs with cancer."

Rates of pathogenic/likely pathogenic germline variants (PVs) and downstream counseling were compared across ancestry groups (mutually exclusive groups based on self-reported race/ethnicity and Ashkenazi Jewish [AJ] heritage) using nonparametric tests and multivariable logistic regression models.Among 15,775 patients (59.6%, non-Hispanic [NH]-White; 15.7%, AJ; 20.5%, non-White [6.9%, Asian; 6.8%, Black/African American (AA); 6.7%, Hispanic; 0.1%, Other], and 4.2%, unknown), 2663 (17%) had a PV. Non-White patients had a lower PV rate (n\u00a0=\u00a0433, 13.4%) compared to NH-Whites (n\u00a0=\u00a01451, 15.4%) and AJ patients (n\u00a0=\u00a0683, 27.6%), p\u2009<\u2009.01, with differences in mostly moderate and low/recessive/uncertain penetrance variants. Among 2239 patients with new PV, 1652 (73.8%) completed recommended genetic counseling. Non-White patients had lower rates of genetic counseling (67.7%) than NH-White (73.7%) and AJ patients (78.8%), p\u2009<\u2009.01, with lower rates occurring in Black/AA (63%) compared to NH-White patients, even after adjustment for confounders (odds ratio, 0.60; 95% confidence interval, 0.37-0.97; p\u00a0=\u00a0.036). Non-White, particularly Black/AA and Asian, probands had a trend toward lower rates and numbers of at-risk family members being seen for counseling/genetic testing.Despite minimizing barriers to genetic testing, non-White patients were less likely to receive recommended cancer genetics follow-up, with potential implications for oncologic care, cancer risk reduction, and at-risk family members.Genetic testing is becoming an important part of cancer care, and we wanted to see if genetics care was different between individuals of different backgrounds. We studied 15,775 diverse patients with cancer who had genetic testing using a test called MSK-IMPACT that was covered by research funding. Clinically important genetic findings were high in all groups. However, Black patients were less likely to get recommended counseling compared to White patients. Even after removing many roadblocks, non-White and especially Black patients were less likely to get recommended genetics care, which may affect their cancer treatments and families."

    "content": "Gathering information directly from cancer survivors has advanced our understanding of the cancer survivorship experience. However, it is unknown whether surveys can distinguish important subgroups of cancer survivors. This study aimed to describe the current landscape of survey questions used to identify and describe cancer survivors in national cross-sectional studies.Using publicly available databases, the authors identified national cross-sectional surveys used in the United States within the past 15 years that included a question on self-reported history of cancer. After abstracting questions and response items used to identify cancer survivors, they conducted a descriptive analysis.The authors identified 14 national cross-sectional surveys, with half administered to the general population and the other half administered to cancer survivors. The most common question used to identify cancer survivors was \"Have you ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that you had cancer?\" Most surveys had questions asking participants to identify a single cancer type (n = 11), multiple prior cancer diagnoses or types (n = 11), and the time from diagnosis (n = 12). Treatment questions varied from active treatment status to specific treatments received. Questions addressing cancer stage (n = 2), subtypes (n = 1), metastatic status (n = 3), and recurrence (n = 4) were less frequently included.There is no standard method for assessing self-reported cancer history, and this limits the ability to distinguish among potentially important subgroups of survivors. Future cross-sectional surveys that capture nuanced data elements, such as cancer types, stages/subtypes, metastatic/recurrent status, and treatments received, can help to fill important gaps in cancer survivorship research and clinical care."

If and how cancer survivors were affected by the first year of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are largely unknown.Using data from the nationwide, population-based Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (2017-2020), the authors investigated changes in health-related measures during the COVID-19 pandemic among cancer survivors and compared them with changes among adults without a cancer history in the United States. Sociodemographic and health-related measures such as insurance coverage, employment status, health behaviors, and health status were self-reported. Adjusted prevalence ratios of health-related measures in 2020 versus 2017-2019 were calculated with multivariable logistic regressions and stratified by age group (18-64 vs. \u226565\u2009years).Among adults aged 18-64\u2009years, the uninsured rate did not change significantly in 2020 despite increases in unemployment. The prevalence of unhealthy behaviors, such as insufficient sleep and smoking, decreased in 2020, and self-rated health improved, regardless of cancer history. Notably, declines in smoking were larger among cancer survivors than nonelderly adults without a cancer history. Few changes were observed for adults aged \u226565\u2009years.Further research is needed to confirm the observed positive health behavior and health changes and to investigate the role of potential mechanisms, such as the national and regional policy responses to the pandemic regarding insurance coverage, unemployment benefits, and financial assistance. As polices related to the public health emergency expire, ongoing monitoring of longer term effects of the pandemic on cancer survivorship is warranted."

    "content": "Measuring function with valid and responsive tools in patients with cancer is essential for driving clinical decision-making and for the end points of clinical trials. Current patient-reported outcome measurements of function fall short for many reasons. This study evaluates the responsiveness of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Cancer Function Brief 3D Profile, a novel measure of function across multiple domains.Two hundred nine participants across five geographically distinct tertiary care centers completed the assessment and pain rating at two outpatient cancer rehabilitation clinic visits. Patients and providers completed a global rating of change measure at the second visit to indicate whether the patient was improving or worsening in function. Multiple response indices and linear models measured whether the measure was responsive to self-reported and clinician-rated changes over time. Correlations between changes in function and changes in anchors (pain rating and performance status) were also calculated.Function as measured by the PROMIS Cancer Function Brief 3D Profile changed appropriately as both patients and clinicians rated change. Small to moderate effect sizes supported the tool's responsiveness. Function was moderately correlated with pain and more strongly correlated with performance status, and changes in function corresponded with changes in anchor variables. No floor/ceiling effect was found.The PROMIS Cancer Function Brief 3D Profile is sensitive to changes over time in patients with cancer. The measure may be useful in clinical practice and as an end point in clinical trials.We gave patients a questionnaire by which they told their physicians how well they were functioning, including how fatigued they were. This study tested that questionnaire to see whether the scores would change if patients got better or worse."

However, to the authors' knowledge, little is known regarding the prevalence and health care needs of this growing population, particularly in safety net settings.The authors identified adults with a history of cancer documented in primary care electronic health records within a network of community health centers (CHCs) in 19 states. The authors estimated cancer history prevalence among >1.2\u00a0million patients and compared sex-specific site distributions with national estimates. Each survivor was matched to 3 patients without cancer from the same set of clinics. The demographic characteristics, primary care use, and comorbidity burden then were compared between the 2 groups, assessing differences with absolute standardized mean differences (ASMDs). ASMD values >0.1 denote meaningful differences between groups. Generalized estimating equations yielded adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for select indicators.A total of 40,266 cancer survivors were identified (prevalence of 3.0% of adult CHC patients). Compared with matched cancer-free patients, a higher percentage of survivors had \u22656 primary care visits across 3\u00a0years (62% vs 48%) and were insured (83% vs 74%) (ASMD, >0.1 for both). Cancer survivors had excess medical complexity, including a higher prevalence of depression, asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and liver disease (ASMD, >0.1 for all). Survivors had higher odds of any opioid prescription (aOR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.19-1.27) and chronic opioid therapy (aOR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.23-1.32) compared with matched controls (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001 for all).Identifying cancer survivors and understanding their patterns of utilization and physical and mental comorbidities present an opportunity to tailor primary health care services to this population."

The primary study outcome was mortality, defined as all-cause mortality or in-hospital mortality within 30 days of initial COVID-19 diagnosis. The pooled proportion of mortality was estimated using a random-effects model, and study-level moderators of heterogeneity were assessed through subgroup analysis and metaregression.Among 2922 patients from 13 primarily inpatient studies of individuals with COVID-19 and cancer, the pooled 30-day mortality rate was 30% (95% CI, 25%-35%). The overall pooled 30-day mortality rate among 624 patients from 5 studies that included a mixture of inpatient and outpatient populations was 15% (95% CI, 9%-22%). Among the hospitalized studies, the heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> statistic) of the meta-analysis remained high (I<sup>2</sup> , 82%). Cancer subtype (hematologic vs solid), older age, male sex, and recent active cancer therapy each partially explained the heterogeneity of mortality reporting. In multivariable metaregression, male sex, along with an interaction between the median patient age and recent active cancer therapy, explained most of the between-study heterogeneity (R<sup>2</sup> , 96%).Pooled mortality estimates for hospitalized patients with cancer and COVID-19 remain high at 30%, with significant heterogeneity across studies. Dedicated community-based studies are needed in the future to help assess overall COVID-19 mortality among the broader population of patients with cancer."

The syndrome is associated with cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas, and some patients develop a lethal form of kidney cancer. This study provides estimates for the FH carrier frequency and kidney cancer penetrance.Data sets containing sequencing data for the FH gene were used: the 1000 Genomes Project (1000GP) and the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC). Alterations in the FH gene were characterized on the basis of different variant risk tiers: 1) ClinVar annotated variants, 2) loss-of-function alterations, and 3) highly impactful missense alterations. The cumulative incidence of FH alterations overall and by different world populations was evaluated in 1000GP and ExAC. A lifetime penetrance of HLRCC kidney cancer risk was generated with 3 estimates of the annual incidence.The overall allele frequencies of tier 1 to 3 FH alterations in the ExAC and 1000GP data sets were 2.54 \u00d7 10<sup>-3</sup> (1 in 393) and 1.20 \u00d7 10<sup>-3</sup> (1 in 835), respectively. There were differences in the allele frequencies of FH alterations between world populations. Based on various estimates of the percentage of kidney cancers with FH alterations, the lifetime kidney cancer penetrance for carrier estimate 3 in ExAC was 1.7% to 5.8%.FH alterations are common and are carried by approximately 1 in 1000 individuals according to the more conservative estimates. The lifetime kidney cancer penetrance appears lower than previously estimated. Although databases are not population cohorts, they provide a useful quantitative estimate of rare variants with low penetrance."

    "content": "eHealth interventions can help cancer survivors self-manage their health outside the clinic. Little is known about how best to engage and assist survivors across the age and cancer treatment spectra.The American Cancer Society conducted a randomized controlled trial that assessed efficacy of, and engagement with, Springboard Beyond Cancer, an eHealth self-management program for cancer survivors. Intent-to treat analyses assessed effects of intervention engagement for treatment (on-treatment vs completed) overall (n = 176; 88 control, 88 intervention arm) and separately by age (<60 years vs older). Multiple imputation was used to account for participants who were lost to follow-up (n = 41) or missing self-efficacy data (n = 1) at 3 months follow-up.Self-efficacy for managing cancer, the primary outcome of this trial, increased significantly within the intervention arm and for those who had completed treatment (Cohen's d = 0.26, 0.31, respectively). Additionally, participants with moderate-to-high engagement in the text and/or web intervention (n = 30) had a significantly greater self-efficacy for managing cancer-related issues compared to the control group (n = 68), with a medium effect size (Cohen's d = 0.44). Self-efficacy did not differ between the intervention and control arm at 3 months post-baseline.Study results suggest that cancer survivors benefit variably from eHealth tools. To maximize effects of such tools, it is imperative to tailor information to a priori identified survivor subgroups and increase engagement efforts."

    "content": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a high-risk cancer predisposition syndrome caused by pathogenic germline variants of TP53. Cancer surveillance has noted a significant survival advantage in individuals with LFS; however, little is known about the feasibility, acceptance, and psychosocial effects of such a program.Pathogenic TP53 germline variant carriers completed a 7-part questionnaire evaluating sociodemographics, cancer history, surveillance participation, reasons for nonadherence, worries, and distress adapted from the Cancer Worry Scale. Counselees' common concerns and suggestions were assessed in MAXQDA Analytics Pro 12.Forty-nine participants (46 females and 3 males), aged 40.0 \u00b1 12.6\u00a0years, formed the study population; 43 (88%) had a personal cancer history (including multiple cancers in 10 [20%]). Forty-three individuals participated (88%) in surveillance during the study or formerly. Willingness to undergo surveillance was influenced by satisfaction with genetic testing and counseling (P\u00a0=\u00a0.019 [Fisher-Yates test]) but not by sociodemographics, cancer history, or distress level. Almost one-third of the participants reported logistical difficulties in implementing surveillance because of the high frequency of medical visits, scheduling difficulties, and the travel distance to their surveillance providers. Self-reported distress and perceived emotional burden for family members and partners were moderate (median for self-reported distress, 3.3; median for perceived emotional burden, 3.0). For both, the interquartile range was moderate to very high (2.7-3.7 and 3.0-3.7, respectively).Individuals with LFS require efficient counseling as well as an accessible, well-organized, interdisciplinary, standardized surveillance program to increase adherence and psychological coping."

    "content": "Anthracycline-related cardiomyopathy is a leading cause of late morbidity in childhood cancer survivors. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a class of phase II detoxification enzymes that facilitate the elimination of anthracyclines. As free-radical scavengers, GSTs could play a role in oxidative damage-induced cardiomyopathy. Associations between the GST\u03bc1 (GSTM1) null genotype and iron-overload-related cardiomyopathy have been reported in patients with thalassemia.The authors sought to identify an association between the GSTM1 null genotype and anthracycline-related cardiomyopathy in childhood cancer survivors and to corroborate the association by examining GSTM1 gene expression in peripheral blood and human-induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) from survivors with and without cardiomyopathy. GSTM1 gene deletion was examined by polymerase chain reaction in 75 survivors who had clinically validated cardiomyopathy (cases) and in 92 matched survivors without cardiomyopathy (controls). Conditional logistic regression analysis adjusting for sex, age at cancer diagnosis, chest radiation, and anthracycline dose was used to assess the association between genotype and cardiomyopathy. Proprietary bead array technology and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to measure GSTM1 expression levels in samples from 20 cases and 20 matched controls. hiPSC-CMs from childhood cancer survivors (3 with cardiomyopathy, 3 without cardiomyopathy) also were examined for GSTM1 gene expression levels.A significant association was observed between the risk of cardiomyopathy and the GSTM1 null genotype (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.3-5.9; P\u00a0=\u00a0.007). There was significant downregulation of GSTM1 expression in cases compared with controls (average relative expression, 0.67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.57 vs 1.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.33, respectively; P\u00a0=\u00a0.049). hiPSC-CMs from patients who had cardiomyopathy revealed reduced GSTM1 expression (P\u00a0=\u00a0.007).The current findings could facilitate the identification of childhood cancer survivors who are at risk for anthracycline-related cardiomyopathy."

    "content": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and cancer are serious public health problems worldwide. However, little is known about the risk factors of in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients with and without cancer in Brazil. The objective of this study was to evaluate the risk factors of in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients with and without cancer and to compare mortality according to gender and topography during the year 2020 in Brazil.This was a secondary data study of hospitalized adult patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 by real-time polymerase chain reaction testing in Brazil. The data were collected from the Influenza Epidemiological Surveillance Information System.This study analyzed data from 322,817 patients. The prevalence of cancer in patients with COVID-19 was 2.3%. COVID-19 patients with neurological diseases and cancer had the most lethal comorbidities in both sexes. COVID-19 patients with cancer were more likely to be older (median age, 67 vs 62 years; P < .001), to have a longer hospital stay (13.1 vs 11.5 days; P < .001), to be admitted to the intensive care unit (45.3% vs 39.6%; P < .001), to receive more invasive mechanical ventilation (27.1% vs 21.9%), and to have a higher risk of death (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.83-2.06; P < .001) than those without cancer. Patients with hematological neoplasia (aOR, 2.85; 95% CI, 2.41-3.38; P < .001) had a higher risk of mortality than those with solid tumors (aOR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.72-1.95; P < .001) in both sexes.Brazilian COVID-19 patients with cancer have higher disease severity and a higher risk of mortality than those without cancer."

    "content": "Epidemiologic evidence reporting the role of frailty in survival among older adults with a prior cancer diagnosis is limited.A total of 2050 older adults (\u226560 years old) surviving for at least 1 year after a cancer diagnosis and 9474 older adults without a cancer history from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2014) were included for analysis. The exposure variable, a 45-item frailty index (FI), was categorized on the basis of validated cutoffs (FI \u2264 0.10 [fit], 0.10 < FI \u2264 0.21 [prefrail], and FI > 0.21 [frail]). All-cause mortality was ascertained via the National Death Index. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence interval (CIs) for the FI, and this was followed by restricted cubic splines depicting dose-response curves.For older cancer survivors, the mean age at the baseline was 72.6 years (SD, 7.1 years); 5.9% were fit, 38.2% were prefrail, and 55.9% were frail. Older adults without a cancer history were slightly younger (mean age, 70.0 years) and less frail (47.9% were frail). At each level of the FI, cancer survivors (1.9 per 100 person-years for FI \u2264 0.10, 3.4 per 100 person-years for 0.10 < FI \u2264 0.21, and 7.5 per 100 person-years for FI > 0.21) had higher mortality than their cancer-free counterparts (1.4 per 100 person-years for FI \u2264 0.10, 2.4 per 100 person-years for 0.10 < FI \u2264 0.21, and 5.4 per 100 person-years for FI > 0.21). The multivariable model suggested a positive association between the FI and all-cause mortality for survivors (aHR for FI > 0.21 vs FI \u2264 0.10, 2.80; 95% CI, 1.73-4.53) and participants without a cancer history (aHR for FI > 0.21 vs FI \u2264 0.10, 2.75; 95% CI, 2.29-3.32). Restricted cubic splines indicated that all-cause mortality risk increased with the FI in a monotonic pattern.Frailty is associated with a higher risk of death in older cancer survivors and the elderly without a cancer history."

We aim to provide recommendations for opportunistic screening for individuals whose sibling had been diagnosed with cancer.During the physical examination in Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, 43,300 people were asked if they have at least two siblings who developed cancer.A total of 1270 sibling-pairs from 766 families developed cancer, including 367 pairs of brothers (Bro-pairs), 368 pairs of sisters (Sis-pairs), and 535 pairs of brother-and-sister (BroSis-pairs). The mean ages at diagnosis of cancer for the three groups were from 58 to 62\u2009years. More than half of Bro-pairs (55.3%) or Sis-pairs (51.1%) had cancer from the same systemic origin, and more than a quarter of Bro-pairs (28.1%) and Sis-pairs (37.2%) developed the same type of cancer. However, only 36.0% of BroSis-pairs developed cancers from the same systemic origin, and 18.9% developed the same type of cancer. In Bro-pairs and BroSis-pairs, lung cancer and digestive system cancer were the most common cancers, while in Sis-pairs, breast cancer, lung cancer, cervical cancer, liver cancer and thyroid cancer were the most common ones.If an individual's sibling is diagnosed with cancer, the individual should consider participating in opportunistic screening annually, especially for lung cancer and digestive system cancers for both sexes. For sisters, breast cancer, cervical cancer and thyroid cancer should be screened early. Additionally, genetic services are essential for individuals who have siblings with cancer."

    "content": "Patients with prior colon cancer have increased risk of metachronous colorectal neoplasms; therefore, endoscopic surveillance is indicated. Current recommendations are not risk-stratified. We investigated predictive factors for colorectal neoplasms to build a model to spare colonoscopies for low-risk patients.This was a multicenter, retrospective study including patients who underwent surgery for colon cancer in 2001\u200a-\u200a2008 (derivation cohort) and 2009\u200a-\u200a2013 (validation cohort). A predictive model for neoplasm occurrence at second surveillance colonoscopy was developed and validated.421 and 203 patients were included in derivation and validation cohort, respectively. At second surveillance colonoscopy, 112 (26.6\u200a%) and 55 (27.1\u200a%) patients had metachronous neoplasms in derivation and validation groups; three cancers were detected in the latter. History of left-sided colon cancer (OR 1.64, 95\u200a%CI 1.02\u200a-\u200a2.64), \u2265\u200a1 advanced adenoma at index colonoscopy (OR 1.90, 95\u200a%CI 1.05\u200a-\u200a3.43), and \u2265\u200a1 adenoma at first surveillance colonoscopy (OR 2.06, 95\u200a%CI 1.29\u200a-\u200a3.27) were independently predictive of metachronous colorectal neoplasms at second surveillance colonoscopy. For patients without such risk factors, diagnostic accuracy parameters were: 89.3\u200a% (95\u200a%CI 82.0\u200a%-94.3\u200a%) and 78.2\u200a% (95\u200a%CI 65.0\u200a%-88.2\u200a%) sensitivity, and 28.5\u200a% (95\u200a%CI 23.5\u200a%-33.9\u200a%) and 33.8\u200a% (95\u200a%CI 26.2\u200a%-42.0\u200a%) specificity in derivation and validation group, respectively. No cancer would be missed.Patients with prior left-sided colon cancer or \u2265\u200a1 advanced adenoma at index colonoscopy or \u2265\u200a1 adenoma at first surveillance colonoscopy had a significantly higher risk of neoplasms at second surveillance colonoscopy; patients without such factors had much lower risk and could safely skip the second surveillance colonoscopy. A prospective, multicenter validation study is needed."

    "content": "The global population of older cancer survivors is growing. However, the intersections of aging-related health risks across the cancer control continuum are poorly understood, limiting the integration of aging into cancer control research and practice. The objective of this study was to review the state of science and provide future directions to improve the quality of evidence in 6 priority research areas in cancer and aging.The authors identified priority research areas in cancer and aging through an evidence-based Research Jam process involving 32 investigators and trainees from multiple disciplines and research centers in aging and cancer; then, they conducted a narrative review of the state of the science and future directions to improve the quality of evidence in these research areas. Priority research areas were defined as those in which gaps in scientific evidence or clinical practice limit the health and well-being of older adults with cancer.Six priority research areas were identified: cognitive and physical functional outcomes of older cancer survivors, sampling issues in studies of older cancer survivors, risk and resilience across the lifespan, caregiver support and well-being, quality of care for older patients with cancer, and health disparities. Evidence in these areas could be improved through the incorporation of bias reduction techniques into longitudinal studies of older cancer survivors, novel data linkage, and improved representation of older adults in cancer research.The priority research areas and methodologies identified here may be used to guide interdisciplinary research and improve the quality of evidence on cancer and aging."

Understanding the burden and trends of HPV-attributable cancers is crucial to HPV prevention strategies. In the current study, the authors estimated the latest burden and trends of HPV-attributable cancers in China.Data from the following sources were used. The number of new cancer cases and cancer deaths in China were estimated based on the China Cancer Registry Annual Report. The population-attributable fraction was estimated using pooled high-risk HPV prevalence and biomarker-positive rates, which were calculated using random effects meta-analyses. Cancer burden estimates were stratified by anatomic site, sex, and age.In 2015, a total of 110,650 new cancer cases and 36,714 cancer deaths attributable to HPV infection were estimated to have occurred in China, of which cervical cancer accounted for 85.6% and 78.1%, respectively. The age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) of HPV-attributable cancers were 5.63 and 1.81 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. The ASIR and ASMR both varied by anatomic site, with the highest rates noted for cervical cancer at 4.83 and 1.42 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. Between 2005 and 2015, the ASIR and ASMR demonstrated significant upward trends for all HPV-attributable cancers combined.Between 2005 and 2015, cervical cancer accounted for the vast majority of HPV-attributable cancers and its incidence\u00a0and mortality increased rapidly in China. The comprehensive prevention of cervical cancer remains the most important target in the prevention of HPV-attributable cancers."

    "content": "Depressive symptoms in patients with cancer are associated with poor quality of life and decreased survival. Although inflammation is reliably associated with depression in otherwise healthy individuals, the association in patients with cancer remains unclear. Given the high prevalence of cancer-related inflammation, the authors aimed to establish the relationship between inflammation and depression in cancer patients based on extant literature.A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 guidelines and registered under Prospero ID CRD42021226743. Three databases were searched including PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO using the following criteria for inclusion: 1) measurement of a peripheral inflammatory marker, 2) use of a validated tool/scale to measure depression, and 3) a cancer diagnosis. Risk of publication bias was assessed by Funnel plot and Egger test.Seventy-three studies were included in the systematic review and 54 studies (n\u00a0=\u00a05017) were included in meta-analyses. Associations with depressive symptoms were significant for peripheral blood interleukin (IL)-6 (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35-0.82), I<sup>2</sup> \u00a0=\u00a057.9%; tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (SMD\u00a0=\u00a00.73; 95% CI, 0.35-1.11), I<sup>2</sup> \u00a0=\u00a074.1%; and C-reactive protein (CRP) (SMD\u00a0=\u00a00.57; 95% CI, 0.27-0.87), I<sup>2</sup> \u00a0=\u00a00%. IL-5, IL-13, albumin, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were associated with depressive symptoms but based on fewer studies. Most cancer settings were represented; the number of studies per inflammatory marker varied from 1 to 52.Although peripheral inflammatory markers were unevenly studied, the most studied markers (IL-6, TNF, and CRP) were associated with depressive symptoms in cancer patients and may be useful for management of depressive symptoms in the cancer setting.Peripheral blood inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF, and CRP) were associated with depressive symptoms in various cancer settings. Although further studies are warranted, these findings may help identify and manage depressive symptoms in patients with cancer."

We describe cancer-related nutrition and meal planning information from Pinterest.In June 2020, we searched Pinterest using \"cancer recipe\" and \"recipe for cancer\" at 3 times daily for 2 weeks. Duplicates were removed for a final sample of n = 103 pins. Each pin was coded for 58 variables including descriptives, cancer claims (eg, treatment, prevention, and cure), and nutrition claims (eg, \"turmeric cures cancer\"). We summarized each variable to describe the content of cancer nutrition claims on Pinterest and examined associations between claim types and contextual factors, including the use of academic citations, disclaimers, and personal anecdotes.Pinners had on average 116,767 followers (range, 0-1.5 million). Almost half of content sites were for profit (48.5%) and 34% were selling a product. Health claims were common, with content that purported to prevent (41.8%), treat (27.2%), or cure (10.7%) cancer. Vague phrases such as \"anti-cancer,\" \"cancer-fighting,\" or \"cancer-busting\" were also used. The inclusion of validity indicators including academic citations, disclaimers, and personal anecdotes varied significantly by the types of claims made. Together, these analyses informed the development of a conceptual framework of cancer-related nutrition misinformation.There are clear financial incentives for the promotion of cancer nutrition information online. More research is needed to understand how exposure to nutrition information can influence patient/caregiver behavior and downstream clinical and psychosocial outcomes."

    "content": "The high incidence of metachronous colorectal tumours in patients with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) encourages extended resection (ER); however, the optimal surgical approach remains unclear. We evaluated the incidences of metachronous colorectal neoplasms following curative colorectal cancer segmental resection (SR) vs ER in patients with HNPCC and investigated patients' oncologic outcomes according to surgical modality and mismatch repair status.We retrospectively investigated medical records of patients with HNPCC (per the Amsterdam II criteria) treated for primary colon cancer at our institution between 2001 and 2017. All patients underwent intensive endoscopic surveillance.We included 87 patients (36 who underwent SR and 51 who underwent ER). The cumulative incidence of metachronous adenoma was higher in the SR group. One patient in the SR group (2.8%) and 3 in the ER group (5.9%) developed metachronous colon cancer; the difference was not significant (P\u2009=\u20090.693). Four patients in the SR group (11.1%) and 1 in the ER group (2.0%) developed distant recurrences; again, the difference was not significant (P\u2009=\u20090.155). Moreover, no significant differences were observed in the 5-year overall survival rates of patients in the SR and ER groups (88.2% vs 95.5%, P\u2009=\u20090.446); the same was true for 5-year disease-free survival rates (79.5% vs 91.0%, P\u2009=\u20090.147).The incidence of metachronous cancer was not significantly different between the ER and SR groups; however, that of cumulative metachronous adenoma was higher in the SR group. Hence, intensive surveillance colonoscopy may be sufficient for patients with HNPCC after non-extensive colon resection."

These sites share their insights on implementation and expansion of their patient navigation efforts.Patient navigation represents an evidence-based health care intervention designed to enhance patient-centered care and care coordination. Investigators at 6 National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers outline their approaches to reducing health care disparities and synthesize their efforts to ensure sustainability and successful transferability in the management of patients with cancer and their families in real-world health care settings.Insights are outlined within the context of patient navigation program effectiveness and supported by examples from Alliance cancer center sites: 1) understand the patient populations, particularly underserved and high-risk patients; 2) capitalize on the existing infrastructure and institutional commitment to support and sustain patient navigation; and 3) build capacity by mobilizing community support outside of the cancer center.This process-level article reflects the importance of collaboration and the usefulness of partnering with other cancer centers to share interdisciplinary insights while undergoing intervention development, implementation, and expansion. These collective insights may be useful to staff at other cancer centers that look to implement, enhance, or evaluate the effectiveness of their patient navigation interventions."

These patients were sent a paper-based questionnaire that contained 45 questions regarding demographics and 4 functions of internet use: content, communication, community, and e-health.The response in 2017 (53%) was lower than that in 2005 (75%). Survivors browsed the internet most frequently to search for information regarding cancer shortly after being diagnosed and while waiting for treatment. There was little change noted with regard to the relative importance attached to the various subjects. In 2017, significant increases were evident with regard to finances (+33%), health care insurance (+29%), and genetics and/or heritability (+27%). The wishes expressed in 2005 by patients were realized in part in 2017.A significant sample of cancer survivors in the Netherlands have indicated that the internet is an important source of information regarding their illness. However, little change was evident over the past 15\u00a0years with regard to patients' priorities regarding their wishes for internet use. The wishes of users in 2005 were found to accurately reflect the internet use of the majority of patients in 2017. The results of the current study support the belief that health care professionals should expand their online services and tailor them toward the needs and wishes of their patients."

    "content": "Young adult cancer survivors experience frailty and decreased muscle mass at rates equivalent to much older noncancer populations, which indicate accelerated aging. Although frailty and low muscle mass can be identified in survivors, their implications for health-related quality of life are not well understood.Through a cross-sectional analysis of young adult cancer survivors, frailty was assessed with the Fried frailty phenotype and skeletal muscle mass in relation to functional and quality of life outcomes measured by the Medical Outcomes Survey Short-Form 36 (SF-36). z tests compared survivors with US population means, and multivariable linear regression models estimated mean SF-36 scores by frailty and muscle mass with adjustments made for comorbidities, sex, and time from treatment.Sixty survivors (median age, 21\u00a0years; range, 18-29) participated in the study. Twenty-five (42%) had low muscle mass, and 25 were either frail or prefrail. Compared with US population means, survivors reported worse health and functional impairments across SF-36 domains that were more common among survivors with (pre)frailty or low muscle mass. In multivariable linear modeling, (pre)frail survivors (vs nonfrail) exhibited lower mean scores for general health (-9.1; P\u00a0=\u00a0.05), physical function (-14.9; P\u00a0<\u00a0.01), and overall physical health (-5.6; P\u00a0=\u00a0.02) independent of comorbid conditions.Measures of frailty and skeletal muscle mass identify subgroups of young adult cancer survivors with significantly impaired health, functional status, and quality of life independent of medical comorbidities. Identifying survivors with frailty or low muscle mass may provide opportunities for interventions to prevent functional and health declines or to reverse this process.Young adult cancer survivors age more quickly than peers without cancer, which is evidenced by a syndrome of decreased resilience known as frailty. The relationship between frailty (and one of its common components, decreased muscle mass) and quality of life among young adult cancer survivors was examined. Measuring decreased muscle mass and frailty identifies young survivors with poor quality of life, including worse general health, fatigue, physical function, and overall physical health, compared with nonfrail survivors. Interventions to address components of frailty (low muscle mass and weakness) may improve function and quality of life among young adult cancer survivors."

    "content": "Despite the biopsychosocial underpinnings of chronic noncancer pain, relatively little is known about the contribution of psychosocial factors to chronic cancer pain. The authors aimed to characterize associations between biopsychosocial factors and pain and opioid use among individuals with chronic pain and cancer.The authors conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional study of 700 patients with chronic pain and cancer seeking treatment at an academic tertiary pain clinic. Patients completed demographic questionnaires and validated psychosocial and pain measures. Multivariable, hierarchical linear and logistic regressions assessed the relative contributions of biopsychosocial factors to the primary dependent variables of pain severity, pain interference, and opioid use.Participants were 62% female and 66% White with a mean age of 59 \u00b1 15 years, and 55% held a college degree or higher. Older age, African American or \"other\" race, sleep disturbance, and pain catastrophizing were significantly associated with higher pain severity (F(5,657) = 22.45; P \u2264 .001; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.22). Depression, sleep disturbance, pain catastrophizing, lower emotional support, and higher pain severity were significantly associated with pain interference (F(5,653) = 9.47; P \u2264 .001; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.44). Lastly, a poor cancer prognosis (Exp(B) = 1.62) and sleep disturbance (Exp(B) = 1.02) were associated with taking opioids, whereas identifying as Asian (Exp(B) = 0.48) or Hispanic (Exp(B) = 0.47) was associated with lower odds of using opioids.Modifiable psychological factors-specifically sleep disturbance, depression, and pain catastrophizing-were uniquely associated with pain and opioid use in patients with chronic pain and diverse cancer diagnoses. Future behavioral pain interventions that concurrently target sleep may improve pain among patients with cancer.Feeling depressed, worrying about pain, and bad sleep are related to higher pain symptoms in individuals with chronic pain and cancer. Specifically, those who struggle to sleep have worse pain and use more opioids. Also, individuals who have a bad prognosis for their cancer are more likely to be using opioid pain medications. Although race and cancer are related to chronic pain in patients, psychological well-being is also strongly related to this same pain."

    "content": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries collaborate to provide annual updates on cancer occurrence and trends in the United States and to address a special topic of interest. Part I of this report focuses on national cancer statistics, and part 2 characterizes progress in achieving select Healthy People 2020 cancer objectives.For this report, the authors selected objectives-including death rates, cancer screening, and major risk factors-related to 4 common cancers (lung, colorectal, female breast, and prostate). Baseline values, recent values, and the percentage change from baseline to recent values were examined overall and by select sociodemographic characteristics. Data from national surveillance systems were obtained from the Healthy People 2020 website.Targets for death rates were met overall and in most sociodemographic groups, but not among males, blacks, or individuals in rural areas, although these groups did experience larger decreases in rates compared with other groups. During 2007 through 2017, cancer death rates decreased 15% overall, ranging from -4% (rural) to -22% (metropolitan). Targets for breast and colorectal cancer screening were not yet met overall or in any sociodemographic groups except those with the highest educational attainment, whereas lung cancer screening was generally low (<10%). Targets were not yet met overall for cigarette smoking, recent smoking cessation, excessive alcohol use, or obesity but were met for secondhand smoke exposure and physical activity. Some sociodemographic groups did not meet targets or had less improvement than others toward reaching objectives.Monitoring trends in cancer risk factors, screening test use, and mortality can help assess the progress made toward decreasing the cancer burden in the United States. Although many interventions to reduce cancer risk factors and promote healthy behaviors are proven to work, they may not be equitably applied or work well in every community. Implementing cancer prevention and control interventions that are sustainable, focused, and culturally appropriate may boost success in communities with the greatest need, ensuring that all Americans can access a path to long, healthy, cancer-free lives."

    "content": "Cancer and its treatment damage the musculoskeletal system and induce neurotoxicity, affecting the key sensory inputs for maintaining balance. The present study describes the pattern of balance impairment and evaluated its association with mortality among US cancer survivors.Data on a nationally representative sample of cancer survivors from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999 to 2015 was analyzed. Sensory-specific balance impairment was measured at baseline by the modified Romberg test of standing balance on firm and compliant support surfaces. The linked mortality data were updated through December 31, 2015.Among 511 cancer survivors, 282 (48.3%) had a balance impairment, predominantly attributing to vestibular dysfunction (251; 89.0% of 282 and 44.5% of 511). A higher prevalence of balance impairment was observed among cancer survivors with advanced age, lower socioeconomic status or educational attainment, body mass index <25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> , and an inactive lifestyle. During up to 16.4 years of follow-up (median, 11.3 years; 5088 person-years), 253 cancer survivors had died. Cancer survivors with a balance impairment had a 63% higher risk of death from all causes (hazard ratio, 1.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-2.38) after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, comorbidities, and cancer type. Specifically, those with vestibular dysfunctions had approximately 1.54 (95% CI, 1.05-2.27) times the risk of death compared to those without any balance impairment. These associations were stronger in males than in females.In a US nationally representative sample of cancer survivors, balance impairment and vestibular dysfunctions were prevalent and associated with heightened all-cause mortality."

    "content": "There is some evidence that place of residence is associated with cancer survival, but the findings are inconsistent, and the underlying mechanisms by which residential location might affect survival are not well understood. We conducted a systematic review of observational studies investigating the association of rural versus urban residence with cancer survival in high-income countries. We searched the Ovid Medline, EMBASE, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) databases up to May 31, 2016. Forty-five studies published between 1984 and 2016 were included. We extracted unadjusted and adjusted relative risk estimates with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Most studies reported worse survival for cancer patients living in rural areas than those in urban regions. The most consistent evidence, observed across several studies, was for colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer. Of the included studies, 18 did not account for socio-economic position. Lower survival for more disadvantaged patients is well documented; therefore, it could be beneficial for future research to take socio-economic factors into consideration when assessing rural/urban differences in cancer survival. Some studies cited differential stage at diagnosis and treatment modalities as major contributing factors to regional inequalities in cancer survival. Further research is needed to disentangle the mediating effects of these factors, which may help to establish effective interventions to improve survival for patients living outside major cities."

    "content": "Nowadays, evaluation of the efficacy and the duration of treatment, in context of monitoring patients with solid tumors, is based on the RECIST methodology. With these criteria, resistance and/or insensitivity are defined as tumor non-response which does not allow a good understanding of the diversity of the underlying mechanisms. The main objective of the OncoSNIPE\u00ae collaborative clinical research program is to identify early and late markers of resistance to treatment.Multicentric, interventional study with the primary objective to identify early and / or late markers of resistance to treatment, in 600 adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic triple negative or Luminal B breast cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer or pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Patients targeted in this study have all rapid progression of their pathology, making it possible to obtain models for evaluating markers of early and / or late responses over the 2-year period of follow-up, and thus provide the information necessary to understand resistance mechanisms. To explore the phenomena of resistance, during therapeutic response and / or progression of the pathology, we will use a multidisciplinary approach including high-throughput sequencing (Exome-seq and RNAseq), clinical data, medical images and immunological profile by ELISA. Patients will have long-term follow-up with different biological samples, at baseline (blood and biopsy) and at each tumoral evaluation or tumoral progression evaluated by medical imaging. Clinical data will be collected through a dedicated Case Report Form (CRF) and enriched by semantic extraction based on the French ConSoRe (Continuum Soins Recherche) initiative, a dedicated Semantic Clinical Data Warehouse (SCDW) to cancer. The study is sponsored by Oncodesign (Dijon, France) and is currently ongoing.The great diversity of intrinsic or acquired molecular mechanisms involved in resistance to treatment constitutes a real therapeutic issue. Improving understanding of mechanisms of resistance of cancer cells to anti-tumor treatments is therefore a major challenge. The OncoSNIPE cohort will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of resistance and will allow to explore new mechanisms of actions and to discover new therapeutic targets or strategies making it possible to circumvent the escape in different types of cancer.Clinicaltrial.gov.

    "content": "Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Its high mortality rate results from lack of adequate and sensitive methods allowing for the detection of the early stages of the disease, as well as low efficiency of the treatment, caused by the cytotoxic drug resistance of cancer cells. Unfortunately, tumours are able to develop new pathways and protective mechanisms that allow them to survive toxic conditions of chemotherapy. Therefore, intensive search for new genes and proteins involved in resistance to cytotoxic drugs is still needed, especially from a clinical point of view. The article presents an overview of the available literature on the role of semaphorin 3A (SEMA3A), protocadherin 9 (PCDH9), and S100 calcium binding protein A3 (S100A3) in carcinogenesis and chemoresistance of various tumors including ovarian cancer. As it turns out, the role of described genes/proteins is not limited only to their native biological activity but they function also as an oncogenic or suppressor factors in the tumor development. Moreover, they can also play an important role in development of drug resistance, as it was shown in ovarian cancer cell lines."

This study aimed to examine the validity of self-reported diagnosis of cancer among the JNHS cohort members (N=15,019).For women who reported any diagnosis of five cancers (stomach, colorectal, liver, lung and thyroid) in the biennial follow-up surveys, an additional outcome survey, medical facility survey, and confirmation of death certificate (DC) were conducted. The JNHS Validation Study Committee (referred to as \"the committee\") made a final decision on the reported outcomes. To examine the validity of self-reported diagnosis of cancer, the positive predictive value (PPV) was calculated using the committee's decision as the gold standard. To examine the validity of the committee's decision based on self-reports and DCs, PPV was calculated using physician-reported information as the gold standard.The PPV of self-reported diagnosis in the biennial follow-up surveys was 77.8% for stomach, 66.2% for colorectal, 41.7% for liver, 60.2% for lung, and 64.6% for thyroid cancer. The corresponding PPVs in the additional outcome survey were 96.2%, 80.7%, 62.5%, 82.5%, and 96.9%, respectively. The PPV of the committee's decision was 100% for stomach, 87.5% for colorectal, 94.7% for lung, and 100% for thyroid cancer (data not available for liver cancer). The proportion of DC-only cases among committee-defined cases was below 10% for all cancers except liver cancer (28.6%).The validity of identifying cancer diagnosis based on self-reported information in the JNHS was favorable for stomach, colorectal, lung and thyroid cancer."

Descriptive statistics, \u03c7<sup>2</sup> statistics, and t tests were used to compare nonclinical (eg, community health worker) and clinical (eg, nurse navigators) navigators on the provision of various navigation services, personal characteristics, engagement in the cancer care continuum, and program characteristics.Most participants were clinical navigators (76.1%). Compared to nonclinical navigators, clinical navigators were more likely to have a bachelor's degree or higher (88.6% vs 69.6%, P < .001), be funded by operational budgets (84.4% vs 35.7%, P < .001), and less likely to work at a community-based organization or nonprofit (2.0% vs 36.5%, P < .001). Clinical navigators were more likely to perform basic navigation (P < .001), care coordination (P < .001), treatment support (P < .001), and clinical trial/peer support (P = .005). Clinical navigators were more likely to engage in treatment (P < .001), end-of-life (P < .001), and palliative care (P = .001) navigation.There is growing indication that clinical and nonclinical oncology navigators perform different functions and work in different settings. Nonclinical navigators may be more likely to face job insecurity because they work in nonprofit organizations and are primarily funded by grants."

Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to examine the association of new statin use in the 12 months after a breast cancer diagnosis with overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS).When examining incident statin use, defined as the initiation of statin therapy in the 12 months after breast cancer diagnosis, a significant association was observed between statin use and improved BCSS (standardized hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20-0.88; P = .022) and OS (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.50-0.99; P = .046) among patients with TNBC (n = 1534). No association was observed with BCSS (standardized hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.71-1.39; P = .97) or OS (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.92-1.17; P = .55) among those without TNBC (n = 15,979). The results were consistent when examining statin exposure as a time-varying variable.Among women with I, II, and III TNBC, initiation of statin therapy in the 12 months after breast cancer diagnosis was associated with an OS and BCSS benefit. Statins may have a role in select patients with breast cancer, and further investigation is warranted."

    "content": "The long-term impact of affordable care organizations (ACOs) on cancer spending remains unknown. The authors examined whether practices that became ACOs altered their spending for patients with cancer in the first 4 years after ACO implementation.By using national Medicare data from 2011 to 2017, a random sample of 20% of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older with cancer was obtained (n = 866,532), and each patient was assigned to a practice. Practices that became ACOs in the Medicare Shared Savings Program were matched to non-ACO practices. Total, cancer-specific, and service category-specific yearly spending per patient was calculated. A difference-in-differences model was used to determine spending changes associated with ACO status for patients with cancer in the 4 years after ACO implementation.The introduction of ACOs did not have a significant impact on overall spending for patients with cancer in the 2 years after ACO implementation (difference, -$38; 95% CI, -$268, $191; P = .74). Changes in spending also did not differ between ACO and non-ACO patients within service categories or among the 11 cancer types examined. The lack of difference in spending for patients with cancer in ACO and non-ACO practices persisted in the third and fourth years after ACO implementation (difference, -$120; 95% CI, -$284, $525; P = .56).ACOs did not significantly change spending for patients with cancer in the first 4 years after their implementation compared with non-ACOs. This prompts a reevaluation of the current efficacy of ACOs in reducing spending for cancer care and may encourage policymakers to reconsider the incentive structures of ACOs.Accountable care organizations (ACOs) were developed to curtail health care spending and improve quality, but their effects on cancer spending in their first 2 years have been minimal. The long-term impact of ACOs on cancer spending remains unknown. By using data from 866,532 Medicare beneficiaries with cancer, the authors observed that the association of a practice with an ACO did not significantly change total yearly spending per patient in the first 4 years after ACO implementation. This finding prompts a reevaluation of the current efficacy of ACOs in reducing spending for cancer care."

In Caucasians, compared to the carrier rate of 3.15% (12\u2009357/392274) in noncancer subjects, the rate was significantly higher in cancer patients overall (2621/79619 = 3.29%), especially in patients with colorectal cancer (247/6667 = 3.70%), cancers of gallbladder and biliary tract (21/351 = 5.98%), thyroid cancer (30/665 = 4.51%) and unspecified non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (74/1805 = 4.10%), all P \u2264\u2009.05. In contrast, the carrier rate in patients with cancers of lung and bronchus was significantly lower (89/3463 = 2.57%), P =\u2009.05. The association of CFTR F508del carriers with these types of cancer remained significant after adjusting for respective cancer-specific risk factors. For pancreatic cancer, although a higher carrier rate (38/1004 = 3.78%) was found in patients with this cancer, the difference was not statistically significant (P\u2009= .26). This null association was unlikely due to lack of statistical power; the large sample size of our study had >80% power, at a significance level of .05, to detect an association of >1.5-fold increased risk. In conclusion, the identified associations of CFTR F508del carriers with multiple types of cancer may have potential biological and clinical implications if confirmed in independent study populations."

The purpose of our study was to analyse the cancer stage distribution data of Georgia as a first step towards identifying the areas of early cancer detection in the country that might need improvement or require further research.Descriptive analysis of the population-based cancer registry of Georgia was performed using the data for the period of 01.01.2018-31.12.2019.Around 57\u00a0% of cancers in males and 56\u00a0% of cancers in females were amenable to early detection. At least 35.7\u00a0% of these cancers in males and 44.2\u00a0% in females were detected early. 15.2\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a0964) of male and 35.3\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a03179) of female cancer patients met the age criteria for the respective cancer screening programmes. Breast, colorectal, cervical and stomach cancers contributed to 58.7\u00a0% of all late-stage cancers in females. Lung, prostate, colorectal, laryngeal and stomach cancers made up 72.4\u00a0% of all late-stage cancer cases among males. At least 83.8\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a01438) of thyroid cancers in females and 84.2\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a0246) of thyroid cancers in males were diagnosed at stage I. Moreover, stage I thyroid cancer cases made up 50.7\u00a0% of all stage I cancer cases detected in women and 25.6\u00a0% of all stage I cancers in men. At least 42.4\u00a0% of stage I thyroid cancers in females and 37.4\u00a0% of stage I thyroid cancers in males were papillary microcarcinomas.The potential of early cancer detection is underutilised in Georgia and there is a need to strengthen screening and especially early diagnosis in the country. The possibility of thyroid cancer overdiagnosis requires further investigation."

    "content": "Young adult (YA) cancer survivors are at risk for financial toxicity during and after cancer treatment. Financial toxicity has been associated with medical-related cost-coping behaviors such as skipping or delaying treatment. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in dire economic consequences that may worsen financial hardship among young survivors.This was a cross-sectional survey; data collection occurred online. A convenience sample was recruited through YA cancer advocacy groups and social media. Negative economic events associated with the COVID-19 pandemic (eg, income loss, increased debt, and decreased job security) and medical-related cost-coping were documented. A validated measure assessed cancer-related financial toxicity.Participants (N = 212) had a mean age of 35.3 years at survey completion and a mean age of 27.4 years at diagnosis. Financial toxicity (mean, 14.0; SD, 9.33) was high. Two-thirds of the sample experienced at least 1 negative economic event during COVID-19, and 71% engaged in at least 1 medical cost-coping behavior. Cost-coping and pandemic-related negative economic events were significantly correlated with cancer-related financial toxicity. In multivariable analyses, pandemic-related negative economic events and financial toxicity were associated with cost-coping.Acute negative economic events associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate cancer-related financial toxicity and overall financial hardship among YAs and lead to cost-coping behaviors that can compromise survivorship care and health outcomes. Multilevel, systematic interventions are needed to address the financial needs of YA survivors after the global pandemic."

This study estimates the excess health care utilization and medical spending associated with overweight and obesity among long-term cancer survivors.Long-term cancer survivors (\u22652 years after their diagnosis) aged \u226518 years (N = 12,547) were identified from the nationally representative 2008-2016 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. A 2-part modeling approach was used to calculate the average annual care utilization and spending by service type. Excess care utilization and spending associated with overweight (25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> \u2264 body mass index [BMI] < 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> ), obesity (BMI \u2265 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> ), and severe obesity (BMI \u2265 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> ), in comparison with normal weight (18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> \u2264 BMI < 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> ), were estimated.Compared with normal-weight cancer survivors, overweight survivors had comparable care utilization and medical spending; survivors with obesity had an additional $3216 (95% CI, $1940-$4492) of medical spending, including $1243 (95% CI, $417-$2070) on hospital inpatient services and $1130 (95% CI, $756-$1504) on prescriptions per person per year. The excess annual medical spending associated with obesity among long-term cancer survivors translated to $19.7 billion in 2016 in the United States. The excess medical spending was magnified in cancer survivors with severe obesity ($5317 [95% CI, $2849-$7785], which translated to $6.7 billion in 2016). Excess care utilization and medical spending were mostly explained by comorbid conditions related to obesity.For long-term cancer survivors, obesity was associated with increased health care utilization and substantial excess medical spending. This suggests that policies and practices promoting a healthy lifestyle and achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight for cancer survivors may reduce their health care utilization and economic burden."

Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between HRQOL and all-cause mortality.HRQOL, assessed an average of 4.9 years after the cancer diagnosis (standard deviation of 1.9 years), was negatively associated with a higher cancer stage at diagnosis; a higher comorbidity score at the survey; experience of surgical complications; dissatisfaction with breast surgery; and experience of any recent recurrence, metastasis, or secondary malignancy. Since the completion of the survey, there were 85 deaths (3.5%) during a mean follow-up of 4 years (standard deviation of 0.5 years). In multivariate models, decreases in PROMIS physical T scores and mental T scores were associated with increased mortality (HR for physical T scores, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.05-1.11; HR for mental T scores, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06).Prognostic and cancer treatment-related factors affect HRQOL in breast cancer survivors and may inform targeted survivorship care. PROMIS global health measures may offer additional insights into patients' well-being and mortality risk.Findings from a study suggest that prognostic and cancer treatment-related factors affect health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in breast cancer survivors and that poor HRQOL may increase the mortality risk. The evaluation of HRQOL is important because it may hold potential as a tool for optimizing survivorship care."

    "title": "Utility of a Cancer Predisposition Screening Tool for Predicting Subsequent Malignant Neoplasms in Childhood Cancer Survivors.",
    "content": "Childhood cancer survivors (CCS) are at risk of developing subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMNs) resulting from exposure to prior therapies. CCS with underlying cancer predisposition syndromes are at additional genetic risk of SMN development. The McGill Interactive Pediatric OncoGenetic Guidelines (MIPOGG) tool identifies children with cancer at increased likelihood of having a cancer predisposition syndrome, guiding clinicians through a series of Yes or No questions that generate a recommendation for or against genetic evaluation. We evaluated MIPOGG's ability to predict SMN development in CCS.Using the provincial cancer registry (Ontario, Canada), and adopting a nested case-control approach, we identified CCS diagnosed and/or treated for a primary malignancy before age 18 years (1986-2015). CCS who developed an SMN (cases) were matched, by primary cancer and year of diagnosis, with CCS who did not develop an SMN (controls) over the same period (1:5 ratio). Potential predictors for SMN development (chemotherapy, radiation, and MIPOGG output) were applied retrospectively using clinical data pertaining to the first malignancy. Conditional logistic regression models estimated hazard ratios and 95% CIs associated with each covariate, alone and in combination, for SMN development.Of 13,367 children with a primary cancer, 317 (2.4%) developed an SMN and were matched to 1,569 controls. A MIPOGG output recommending evaluation was significantly associated with SMN development (hazard ratio 1.53; 95% CI, 1.06 to 2.19) in a multivariable model that included primary cancer therapy exposures. MIPOGG was predictive of SMN development, showing value in nonhematologic malignancies and in CCS not exposed to radiation.MIPOGG has additional value for SMN prediction beyond treatment exposures and may be beneficial in decision making for enhanced individualized SMN surveillance strategies for CCS."

    "content": "Cancer survivors develop other chronic medical conditions because of shared risk factors and delayed effects of cancer treatment. This study investigated trends in the prevalence of chronic diseases and estimated their population sizes among adult cancer survivors in the United States from 2002 to 2018.Using 2002-2018 National Health Interview Survey data, this study calculated the age-sex-race/ethnicity-adjusted prevalences and estimated the population sizes for the following chronic conditions among cancer survivors: hypertension, diabetes, stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/asthma, hepatitis, arthritis, liver disease, kidney disease, and morbid obesity. This study also examined multiple chronic conditions (MCC; 3 or more health conditions). MCC trends were further examined by sociodemographic factors to identify high-risk populations. Parallel analyses were performed for participants without a cancer history to provide a reference.Among 30,728 cancers survivors, increasing trends were observed in the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease, and morbid obesity, whereas decreasing prevalence trends were observed for ischemic heart disease, COPD, and hepatitis. Cancer survivors with MCC increased from 4.7 million in 2002 to 8.1 million in 2018 (the prevalence increased from 43.7% to 46.6%). The increase was more pronounced among survivors aged 18 to 44 years. Among adults without a cancer history, the MCC prevalence also increased, although more slowly than among survivors.The number of adult cancer survivors in the United States with comorbid illnesses has increased substantially over the past 2 decades. Optimal management of comorbid conditions and aggressive interventions for risk reduction may benefit the cancer survivor population."

    "content": "There is a lack of evidence-based recommendations for the age at which women with a family history of cancers other than breast cancer should start breast cancer screening.Using Swedish family cancer data sets, the authors conducted a nationwide cohort study including 5,099,172 Swedish women born after 1931 (follow-up, 1958-2015). Accounting for calendar time, they calculated the relative risk of breast cancer for women with a family history of a discordant cancer in 1 first-degree relative. Furthermore, the authors used 10-year cumulative risk to determine the ages at which women with a family history of discordant cancer reached risk thresholds at which women in the general population were recommended to start breast cancer screening.A family history of cancer at 15 sites was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Among women younger than 50 years, the highest risk of breast cancer was observed for those with a family history of ovarian cancer (standardized incidence ratio, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-1.64). In these women, the risk of breast cancer associated with a family history at other cancer sites ranged from 1.08-fold for prostate cancer to 1.18-fold for liver cancer. When breast cancer screening was recommended to be started at the age of 50 years for the general population, women with 1 first-degree relative with ovarian cancer attained the threshold risk for screening at the age of 46 years. Women with a family history of other discordant cancers did not reach the risk thresholds for screening at younger ages.Many cancers showed familial associations with breast cancer, but women with a family history of these cancers (except for ovarian cancer) did not reach risk thresholds for screening at younger ages."

    "content": "The authors describe the incidence and characteristics of secondary malignant neoplasms (SMNs) in adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors compared with those in younger and older cancer survivors.Children aged \u2264 14 years, AYAs aged 15 to 39, and older adults aged \u2265 40 years at the time of primary diagnosis who were reported as cancer survivors in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program between 1973 and 2011 were compared in this population-based analysis. The primary analysis was the risk that an SMN would occur \u2265 5 years after the original diagnosis for patients who had the more common AYA cancers (leukemia, lymphoma, testicular malignancy, ovarian malignancy, melanoma, and cancers of the thyroid, breast, soft tissue, or bone). The standardized incidence ratio (SIR), absolute excess risk (AER), and cumulative incidence of SMN for the selected cancers were assessed. The risk of SMN for the entire cohort also was analyzed.Of the 148,558 AYA survivors who were diagnosed with a selected cancer, 7384 developed an SMN 5 years after their original diagnosis. The SIRs (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were 1.58 (95% CI, 1.55-1.62) for AYAs, 4.26 (95% CI, 3.77-4.80) for children, and 1.10 (95% CI, 1.09-1.11) for older adults, and the AERs were 22.9, 16.6, and 14.7, respectively. The cumulative incidence of SMN at 30 years was 13.9% for the AYA group. The most common SMNs in AYAs were breast cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, genital cancers, and melanoma. AYAs who had received radiation therapy had a higher cumulative incidence of SMN.AYAs who survive cancer for more than 5 years have a higher relative risk of SMN compared with the general population and have a higher absolute risk of SMN compared with younger or older cancer survivors."

    "content": "Cancer-related cognitive impairment is a prevalent, disruptive condition potentially exacerbated by sleep disturbances. The current study was performed to evaluate the effects of acupuncture versus cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) on objective and subjective cognitive function in cancer survivors with insomnia.Using data from a randomized clinical trial (160 survivors) that compared acupuncture versus CBT-I for insomnia occurring in cancer survivors, the authors analyzed cognitive outcomes and their relationship to insomnia symptoms. Analysis was limited to 99 patients who reported baseline cognitive difficulties. Interventions were delivered over 8\u00a0weeks. Objective attention, learning, and memory were evaluated using the Buschke Selective Reminding Test. Subjective cognitive function was assessed using the Brown Attention-Deficit Disorder Scales. Insomnia symptoms were assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index. All outcomes were collected at baseline, week 8, and week 20.From baseline to week 8, acupuncture produced statistically significant within-group improvements in objective attention (Cohen D, 0.29), learning (Cohen D, 0.31), and memory (Cohen D, 0.33) that persisted to week 20 (all P\u00a0<\u00a0.05), whereas CBT-I produced a statistically significant within-group improvement in objective attention from baseline to week 20 (Cohen D, 0.50; P\u00a0<\u00a0.05); between-group differences were not statistically significant. Both interventions produced statistically significant within-group improvements in subjective cognitive function at weeks 8 and 20 compared with baseline (all P\u00a0<\u00a0.001); between-group differences were not statistically significant. In the acupuncture group, patients with clinically meaningful responses with regard to insomnia symptoms demonstrated a significantly greater improvement in subjective cognitive function compared with those without clinically meaningful insomnia responses (P\u00a0=\u00a0.006).Among cancer survivors with insomnia, both acupuncture and CBT-I produced significant improvements in objective and subjective cognitive function. However, the effect sizes varied and only survivors in the acupuncture group demonstrated a significant relationship between cognitive and sleep outcomes. These preliminary findings warrant further investigation to guide the personalized management of patients with cancer-related cognitive impairment."

    "content": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused enormous strain on public health. Patients with cancer are particularly susceptible to the disease, and their treatment plans have been threatened by public health restrictions designed to contain the spread.This study examined the effects of the pandemic on cancer patients' psychology, knowledge, attitudes, and practices concerning COVID-19 as well as their perceptions of the impact of COVID-19 on their cancer health care services. A survey was sent to 5800 patients at a cancer center in Toronto, Canada. Descriptive results were summarized. Qualitative feedback was coded and summarized. To examine for potential associations, regression models were tested for the outcomes of patient psychological well-being, knowledge, attitudes, and practices, and they accounted for several demographic, health literacy, and disease variables.A total of 1631 surveys were completed. Most patients saw their appointments shifted to virtual visits, and for a substantial minority, there was no change. A majority of the patients (62%) expressed fears about contracting the virus. There were no independent predictors of COVID-19-related knowledge. Fears were more pronounced among patients who did not speak English and those who used social media more often. Female participants, those who scored higher on knowledge questions, and those who used cancer center materials were more likely to take preventative measures against infection.This study provides a snapshot of the state of cancer patient treatment and the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of patients between the first 2 waves of the pandemic. The study's results can inform our understanding of adaptation to conditions during and after the outbreak."

    "content": "Previous studies have described suicidal ideation among survivors of childhood cancer, but small numbers of events limit the understanding of suicide risk. The objectives of this study were to assess whether childhood cancer survivors are at increased risk of suicide in comparison with the general population and to determine risk factors associated with risk in a population-based cohort.First primary malignancies among individuals aged 0 to 19 years from 1975 to 2016 were identified from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) databases. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) of suicide were obtained via SEER*Stat software from SEER 9. Fine and Gray proportional hazards models were used to identify suicide-associated factors among childhood cancer patients included in SEER 18.In all, 96,948 childhood cancer cases and 89 suicides were identified. Across all attained ages, the suicide risk for individuals with a childhood cancer history (11.64 per 100,000 person-years) was similar to the risk for those without a cancer history (SMR, 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91-1.43). However, for survivors alive beyond the age of 28 years (the median age of death by suicide), the suicide risk was significantly elevated (suicides per 100,000 person-years, 22.43; SMR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.02-1.87). Females (hazard ratio, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.18-0.59; P < .01) had lower risks than males.These results suggest that long-term childhood cancer survivors may be at increased suicide risk. Male sex is an independent risk factor for suicide. However, the absolute risk of suicide in older survivors is still low at ~1 per 5000 person-years. Future efforts should identify survivorship strategies to mitigate suicide risk."

    "content": "Adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors have high risks of late effects. Little is known about the late-effect information needs of AYAs early in treatment or their role in treatment decision making. This study evaluated the importance, quality, and implications of information about late effects in AYAs recently diagnosed with cancer.This study surveyed 201 AYAs with cancer who were 15 to 29\u00a0years old and were treated at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (Boston, Massachusetts). Patients were approached within 6\u00a0weeks of their diagnosis and were asked about their late-effect and infertility information needs, treatment decision making, and communication outcomes.Forty-five percent of the participants were female; 88% were white. Most AYAs (87% [173 of 200]) considered information about the risks of late effects to be extremely or very important; 80% (159 of 200) valued information about infertility. Many were distressed by information about late effects (53% [105 of 200]) and infertility (45% [89 of 200]); those who considered late-effect information distressing were more likely to value this information (P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). Consideration of late effects (41% [82 of 201]) and infertility (36% [72 of 201]) greatly influenced many patients' treatment decision making. Although 92% of the patients (184 of 199) reported receiving high-quality information about the diagnosis, 57% (113 of 199; P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001) and 65% (130 of 199; P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001) felt that they had received high-quality information about late effects and infertility, respectively.Most AYAs with cancer value early information about the risks of late effects and infertility, yet many patients felt that they had not received high-quality information about these topics. The development of age-appropriate late-effect communication strategies that recognize high AYA distress may help to address the gap between desired information and perceived information quality."

In this study, a population-based data set of patients diagnosed with cancer and enrolled in Medicaid was created and evaluated. The objective was to compare the characteristics of patients with cancer identified in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data and linked to the Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) Personal Summary files with the characteristics of patients who were not linked to the MAX file.All persons in 14 SEER registries diagnosed with cancer from 2006 to 2013 who were or were not linked to the 2006-2013 nationwide MAX files were selected, and patient demographic characteristics were compared for 3 age groups. Common cancer sites and the timing of Medicaid enrollment with respect to patients' cancer diagnoses were reported, and the stage at diagnosis and 4-year mortality were compared by 3 categories of Medicaid enrollment.Approximately 18% of the sample was enrolled in Medicaid within 25 months of diagnosis. Enrollees had a greater proportion of racial/ethnic minorities in comparison with patients who were not enrolled. A late-stage diagnosis was more common among Medicaid patients and particularly among those who enrolled after their diagnosis. For every common cancer site, mortality was highest in the sample of Medicaid patients who enrolled after their diagnosis.The Medicaid enrollment data newly added to SEER records enhance researchers' ability to investigate research questions related to Medicaid policies and care delivery. For patients enrolled before their diagnosis, Medicaid appears to offer protection against late-stage disease and mortality."

However, whether these patients are at high risk for neoplasms other than lung cancer and mesothelioma remains inconclusive.To examine whether patients with pneumoconiosis have a higher incidence of malignant neoplasms other than lung cancer.We conducted a cohort study using the medical records of patients with pneumoconiosis who visited our two hospitals from 1 January 1991 through 31 December 2017. We identified the occurrence of malignant neoplasms and calculated the incidences and standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) compared with those of the general population.One hundred and seventy patients with pneumoconiosis (163 men, 7 women) including 142 patients with silicosis, 24 with asbestosis and 4 with pneumoconiosis were identified. The mean age was 66.8 years. The proportion of smokers was 79%. Forty-seven malignant neoplasms occurred. Most malignant neoplasms were lung cancer (n = 22), while some were digestive cancers such as gastric cancer (n = 9), oesophageal cancer (n = 3) and colorectal cancer (n = 3). Participants presented increased risks for lung cancer (SIR: 10.86, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.15-16.49), gastric cancer (SIR: 2.55, 95% CI: 1.22-5.35) and oesophageal cancer (SIR: 5.78, 95% CI: 1.86-17.92).Compared with the general population, patients with pneumoconiosis had an increased risk of malignant neoplasms of the digestive system in addition to lung cancer. Clinicians should consider testing for digestive system cancers as well as for lung cancers in these patients."

Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to identify which factors were associated with COVID-19 mortality.Three hundred and six SARS-CoV-2-positive cancer patients were included. Seventy-one had mild/moderate and 29% had severe COVID-19. Seventy-two patients died of COVID-19 (24%), of whom 35 died <7 days. Male sex [hazard ratio (HR): 1.97 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.15-3.38)], Asian ethnicity [3.42 (1. 59-7.35)], haematological cancer [2.03 (1.16-3.56)] and a cancer diagnosis for >2-5 years [2.81 (1.41-5.59)] or \u22655 years were associated with an increased mortality. Age >60 years and raised C-reactive protein (CRP) were also associated with COVID-19 death. Haematological cancer, a longer-established cancer diagnosis, dyspnoea at diagnosis and raised CRP were indicative of early COVID-19-related death in cancer patients (<7 days from diagnosis).Findings further substantiate evidence for increased risk of COVID-19 mortality for male and Asian cancer patients, and those with haematological malignancies or a cancer diagnosis >2 years. These factors should be accounted for when making clinical decisions for cancer patients."

We analysed the odds of advanced stage of cancer as a flexible function of the length of primary care interval (days from first presentation to referral) and secondary care interval (days from referral to diagnosis), respectively, using logistic regression with restricted cubic splines.The association between time intervals and stage was similar for each type of cancer. A statistically significant U-shaped association was seen between the secondary care interval and the diagnosis of advanced rather than localised cancer, odds decreasing from the first day onwards and increasing around three and a half months. A different pattern was seen for the primary care interval, flat trends for colorectal and lung cancers and a slightly curved association for ovarian cancer, although not statistically significant.The results confirm previous findings that some cancers may progress even within the relatively short time frame of regulated diagnostic intervals. The study supports the current emphasis on expediting symptomatic diagnosis of cancer."

    "content": "The enrollment of Black patients in cancer clinical trials continues to trend far below the true prevalence of disease in Black patients in the United States, limiting the generalizability of trial results. A potentially overlooked contributor to the underenrollment of Black patients may be the increasing enrollment of cancer trials in countries outside the United States. However, the impact of the globalization of cancer clinical trials on recruitment of racial minority patients has been understudied.In this study, race and accrual location data for all cancer drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 2015 and 2018 were analyzed. A disparity score was calculated for each approval, a metric comparing Black enrollment in clinical trials with the estimated burden of disease in Black patients.Of 49 global clinical trials supporting 35 FDA drug approvals with race data available, Black patients accounted for 2.5% of enrollment (range, 0%-10%), with a median disparity score of 0.19 (range, 0.01-0.98). In 21 clinical trials supporting 18 FDA drug approvals with both race and accrual location data available, 64% patients were enrolled outside the United States (range, 0%-100%). Black patients accounted for 3.2% of enrollment (range, 0.2%-10%), and the median disparity score was 0.23 (range, 0.01-0.98). There was a significant inverse correlation between the proportion of trial patients enrolled outside the United States and the disparity score (Pearson correlation, -0.61; P = .007).The globalization of cancer clinical trials is associated with a widening racial enrollment disparity gap in the United States. The impact of global trials on domestic clinical trial generalizability warrants further consideration from a regulatory and policy standpoint.Black patients continue to be underrepresented in cancer clinical trials; this disparity has worsened in recent years perhaps because of the globalization of cancer clinical trials. In an analysis of demographic information from 21 cancer clinical trials leading to US Food and Drug Administration approvals between 2015 and 2018, clinical trials conducted primarily outside the United States were 2-fold less likely to enroll Black participants than US clinical trials. Thus, the globalization of cancer clinical trials may have the unintended consequence of further exacerbating existing racial disparities in cancer clinical trial representation and ultimately the generalizability of trial results."

Associations with cancer mortality are not well studied, and whether associations are similar across race is unknown.We conducted a prospective analysis of 12 997 cancer-free participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study who were never users at visit 1 (1987-1989). Ever use, duration of use, and age at first use were modeled as time-dependent variables using Cox regression to estimate associations with total, obesity- and smoking-associated, bladder, breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer incidence and mortality.We ascertained 3869 cancer cases and 1661 cancer deaths in 237 999 or more person-years. At 6 years of follow-up, 70.8% of lipid-lowering drug use was a statin. Compared with never use, ever use was associated with lower total, obesity- and smoking-associated cancer mortality and with colorectal cancer mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.32 to 0.79) and incidence (HR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.53 to 0.92). Inverse associations were consistent by sex and race. Shorter-term use was associated with bladder cancer incidence in men (<10 years: HR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.02 to 2.73). First use at age 60 years or older was inversely associated with: total mortality, obesity- and smoking-associated mortality, and colorectal cancer mortality; and total incidence, obesity- and smoking-associated incidence, and breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer incidence.This study provides additional evidence for inverse associations between lipid-lowering drug use and cancer incidence and mortality but a positive association with bladder cancer incidence in men. Evaluation of the impact of chemoprevention strategies that include lipid-lowering drugs on population-level cancer burden is needed."

To ensure timely detection of new cancer events, knowledge is warranted on the timing of cancer recurrence (CR) and second primary cancer (SPC), including risk factors for CR.This population-based register study included 67,092 patients diagnosed with malignant melanoma, bladder, lung, ovarian, endometrial, colorectal and breast cancer in Denmark in 2008-2016. The time from primary cancer to CR or SPC and risk factors for prolonged time to CR were analysed and stratified on sex and primary cancer type.Cancer recurrence proportions ranged from 6% to 35%. The risk of CR increased profoundly within the first 3\u00a0years and then levelled off, except for breast cancer. A total of 3%-6% of patients had SPC, with monotonously increasing cumulative incidence proportions. Besides primary tumour characteristics, lower educational level, living alone and comorbidity were associated with earlier CR. For example, in female malignant melanoma, HRs and 95% confidence intervals were 0.47 (0.37-0.61) for high educational level, 1.40 (1.16-1.68) for living alone and 2.38 (1.53-3.70) for high comorbidity.The results may inform stratified risk assessment in decision of frequency, location and duration of post-cancer follow-up care."

Polytomous logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to evaluate the association between HIV, cancer stage, and stage-adjusted mortality after diagnosis, respectively. Regression models accounted for the type of health facility at which cancer treatment was administered and the type of individual health insurance.HIV-infected patients with cancer were found to be more likely to be uninsured (HIV-infected: 5.0% vs HIV-uninfected: 3.3%; P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001) and were less likely to have private health insurance (25.4% vs 44.7%; P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). Compared with those not infected with HIV, the odds of being diagnosed at an advanced stage of disease were significantly elevated in PLWH for melanoma and cancers of the oral cavity, liver, female breast, prostate, and thyroid (odds ratio for stage IV vs stage I range, 1.24-2.06). PLWH who were diagnosed with stage I to stage III disease experienced elevated mortality after diagnosis across 13 of the 14 cancer sites evaluated, with hazard ratios ranging from 1.20 (95% CI, 1.14-1.26) for lung cancer to 1.85 (95% CI, 1.68-2.04), 1.85 (95% CI, 1.51-2.27), and 2.93 (95% CI, 2.08-4.13), respectively, for cancers of the female breast, cervix, and thyroid.PLWH were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced-stage cancers and to experience elevated mortality after a cancer diagnosis, even after accounting for health care-related factors."

    "title": "The efficacy and cost-effectiveness of patient navigation programs across the cancer continuum: A systematic review.",
    "content": "Published studies regarding patient navigation (PN) and cancer were reviewed to assess quality, determine gaps, and identify avenues for future research. The PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched for studies investigating the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of PN across the cancer continuum. Each included article was scored independently by 2 separate reviewers with the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. The current review identified 113 published articles that assessed PN and cancer care, between August 1, 2010, and February 1, 2018, 14 of which reported on the cost-effectiveness of PN programs. Most publications focused on the effectiveness of PN in screening (50%) and diagnosis (27%) along the continuum of cancer care. Many described the effectiveness of PN for breast cancer (52%) or colorectal cancer outcomes (51%). Most studies reported favorable outcomes for PN programs, including increased uptake of and adherence to cancer screenings, timely diagnostic resolution and follow-up, higher completion rates for cancer therapy, and higher rates of attending medical appointments. Cost-effectiveness studies showed that PN programs yielded financial benefits. Quality assessment showed that 75 of the 113 included articles (65%) had 2 or more weak components. In conclusion, this review indicates numerous gaps within the PN and cancer literature where improvement is needed. For example, more research is needed at other points along the continuum of cancer care outside of screening and diagnosis. In addition, future research into the effectiveness of PN for understudied cancers outside of breast and colorectal cancer is necessary along with an assessment of cost-effectiveness and more rigorous reporting of study designs and results in published articles."

    "title": "Patterns and predictors of cancer-related fatigue in ovarian and endometrial cancers: 1-year longitudinal study.",
    "content": "Fatigue is a common and distressing symptom for patients with gynecologic cancers. Few studies have empirically examined whether it spontaneously resolves. This study was aimed at identifying longitudinal patterns of fatigue and predictors of clinically significant fatigue 1\u00a0year after treatment completion.This was a prospective cohort study of women with newly diagnosed ovarian (n\u00a0=\u00a081) or endometrial cancer (n\u00a0=\u00a0181) that did not progress or recur within 1\u00a0year of treatment completion. Symptoms of fatigue, depression, and anxiety were assessed after surgery and 6 and 12\u00a0months after treatment completion with the Fatigue Assessment Scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Patients' fatigue scores over time were classified (scores of 22-50, clinically significant; scores of 10-21, not clinically significant). Logistic regression models were fit to examine associations between fatigue and patient characteristics.Among 262 participants, 48% reported clinically significant fatigue after surgery. One year later, 39% reported fatigue. There were 6 patterns over time: always low (37%), always high (25%), high then resolves (18%), new onset (10%), fluctuating (6%), and incidental (5%). Patients with fatigue after surgery were more likely to report fatigue at 12\u00a0months in comparison with others (odds ratio [OR], 6.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.82-13.11; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Patients with depressive symptoms also had higher odds of fatigue (OR, 3.36; 95% CI, 1.08-10.65; P\u00a0=\u00a0.039), although only one-third of fatigued patients reported depressive symptoms.Nearly half of women with gynecologic cancers had clinically significant fatigue after surgery, whereas 44% and 39% had fatigue 6\u00a0months and 1\u00a0year later; this suggests that spontaneous regression of symptoms is relatively rare. Women who reported fatigue, depressive symptoms, or 2 or more medical comorbidities had higher odds of reporting fatigue 1\u00a0year later. Future studies should test scalable interventions to improve fatigue in women with gynecologic cancers."

    "content": "Patients with cancer history are usually excluded from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) clinical trials. However, whether previous malignancy affects the oncological outcomes of HCC patients has not been fully assessed. This study aimed to evaluate whether prior cancer compromised the survival of HCC patients.Patients with HCC were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database between 2004 and 2015, and then they were classified into groups with and without prior cancer. The Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression analysis were adopted to evaluate whether prior cancer impacted clinical outcomes after propensity score matching (PSM) adjusting baseline differences. Validation was performed in the cohort from our institution.We identified 2642 HCC patients with prior cancer. After PSM, the median overall survival (OS) time were 14.5 and 12.0\u2009months respectively for groups with and without prior cancer. Prior cancer did not compromise prognosis in patients with HCC (p\u2009=\u20090.49). The same tendency was found in subgroups stratified by tumor stages and cancer interval period: OS was similar between groups with and without prior cancer (both p values>\u20090.1). In the multivariate Cox regression model, prior cancer did not adversely impact patients' survival (HR: 1.024; 95% CI: 0.961-1.092). In the validation cohort from our institution, prior cancer had no significant association with worse outcomes (p\u2009=\u20090.48).For HCC patients, prior cancer did not compromise their survival, regardless of tumor stage and cancer interval period. Exclusion criteria for HCC clinical trials could be reconsidered."

    "content": "The American Cancer Society, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Cancer Institute, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries collaborate to provide annual updates on cancer occurrence and trends in the United States.Data on new cancer diagnoses during 2001 through 2016 were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-funded and National Cancer Institute-funded population-based cancer registry programs and compiled by the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Data on cancer deaths during 2001 through 2017 were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics' National Vital Statistics System. Trends in incidence and death rates for all cancers combined and for the leading cancer types by sex, racial/ethnic group, and age were estimated by joinpoint analysis and characterized by the average annual percent change during the most recent 5\u00a0years (2012-2016 for incidence and 2013-2017 for mortality).Overall, cancer incidence rates decreased 0.6% on average per year during 2012 through 2016, but trends differed by sex, racial/ethnic group, and cancer type. Among males, cancer incidence rates were stable overall and among non-Hispanic white males but decreased in other racial/ethnic groups; rates increased for 5 of the 17 most common cancers, were stable for 7 cancers (including prostate), and decreased for 5 cancers (including lung and bronchus [lung] and colorectal). Among females, cancer incidence rates increased during 2012 to 2016 in all racial/ethnic groups, increasing on average 0.2% per year; rates increased for 8 of the 18 most common cancers (including breast), were stable for 6 cancers (including colorectal), and decreased for 4 cancers (including lung). Overall, cancer death rates decreased 1.5% on average per year during 2013 to 2017, decreasing 1.8% per year among males and 1.4% per year among females. During 2013 to 2017, cancer death rates decreased for all cancers combined among both males and females in each racial/ethnic group, for 11 of the 19 most common cancers among males (including lung and colorectal), and for 14 of the 20 most common cancers among females (including lung, colorectal, and breast). The largest declines in death rates were observed for melanoma of the skin (decreasing 6.1% per year among males and 6.3% among females) and lung (decreasing 4.8% per year among males and 3.7% among females). Among children younger than 15\u00a0years, cancer incidence rates increased an average of 0.8% per year during 2012 to 2016, and cancer death rates decreased an average of 1.4% per year during 2013 to 2017. Among adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 39\u00a0years, cancer incidence rates increased an average of 0.9% per year during 2012 to 2016, and cancer death rates decreased an average of 1.0% per year during 2013 to 2017.Although overall cancer death rates continue to decline, incidence rates are leveling off among males and are increasing slightly among females. These trends reflect population changes in cancer risk factors, screening test use, diagnostic practices, and treatment advances. Many cancers can be prevented or treated effectively if they are found early. Population-based cancer incidence and mortality data can be used to inform efforts to decrease the cancer burden in the United States and regularly monitor progress toward goals."

    "title": "Exemptions to state laws regulating opioid prescribing for patients with cancer-related pain: A summary.",
    "content": "Cancer-related pain is highly prevalent and is commonly treated with prescription opioids. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now encourages conservative opioid prescribing in recognition of potential opioid-related risks. However, CDC guidelines have been misapplied to patients with cancer. Recent laws at the state level reflect the CDC's guidance by limiting opioid prescribing. It is unclear whether states exempt cancer-related pain, which may affect cancer pain management. Thus, the objective of this study was to summarize current state-level opioid prescribing laws and exemptions for patients with cancer.Two study authors reviewed publicly available state records to identify the most recent opioid prescribing laws and cancer-related exemptions. Documents were required to have the force of law and be enacted at the time of the search (November 2020).Results indicated that 36 states had enacted formal legislation limiting the duration and/or dosage of opioid prescriptions, and this was largely focused on acute pain and/or initial prescriptions. Of these states, 32 (89%) explicitly exempted patients with cancer-related pain from opioid prescribing laws. Exemptions were broadly applied, with few states providing specific guidance for cancer-related pain prescribing.The results of this study indicate that most states recognize the importance of prescription opioids in cancer-related pain management. However, drafting nuanced and clinically relevant opioid legislation is challenging for a heterogenous population. Additionally, current attempts to regulate opioid prescribing by state law may unintentionally undermine patient-centered approaches to pain management. Additional resources are needed to facilitate clarity at the intersection of opioid-related legislation and clinical management for cancer-related pain.In this review of state-level legislation, current limitations on opioid prescribing are summarized and detailed information is provided on exemptions for patients with cancer. The majority of states have enacted specific dosage and/or duration limitations on opioid prescribing while including broad exemptions for cancer-related pain. Cancer-related pain exemptions are important to include, as is consistent with national and professional guidelines (eg, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). However, these exemptions may also unintentionally undermine patient-centered approaches to pain management. Additional resources, including specific guidance for patients with cancer, are needed to facilitate clarity at the intersection of opioid-related legislation and clinical pain management. \u200b."

    "content": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b32 gene Pro12Ala allele polymorphism (<i>PPARG2</i> Pro12Ala; rs1801282) has been linked to both cancer risk and dietary factors. We conducted the first systematic literature review of studies published before December 2020 using the PubMed database to summarize the current evidence on whether dietary factors for cancer may differ by individuals carrying C (common) and/or G (minor) alleles of the <i>PPARG2</i> Pro12Ala allele polymorphism. The inclusion criteria were observational studies that investigated the association between food or nutrient consumption and risk of incident cancer stratified by <i>PPARG2</i> Pro12Ala allele polymorphism. From 3815 identified abstracts, nine articles (18,268 participants and 4780 cancer cases) covering three cancer sites (i.e., colon/rectum, prostate, and breast) were included. CG/GG allele carriers were more impacted by dietary factors than CC allele carriers. High levels of protective factors (e.g., carotenoids and prudent dietary patterns) were associated with a lower cancer risk, and high levels of risk factors (e.g., alcohol and refined grains) were associated with a higher cancer risk. In contrast, both CG/GG and CC allele carriers were similarly impacted by dietary fats, well-known PPAR-\u03b3 agonists. These findings highlight the complex relation between <i>PPARG2</i> Pro12Ala allele polymorphism, dietary factors, and cancer risk, which warrant further investigation."

    "content": "Cancer patients often prefer to die at home, a location associated with better quality of death (QoD). Several studies demonstrate disparities in end-of-life care among immigrant populations in the United States. This study aimed to evaluate how immigrant status affects location and quality of death among patients with advanced cancer in the United States.Data were derived from Coping with Cancer, a federally funded multi-site prospective study of advanced cancer patients and caregivers. The sample of patients who died during the study period was weighted (N<sub>w</sub> \u00a0=\u00a0308) to reduce statistically significant differences between immigrant (N<sub>w</sub> \u00a0=\u00a049) and nonimmigrant (N<sub>w</sub> \u00a0=\u00a0259) study participants. Primary outcomes were location of death, death at preferred location, and poor QoD.Analyses adjusted for covariates indicated that patients who were immigrants were more likely to die in a hospital than home (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 3.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.65-6.71) and less likely to die where they preferred (AOR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.20-0.90). Furthermore, immigrants were more likely to have poor QoD (AOR, 5.47; 95% CI, 2.70-11.08).Immigrants, as compared to nonimmigrants, are more likely to die in hospital settings, less likely to die at their preferred location, and more likely to have poor QoD.Cancer patients typically prefer to die in their own homes, which is associated with improved quality of death. However, disparities in end-of-life care among immigrant populations in the United States remain significant. Our study found that immigrants are less likely to die in their preferred locations and more likely to die in hospital settings, resulting in poorer quality of death."

    "content": "To reduce out-of-pocket costs, the Korean government expanded health insurance reimbursement in anti-cancer drugs for cancer patients in 2013. Our objective was to examine the impact of the benefit coverage expansion policy on healthcare utilization and overall survival (OS) among patients with six types of solid cancer after the policy of expanding health insurance coverage.This study analyzed a before-and-after retrospective cohort of patients newly diagnosed with six types of solid cancer (stomach cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer) from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2015 in Korea. The intervention was the expansion of reimbursement in 2013. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the policy effect.In total, 142,579 before and 147,760 patients after the benefit expansion, and after matched by age, gender, and stage, 132,440 before and 132,440 patients after policy were included in the analysis. Almost total medical expenditure increased for five types of cancer increased. The expansion of health insurance reimbursement was associated with significantly lower overall mortality compared with pre-policy mortality for all six cancer sites.The policy of expanding health insurance reimbursement might have been associated with a significant increase in survival among cancer patients by ensuring access to health care and medicine. Although the reimbursement expansion timing differs for each cancer, it is believed that eliminating delayed treatment might rather lead to reduce medical expenses and improve health outcomes."

    "content": "Diagnosis of esophageal cancer or precursor lesions by endoscopic imaging depends on endoscopist expertise and is inevitably subject to interobserver variability. Studies on computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) using deep learning or machine learning are on the increase. However, studies with small sample sizes are limited by inadequate statistical strength. Here, we used a meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) of CAD algorithms of esophageal cancers or neoplasms using endoscopic images.Core databases were searched for studies based on endoscopic imaging using CAD algorithms for the diagnosis of esophageal cancer or neoplasms and presenting data on diagnostic performance, and a systematic review and DTA meta-analysis were performed.Overall, 21 and 19 studies were included in the systematic review and DTA meta-analysis, respectively. The pooled area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio of CAD algorithms for the diagnosis of esophageal cancer or neoplasms in the image-based analysis were 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95-0.99), 0.94 (95% CI, 0.89-0.96), 0.88 (95% CI, 0.76-0.94), and 108 (95% CI, 43-273), respectively. Meta-regression showed no heterogeneity, and no publication bias was detected. The pooled area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio of CAD algorithms for the diagnosis of esophageal cancer invasion depth were 0.96 (95% CI, 0.86-0.99), 0.90 (95% CI, 0.88-0.92), 0.88 (95% CI, 0.83-0.91), and 138 (95% CI, 12-1569), respectively.CAD algorithms showed high accuracy for the automatic endoscopic diagnosis of esophageal cancer and neoplasms. The limitation of a lack in performance in external validation and clinical applications should be overcome."

    "content": "Research on cannabis use among those with a history of cancer is limited.Prevalence of past-year cannabis use among individuals with and without a cancer history and predictors of use within these 2 groups were determined using data from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health study, a nationally representative, longitudinal survey conducted in the United States (waves 1-4; 2013-2018). Discrete time survival analyses were used to estimate baseline (wave 1) predictors (physical health status, mental health status, pain, and demographic variables) on past-year engagement with cannabis within individuals who reported a cancer diagnosis at wave 1 (n = 1022) and individuals who reported never having cancer at any wave (n = 19,702).At the most recent survey, 8% of cancer survivors reported past-year cannabis use, compared with 15% of those without a cancer history. Across 4 time points, an estimated 3.8% of cancer survivors engaged with cannabis, as compared to 6.5% of those without a cancer history. Across both groups, older age and having health insurance were associated with lower likelihood of engaging in cannabis use, whereas greater levels of pain were associated with higher likelihood of engaging in cannabis use. Among those without a cancer history, being female, White, and having better mental health status were associated with lower likelihood of engaging in cannabis use.Although cannabis use prevalence is lower among cancer survivors, the reasons for use are not markedly different from those without a cancer history. Continued monitoring of use, reasons for use, and harms or benefits is warranted.Results from this study, which uses data from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study, indicate that cannabis use is generally increasing across cancer survivors and those without a history of cancer. Cancer survivors are using cannabis at slightly lower rates than those without a history of cancer. Factors related to pain seem to be more prevalent in cancer populations relative to the general population, and could be contributing to cannabis use within cancer survivor populations."

    "content": "Hereditary pancreatic cancer, which includes patients with familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) and hereditary pancreatic cancer syndromes, accounts for about 10% of all pancreatic cancer diagnoses. The early detection of pre-cancerous pancreatic cysts has increasingly become a focus of interest in recent years as a potential avenue to lower pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality. Intraductal papillary mucinous cystic neoplasms (IPMNs) are recognized precursor lesions of pancreatic cancer. IPMNs have high prevalence in patients with hereditary pancreatic cancer and their relatives. While various somatic mutations have been identified in IPMNs, certain germline mutations associated with hereditary cancer syndromes have also been identified in IPMNs, suggesting a role in their formation. While the significance for the higher prevalence of IPMNs or similar germline mutations in these high-risk patients remain unclear, IPMNs do represent pre-malignant lesions that need close surveillance. This review summarizes the available literature on the incidence and prevalence of IPMNs in inherited genetic predisposition syndromes and FPC and speculates if IPMN and pancreatic cancer surveillance in these high-risk individuals needs to change."

Pathology reports could potentially identify cancer recurrences. Their utility to capture recurrences is unknown.This analysis assesses the sensitivity of pathology reports to identify patients with cancer recurrence and the stage at recurrence.The study includes patients with recurrent breast (n=214) or colorectal (n=203) cancers.This retrospective analysis included patients from a population-based cancer registry who were part of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research (PCOR) Study, a project that followed cancer patients in-depth for 5 years after diagnosis to identify recurrences.Information abstracted from pathology reports for patients with recurrence was compared with their PCOR data (gold standard) to determine what percent had a pathology report at the time of recurrence, the sensitivity of text in the report to identify recurrence, and if the stage at recurrence could be determined from the pathology report.One half of cancer patients had a pathology report near the time of recurrence. For patients with a pathology report, the report's sensitivity to identify recurrence was 98.1% for breast cancer cases and 95.7% for colorectal cancer cases. The specific stage at recurrence from the pathology report had a moderate agreement with gold-standard data.Pathology reports alone cannot measure population-based recurrence of solid cancers but can identify specific cohorts of recurrent cancer patients. As electronic submission of pathology reports increases, these reports may identify specific recurrent patients in near real-time."

Flexible parametric relative survival models were used to estimate the age-specific crude probability of dying from cancer and other causes by calendar year, sex and spread of disease for all solid tumours combined and cancers of the colorectum, lung, female breast, prostate and melanoma.Estimated 10-year sex, age and spread-specific crude probabilities of cancer death generally decreased over time for most cancer types, although the magnitude of the decrease varied. For example, out of 100 fifty-year old men with localized prostate cancer, 12 would have died from their cancer if diagnosed in 1985 and 3 in 2014. Greater degree of spread was consistently associated with higher probability of dying from cancer, although outcomes for lung cancer were consistently poor. For both males and females, the probability of non-cancer deaths was higher among older patients, those diagnosed with localized cancers and where cancer survival was higher.Crude probabilities presented here may be useful in helping clinicians and their patients better understand prognoses and make informed decisions about treatment. They also provide novel insights into the relative contributions that early detection and improved treatments have on the observed temporal patterns in cancer survival."

The objective was to assess COVID-19 mortality rates in patients with cancer versus patients without cancer and uncover possible statistically significant characteristics contributing to mortality.This retrospective study analyzed patients with cancer and patients without cancer who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from March 1 through April 30, 2020. This was a multicenter study in the state of Louisiana throughout the Ochsner Health System in both tertiary and nontertiary centers. Patients older than 18 years were eligible. Three hundred twelve patients with cancer were compared with 4833 patients without cancer.Mortality was found to be higher in the cancer group. Patients of advanced age with cancer had a significant increase in mortality (odds ratio [OR], 5.96; P < .001). Other significant risk factors for increased mortality were male sex (OR, 2.15), a history of chronic kidney disease (OR, 3.84), and obesity (OR, 1.30). In hospitalized patients with cancer, adverse vital signs on admission, decreased absolute lymphocyte counts, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, lactic acidosis, and elevated procalcitonin all seemed to increase the risk of death. Among patients with cancer, active or progressive disease (P < .001) and recent therapy (OR, 2.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-5.08) were shown to increase mortality.Patients with cancer have increased mortality in the setting of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with patients without cancer. Patients with cancer who are 65 years of age or older and those with certain comorbidities have the greatest risk of death. Recent cancer-directed therapy and disease status also seem to play roles in mortality.This is the largest study of patients with cancer versus patients without cancer to date and is the first multivariate analysis study comparing these 2 patient populations. This study confirms the hypothesis that patients with cancer are at increased risk for mortality and that there are multiple characteristics posing the potential to risk-stratify these patients in the setting of a future outbreak."

The authors explored the mediating role of distress between medical care appraisal and BF and PTG and the possible moderation of time since diagnosis in this relationship.LTCS' medical care appraisals (\"no unresolved/untreated symptoms,\" \"satisfaction with cancer care,\" and \"satisfaction with care for other diseases\") were positively associated with BF. PTG was positively associated with \"no unresolved/untreated symptoms\" and negatively associated with \"satisfaction with care for other diseases.\" Cancer distress partially mediated the associations between appraisals of medical care and BF, between \"no unresolved/untreated symptoms\" and PTG and between \"satisfaction with care for other diseases\" and PTG; whereas it totally mediated the association between \"satisfaction with cancer care\" and PTG. Time was a significant moderator in the model; the negative indirect effect of cognitive appraisal on BF and PTG through cancer distress weakened with longer time since diagnosis.Cancer survivors' medical care appraisal is associated with their perceptions of BF and PTG through distress. Therefore, distress screening could be part of the regular workup to identify distressed cancer survivors who are not satisfied with medical care; these survivors may benefit from interventions to reduce distress and increase BF and PTG."

    "content": "Despite recommendations for reflex immunohistochemistry (IHC) for mismatch repair (MMR) proteins to identify Lynch syndrome (LS), the uptake of genetic assessment by those who meet referral criteria is low. The authors implemented a comprehensive genetic navigation program to increase the uptake of genetic testing for LS in patients with endometrial cancer (EC) or nonserous/nonmucinous ovarian cancer (OC).Participants with newly diagnosed EC or OC were prospectively recruited from 3 cancer centers in Ontario, Canada. Family history questionnaires were used to assess LS-specific family history. Reflex IHC for MMR proteins was performed with the inclusion of clinical directives in pathology reports. A trained genetic navigator initiated a genetic referral on behalf of the treating physician and facilitated genetic referrals to the closest genetics center.A total of 841 participants (642 with EC, 172 with OC, and 27 with synchronous EC/OC) consented to the study; 194 (23%) were MMR-deficient by IHC. Overall, 170 women (20%) were eligible for a genetic assessment for LS: 35 on the basis of their family history alone, 24 on the basis of their family history and IHC, 82 on the basis of IHC alone, and 29 on the basis of clinical discretion. After adjustments for participants who died (n = 6), 149 of 164 patients (91%) completed a genetic assessment, and 111 were offered and completed genetic testing. Thirty-four women (4.0% of the total cohort and 30.6% of those with genetic testing) were diagnosed with LS: 5 with mutL homolog 1 (MLH1), 9 with mutS homolog 2 (MSH2), 15 with mutS homolog 6 (MSH6), and 5 with PMS2.The introduction of a navigated genetic program resulted in a high rate of genetic assessment (>90%) in patients with gynecologic cancer at risk for LS."

    "content": "Cancer outcomes for Medicaid enrollees may be affected by patients' primary care (PC) utilization and complex Medicaid enrollment dynamics, which have recently changed for many states under the Affordable Care Act.With New Jersey State Cancer Registry and linked Medicaid claims data, a retrospective cohort study was conducted for patients with incident breast, colorectal, or invasive cervical cancer (aged 21-64 years) diagnosed in 2012-2014. Associations of Medicaid enrollment factors and PC utilization with the stage at diagnosis and treatment delays were examined with multivariate logistic regression models.The study included 19,209 total cancer cases and 3253 linked Medicaid cases. Medicaid cases were more likely to be diagnosed at a late stage and to experience treatment delays in comparison with non-Medicaid cases. In adjusted analyses, Medicaid cases with 1 or more PC visits before the diagnosis had lower odds of a late-stage diagnosis (odds ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.67) in comparison with Medicaid cases with no outpatient visits. New enrollees (<6 months) and longer term enrollees in fee-for-service (FFS) Medicaid had greater odds of a late-stage diagnosis and treatment delays in comparison with those in Medicaid managed care.Medicaid patients with cancer diagnosed just before and in the initial year of eligibility expansion had worse outcomes than non-Medicaid cases. Poor outcomes were especially pronounced among new enrollees, those without outpatient visits before their diagnosis, and FFS enrollees. Targeted strategies to enhance care continuity, including access to PC providers before the diagnosis and a better understanding of pathways to cancer care upon Medicaid enrollment, are needed to improve outcomes in this population."

    "content": "Emergency department (ED) utilization and emergency admissions by patients with cancer have increased. The authors aimed to evaluate the characteristics of patients with cancer admitted through the ED and determine whether cancer types are related to in-hospital mortality.The National Emergency Department Information System database of patients visiting EDs in South Korea between 2016 and 2017 was analyzed. Among 6,179,088 adult patients who presented to an ED with nontraumatic medical illness, patients with cancer were identified. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality.Patients with cancer accounted for 6.8% of ED visits, and 239,630 patients (57.0%) were admitted to the hospital (intensive care unit [ICU], 9.5%; others, 90.5%). The prevalent cancers requiring hospitalization were lung cancer (15.7%), liver cancer (14.2%), and colon cancer (11.6%). The commonest reasons for admission other than cancer-related medical problems (41.4%) were pneumonia (4.8%) and hepatobiliary infection (2.8%). Overall in-hospital mortality was 16.1% (ICU, 28.3%; general wards, 14.8%); lung cancer (22.9%), liver cancer (19.7%), and leukemia/multiple myeloma (17.8%) showed the highest mortality rates. The highest odds for mortality were for lung cancer (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.227; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.124-2.335; P < .001) and liver cancer (adjusted OR, 1.839; 95% CI, 1.751-1.930; P < .001), which were referenced to genitourinary cancer by multivariable logistic regression analysis.More than half of the patients with cancer visiting EDs were admitted to the hospital with a mortality rate of 16.1%. Physicians treating patients with cancer and policymakers and planners designing health systems should understand the different prevalences and outcomes of oncological emergencies by cancer type to improve patient care."

    "content": "Patients with cancer have a higher risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) than noncancer patients. The authors conducted a multicenter retrospective study to investigate the clinical manifestations and outcomes of patients with cancer who are diagnosed with COVID-19.The authors reviewed the medical records of hospitalized patients who were treated at 5 hospitals in Wuhan City, China, between January 5 and March 18, 2020. Clinical parameters relating to cancer history (type and treatment) and COVID-19 were collected. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Secondary analyses were the association between clinical factors and severe COVID-19 and OS.A total of 107 patients with cancer were diagnosed with COVID-19, with a median age of 66\u00a0years (range, 37-98\u00a0years). Lung (21 patients; 19.6%), gastrointestinal (20 patients; 18.7%), and genitourinary (20 patients; 18.7%) cancers were the most common cancer diagnoses. A total of 37 patients (34.6%) were receiving active anticancer treatment when diagnosed with COVID-19, whereas 70 patients (65.4%) were on follow-up. Overall, 52.3% of patients (56 patients) developed severe COVID-19; this rate was found to be higher among patients receiving anticancer treatment than those on follow-up (64.9% vs 45.7%), which corresponded to an inferior OS in the former subgroup of patients (hazard ratio, 3.365; 95% CI, 1.455-7.782 [P\u00a0=\u00a0.005]). The detrimental effect of anticancer treatment on OS was found to be independent of exposure to systemic therapy (case fatality rate of 33.3% [systemic therapy] vs 43.8% [nonsystemic therapy]).The results of the current study demonstrated that >50.0% of infected patients with cancer are susceptible to severe COVID-19. This risk is aggravated by simultaneous anticancer treatment and portends for a worse survival, despite treatment for COVID-19."

    "title": "Second malignant neoplasms after childhood cancer: A nationwide population-based study in Korea.",
    "content": "Second malignant neoplasm is one of the most devastating late effects of childhood cancers. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence and survival outcomes of patients developing second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) after surviving childhood cancer in Korea.Medical data of childhood cancer patients diagnosed between 1993 and 2012 were obtained from the Korea Central Cancer Registry. The risk of developing SMNs was calculated using standardized incidence ratio (SIR), excess absolute risk (EAR), and cumulative risk. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were estimated, stratified by SMN status.A total of 28,405 childhood cancer patients were diagnosed in the study period, and 337 (1.2%) developed SMN. The total follow-up period was 197,359 person-years at risk (PYR), with a median follow-up duration of 5.6 years. Overall SIR was 20.0, which was 23.2 in women, and 17.6 in men. The overall EAR was 16.4 per 10,000 PYR. The most common types of SMNs, in order of incidence, were other malignant epithelial neoplasms, leukemia, and soft tissue sarcomas. The cumulative incidence of developing SMNs was 0.7% at 5 years, 1.2% at 10 years, and 2% at 15 years. After primary cancer diagnosis, the 10-year overall survival rate of patients with SMNs was 65.1%, which was lower than the 73.4% in patients without SMN. After SMN diagnosis, the 10-year overall survival rate was 55.8%.Through this registry-based study of 5.6 years of follow up, childhood cancer survivors were found to be at 20-fold higher risk of developing a malignant neoplasm compared to the general population. The majority of malignant neoplasms are malignant epithelial neoplasms, leukemia, and soft tissue sarcomas. Continued surveillance for assessing long-term risks, and guidance for appropriate long-term follow up of childhood cancer survivors, are needed."

    "content": "Adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors experience psychological distress often because of cancer and its treatment. However, no prior studies have evaluated the additional medical expenditures and health care utilization associated with psychological distress in AYA cancer survivors.AYA cancer survivors and a comparison matched group of adults with no history of cancer were identified from 2011-2016 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data. Medical expenditures and health care utilization were evaluated with multivariable regression models.AYA cancer survivors were more likely to have psychological distress (11.5% of 1757) than adults with no history of cancer (5.8% of 5227). The prevalence of psychological distress was found to be high many years after the diagnosis, with 11.2% reporting distress \u226520 years after their cancer diagnosis. AYA cancer survivors with psychological distress were more likely to smoke and have chronic conditions and were less likely to exercise regularly in comparison with AYAs with no history of psychological distress. AYA cancer survivors with psychological distress had additional annual medical expenses ($4415; 95% CI, $993-$9690), office visits (2.80; 95% CI, 0.23-6.15), and use of prescription medications/medication renewals (11.58; 95% CI, 5.70-19.47) in comparison with AYA cancer survivors without psychological distress. Additional annual medical expenses of psychological distress were $2600 higher in AYA cancer survivors than adults without a history of cancer ($1802; 95% CI, $440-$3791).These results highlight the substantial economic burden associated with psychological distress in AYA cancer survivors. This research could inform survivorship care plans and interventions addressing the psychological needs of AYA cancer survivors."

    "title": "Association between vascular endothelial growth factor rs699947 polymorphism and the risk of three major urologic neoplasms (bladder cancer, prostate cancer, and renal cell carcinoma): A meta-analysis involving 11,204 subjects.",
    "content": "The relationship between vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene variant rs699947 polymorphism and urologic neoplasms risk was studied extensively in recent years. The VEGF gene plays a key role in angiogenesis of urologic neoplasms, but some conclusions are still inconclusive. The aim of this study was to determine whether this polymorphism is a risk factor for susceptibility to urologic neoplasms by conducting a meta-analysis.We performed a meta-analysis of 15 different publications from the PubMed, Embase and Medline databases, to better assess the association between VEGF rs699947 polymorphism and urologic neoplasms risk. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were evaluated using random or fixed effects models.By pooling all eligible studies, we found that the VEGF rs699947 polymorphism was not associated with overall urologic neoplasms. However, subgroup analysis based on cancer types demonstrated that significantly increased association was found between VEGF rs699947 polymorphism and the risk of bladder cancer (BCa) under heterozygous genetic model (OR\u202f=\u202f1.48, 95%CI\u202f=\u202f1.17-1.89). And rs699947 polymorphism was also identified an increased risk of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) under dominant, recessive, homozygous, heterozygous and allelic contrast genetic models, while no association was observed in prostate cancer (PCa). In addition, in subgroup analysis by ethnicity, we found rs699947 polymorphism was associated with Asian population under dominant, homozygous, heterozygous and allelic contrast genetic models. No evidence of publication bias was found (Begg's test, P\u202f=\u202f0.855; Egger's test, P\u202f=\u202f0.590).In summary, our study showed evidence that the VEGF rs699947 polymorphism was obviously associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer and renal cell carcinoma, particularly in Asian population, while no significant association was observed in overall urologic neoplasms. Future studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to further evaluate these associations in more details."

    "content": "Sub-Saharan African-born blacks (ABs) are one of the fastest-growing populations in the United States. However, to the authors' knowledge, data regarding the cancer burden in this group are lacking, which would inform targeted cancer prevention and control.The authors calculated age-standardized proportional incidence ratios (PIRs) comparing the frequency of the top 15 cancers in ABs with that of US-born non-Hispanic blacks (USBs) by sex and region of birth using incidence data for 2000 through 2012 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER 17) program.Compared with USBs, ABs had significantly higher PIRs of infection-related cancers (liver, stomach, and Kaposi sarcoma), blood cancers (leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma), prostate cancer, and thyroid cancers (females only). For example, the PIR for Kaposi sarcoma in AB versus USB women was 12.06 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 5.23-18.90). In contrast, ABs had lower PIRs for smoking-related and colorectal cancers (eg, for lung cancer among men, the PIR was 0.30 [95% CI, 0.27-0.34]). Furthermore, cancer occurrence in ABs versus USBs varied by region of birth. For example, the higher PIRs for liver cancer noted among male ABs (PIR, 3.57; 95% CI, 1.79-5.35) and for thyroid cancer in female ABs (PIR, 3.03; 95% CI, 2.03-4.02) were confined to Eastern African-born blacks, whereas the higher PIR for prostate cancer (PIR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.78, 2.02) was confined to Western African-born blacks.The cancer incidence profile of ABs is different from that of USBs and varies by region of birth, suggesting differences in environmental, cultural, social, and genetic factors. The findings of the current study could stimulate etiologic research and help to inform targeted interventions. Cancer 2017;123:3116-24. \u00a9 2017 American Cancer Society."

The objective of the current study was to perform a pan-cancer clinical and epigenetic molecular analysis of outcomes in African American (AA) and European American (EA) patients.Cross-platform analyses using cancer databases (the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program database and the National Cancer Data Base) and a molecular database (The Cancer Genome Ancestry Atlas) were performed to evaluate clinical and epigenetic molecular differences between AA and EA patients based on genetic ancestry.In the primary pan-cancer survival analysis using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2,045,839 patients; 87.5% EA and 12.5% AA), AA patients had higher mortality rates for 28 of 42 cancer types analyzed (hazard ratio, >1.0). AAs continued to have higher mortality in 13 cancer types after adjustment for socioeconomic variables using the National Cancer Database (5,150,023 patients; 11.6% AA and 88.4% EA). Then, molecular features of 5,283 tumors were analyzed in patients who had genetic ancestry data available (87.2% EA and 12.8% AA). Genes were identified with altered DNA methylation along with increased microRNA expression levels unique to AA patients that are associated with cancer drug resistance. Increased miRNAs (miR-15a, miR-17, miR-130-3p, miR-181a) were noted in common among AAs with breast, kidney, thyroid, or prostate carcinomas.The current results identified epigenetic features in AA patients who have cancer that may contribute to higher mortality rates compared with EA patients who have cancer. Therefore, a focus on molecular signatures unique to AAs may identify actionable molecular abnormalities."

    "content": "Medical financial burden includes material, behavioral, and psychological hardship and has been underinvestigated among adult survivors of childhood cancer.A survey from 698 survivors and 210 siblings from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study was analyzed. The intensity of financial hardship was estimated across 3 domains: 1) material, including conditions that arise from medical expenses; 2) behavioral, including coping behaviors to manage medical expenses; and 3) psychological hardship resulting from worries about medical expenses and insurance, as measured by the number of instances of each type of financial hardship (0, 1-2, and \u22653 instances). Multivariable logistic regressions were conducted to examine the clinical and sociodemographic predictors of experiencing financial hardship (0-2 vs \u22653 instances).The intensity of financial hardship did not significantly differ between survivors and siblings. Survivors reported more instances of material hardship than siblings (1-2 instances: 27.2% of survivors vs 22.6% of siblings; \u22653 instances: 15.9% of survivors vs 11.4% siblings; overall P = .03). In multivariable regressions, insurance was protective against all domains of financial hardship (behavioral odds ratio [OR], 0.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.06-0.22; material OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.19-0.71; psychological OR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.05-0.21). Survivors who were older at diagnosis, female, and with chronic health conditions generally had higher levels of hardship. Brain radiation and alkylating agents were associated with higher levels of hardship.Material, behavioral, and psychological financial burden among survivors of childhood cancer is common."

However, data on the relation of psychological distress to cancer screening is limited. The authors conducted a systematic review to assess psychological distress associated with cancer screening procedures.Studies that administered measures of psychological distress between 2 weeks before and 1 month after the screening procedure were included.In total, 22 eligible studies met criteria for review, including 13 observational trials and 9 randomized controlled trials. Eligible studies used a broad range of validated and unvalidated measures. Anxiety was the most commonly assessed construct and was measured using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory. Studies included breast, colorectal, prostate, lung, and cervical screening procedures. Distress was low across procedures, with the exception of colorectal screening. Distress did not vary according to the time at which distress was measured. None of the studies were conducted exclusively with the intention of assessing distress at the time of screening.Evidence of low distress during the time of cancer screening suggests that distress might not be a widespread barrier to screening among adults who undergo screening. However, more studies are needed using validated measures of distress to further understand the extent to which screening may elicit psychological distress and impede adherence to national screening recommendations.

The age-standardized incidence rate (ASR), annual percent change (APC), and relative survival were calculated.The ASR of total HNSCC decreased from 1999 to 2017 (APC, -0.2 [95% CI, -0.3 to -0.0]), as did the ASR of HPV-unrelated HNSCC (APC, -0.6 [95% CI, -0.8 to -0.5]); however, the ASR of HPV-related HNSCC increased (APC, 2.9 [95% CI, 2.5 to 3.2]). The rapidly increasing incidence of tonsil squamous cell carcinoma, which was the main subsite of HPV-related HNSCC, stabilized after 2011 (APC pre-2011, 6.8 [95% CI, 5.0 to 8.3]; APC post-2011, 1.6 [95% CI, -2.1 to 5.5]), and the difference was significant (P = .017). In contrast, oral cavity cancer incidence demonstrated the only increase among HPV-unrelated subsites, with the increase occurring after 2006 (APC pre-2006, 1.6 [95% CI, 0.3 to 2.8]; APC post-2006, 2.8 [95% CI, 2.2 to 3.5]); the main cause of this change was an increase in the ASR of tongue cancer.This study demonstrates the recent stabilization of tonsil cancer incidence and the contrasting increase in oral cavity cancer incidence, unlike other HPV-unrelated cancers. These trends require further surveillance and understanding in terms of tumor biology and prevention."

The authors investigated the incidence rates (IRs) of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, ischemic stroke, major bleeding, and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) according to the presence of cancer and cancer types.Overall, 399,344 (16.4%) had cancer, with the most common cancers being metastatic, prostatic, colorectal, lung, breast, and bladder. During a mean follow-up of 2.0 years, cancer increased all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 2.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.99-2.01). The IR of ischemic stroke was higher with pancreatic cancer (2.8%/y), uterine cancer (2.6%/y), and breast cancer (2.6%/y), whereas it was lower with liver/lung cancer (1.9%/y) and leukemia/myeloma (2.0%/y), in comparison with noncancer patients (2.4%/y). Cancer increased the risk of major bleeding (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.26-1.28) and ICH (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.05-1.10). Leukemia, liver cancer, myeloma, and metastatic cancers showed the highest IRs for major bleeding/ICH. Major bleeding and ICH rates progressively increased with the HAS-BLED score, which showed generally good predictivity with C indexes > 0.70 for all cancer types. The CHA<sub>2</sub> DS<sub>2</sub> -VASc score's predictivity was slightly lower in AF patients with cancer.Cancer increased all-cause mortality, major bleeding, and ICH risk in AF patients. The association between cancer and ischemic stroke differed among cancer types, and in some types, the risk of bleeding seemed to exceed the thromboembolic risk."

Patients had bone/joint cancers (SIR, 94.25; 95% CI, 50.71-137.80) and a remarkably high SIR for t-MN development. Patients receiving both CT and RT had the highest SIR (4.64; 95% CI, 4.08-5.20), followed by those receiving CT only (SIR, 3.30; 95% CI, 2.89-3.70). Contrarily, RT alone did not increase t-MN risk (SIR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.76-1.56). More exposure to leukemogenic agents resulted in the higher t-MNs development.The increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome after CT and/or RT was confirmed and subsets with substantially elevated risk for developing t-MNs were found. Such patients would be suitable for a prospective cohort for investigating t-MN pathogenesis by time series analyses."

The purpose of this article is to provide a nationally representative description of the sociodemographic characteristics of cancer survivors who have or had an informal caregiver in the United States.Cross-sectional data were taken from the Experiences With Cancer Survivorship Supplement of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey in 2011, 2016, and 2017. People were cancer survivors from diagnosis until the end of life. The study population consisted of adult survivors of cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer who were treated for cancer less than 3 years before the survey and were living in the community (n = 720). The main outcome measure was whether or not the cancer survivor reported having an informal caregiver.In the United States, 55.2% of cancer survivors reported having an informal caregiver during or after their cancer treatment. The relationship of the caregiver to the survivor varied by sex: males were more likely to have a spouse as their caregiver, and females were more likely to have a child as their caregiver. In multivariate analyses, cancer survivors who were female, were married, were of a race/ethnicity other than White, or were in poor health were more likely to have an informal caregiver.Future research can examine whether those without informal caregivers might need more formal support as they undergo cancer treatment and transition into cancer survivorship."

Multivariable modified Poisson regression models examined associations between CRW and treatment exposures, chronic health conditions, psychological symptoms, and health behaviors.Sixty-four percent of survivors (95% confidence interval [CI], 62.6-65.9) reported worry about subsequent malignancy, 45% (95% CI, 43.5-46.9) reported worry about physical problems related to cancer, and 33% (95% CI, 31.2-34.4) reported worry about relapse. Multiple psychological symptoms, treatment exposures, and chronic conditions significantly increased the risk of CRW. Survivors reporting CRW were at increased risk for substance use, inadequate physical activity, and increased health care utilization after adjustments for chronic conditions. For example, with adjustments for chronic conditions, those who endorsed CRW were more likely to have \u22655 cancer-related physician visits, \u22655 physician visits related to cancer, and \u22655 calls to a physician's office in the previous 2 years in comparison with survivors who were not worried. CRW was also associated with an increased risk of current tobacco use, past marijuana use, and current marijuana use.A substantial proportion of adult survivors of childhood cancer reported CRW associated with increased health care utilization. CRW may serve as an intervention target to promote well-being and adaptive health behaviors."

    "title": "The Survivorship Sleep Program (SSP): A synchronous, virtual cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia pilot program among cancer survivors.",
    "content": "For cancer survivors, insomnia is prevalent, distressing, and persists for years if unmanaged. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is an effective treatment yet can be difficult to access and may require modification to address survivorship-specific barriers to sleep. In this 2-phase study, the authors adapted and assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of synchronous, virtual CBT-I adapted for cancer survivors (the Survivorship Sleep Program [SSP]).From April to August 2020, cancer survivors with insomnia (N\u00a0=\u00a010) were interviewed to refine SSP content and delivery. From October 2020 to March 2021, 40 survivors were recruited for a randomized controlled trial comparing 4 weekly SSP sessions with enhanced usual care (EUC) (CBT-I referral plus a sleep hygiene handout). Feasibility and acceptability were assessed by enrollment, retention, attendance, fidelity, survey ratings, and exit interviews. Insomnia severity (secondary outcome), sleep quality, sleep diaries, and fatigue were assessed at baseline, postintervention, and at 1-month follow-up using linear mixed models.The SSP included targeted content and clinician-led, virtual delivery to enhance patient centeredness and access. Benchmarks were met for enrollment (56% enrolled/eligible), retention (SSP, 90%; EUC, 95%), attendance (100%), and fidelity (95%). Compared with EUC, the SSP resulted in large, clinically significant improvements in insomnia severity (Cohen d\u00a0=\u00a01.19) that were sustained at 1-month follow-up (Cohen d\u00a0=\u00a01.27). Improvements were observed for all other sleep metrics except sleep diary total sleep time and fatigue.Synchronous, virtually delivered CBT-I targeted to cancer survivors is feasible, acceptable, and seems to be efficacious for reducing insomnia severity. Further testing in larger and more diverse samples is warranted."

    "content": "Patients with chronic conditions are treated by many providers, which can increase the risk of communication gaps across providers and potential harm to patients. However, to the authors' knowledge, the extent of fragmented care among this population is unknown. In the current study, the authors sought to determine whether cancer survivors have more fragmented care than noncancer controls and to quantify the extent of fragmentation.Data from the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study linked to Medicare claims were used. The authors included beneficiaries with continuous Part A and B coverage for 12\u00a0months at the time of their baseline REGARDS survey. The primary outcome of the current study was claims-based fragmentation over 12\u00a0months, which was calculated using the reversed Bice-Boxerman Index so a higher score reflected greater fragmentation. Unadjusted differences in fragmentation were compared between cancer survivors and controls. Beta regression models were used to estimate associations between cancer status and fragmentation, adjusting for potential confounders.The authors included 4922 participants aged \u226565\u00a0years at baseline. Of these patients, approximately 21% were cancer survivors. Survivors had a median of 11 visits (interquartile range, 7-15 visits) with 5 providers compared with controls, who had a median of 9 visits (interquartile range, 6-14 visits) with 4 providers (P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). Cancer survivors had significantly more fragmented care compared with controls (median reversed Bice-Boxerman Index, 0.80 vs 0.76; P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). After adjusting for confounders, cancer survivors had an increased odds of having fragmented care (odds ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02-1.14).Care fragmentation is more prevalent among cancer survivors compared with those without a history of cancer. Future studies should examine whether fragmentation puts survivors at risk of worse outcomes."

There were 89 cases of bilateral TC (59.3 %), of these 8 cases were synchronous (diagnosed within three\u00a0months period from the primary diagnosis) and 81 metachronous (9 % and 91 % respectively). Non-testicular other primary malignancies (OPM) occurred in 61 cases (40.7 %), of which 59 cases were metachronous (96.7 %) and two cases were synchronous (3.3 %). Metachronous malignancies included mainly prostate cancer (n = 17 patients), kidney cancer (n = 13 patients) and colorectal cancer (n = 12 patients). Synchronous OPM was found in two patients.In our study we registered two cases of synchronous OPM, both histologically clear cell renal cancer. We have analyzed clinical characteristics, diagnosis and treatment strategies of synchronous OPM, in order to improve its diagnosis and therapy (Fig. 3, Ref. 22)."

    "content": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had profound effects on population health to date. African American cancer survivors are particularly vulnerable to developing severe consequences; therefore, understanding the impact of the virus on this patient population is critical.The Detroit Research on Cancer Survivors cohort is a unique effort to understand the determinants of poor outcomes in African American cancer survivors. To date, more than 4500 cancer survivors and nearly 950 primary caregivers have been enrolled; participation includes a survey and the collection of biospecimens, medical records, and tumor tissue. Beginning in the spring of 2020, a supplemental survey focusing on the impact of COVID-19 was offered to enrolled participants. The analysis included 890 survivors.Nearly all survivors (>99%) reported changes in their daily activities in an effort to reduce the risk of infection. More than 40% of the survivors reported some disruption in their access to medical care. A substantial proportion of the survivors (>40%) reported feeling anxious, depressed, and/or isolated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately 40% of the patients reported changes in health behaviors shown to negatively affect survivorship outcomes (physical inactivity, smoking, and alcohol use) as a result of the pandemic.The influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on African American cancer survivors is substantial: it has affected both their physical and mental health. Coupled with changes in health behaviors, these factors will likely affect outcomes in this high-risk patient population, and this makes further study and interventions necessary to mitigate the long-term impact of the pandemic on cancer outcomes."

Survivors of childhood cancer are at increased risk of long-term complications of therapeutic exposure. Second malignant neoplasms are one of the most severe side effects of cancer treatment. The frequency and type of secondary cancers may vary depending on the initial diagnosis, treatment administered and genetic predisposition. This review highlights the risk factors in the development of SMNs in survivors of pediatric cancers and their differences according to primary cancer type, genetic predisposition and treatment admistered. Finally, the review emphasizes the need for life-time follow-up of survivors of childhood cancer for the development of second malignancies."

    "content": "Unlike Medicare, the Veterans Health Administration (VA) health care system does not require veterans with cancer to make the \"terrible choice\" between receipt of hospice services or disease-modifying chemotherapy/radiation therapy. For this report, the authors characterized the VA's provision of concurrent care, defined as days in the last 6 months of life during which veterans simultaneously received hospice services and chemotherapy or radiation therapy.This retrospective cohort study included veteran decedents with cancer during 2006 through 2012 who were identified from claims with cancer diagnoses. Hospice and cancer treatment were identified using VA and Medicare administrative data. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the changes in concurrent care, hospice, palliative care, and chemotherapy or radiation treatment.The proportion of veterans receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy remained stable at approximately 45%, whereas the proportion of veterans who received hospice increased from 55% to 68%. The receipt of concurrent care also increased during this time from 16.2% to 24.5%. The median time between hospice initiation and death remained stable at around 21 days. Among veterans who received chemotherapy or radiation therapy in their last 6 months of life, the median time between treatment termination and death ranged from 35 to 40 days. There was considerable variation between VA medical centers in the use of concurrent care (interquartile range, 16%-34% in 2012).Concurrent receipt of hospice and chemotherapy or radiation therapy increased among veterans dying from cancer without reductions in the receipt of cancer therapy. This approach reflects the expansion of hospice services in the VA with VA policy allowing the concurrent receipt of hospice and antineoplastic therapies.

    "content": "This study evaluates the independent association of Medicaid expansion on stage of presentation among patients of Black and White race with colorectal (CRC), breast, or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).A cohort study of patients with CRC, breast cancer, or NSCLC (2009-2017) in the National Cancer Database was performed. Difference-in-differences (DID) analysis was used to compare changes in tumor stage at diagnosis between Medicaid expansion (MES) and non-expansion states (non-MES) before and after expansion. Predictive margins were calculated by race, year, and insurance status to account for effect heterogeneity. Stage migration was determined by measuring the combined proportional increase in stage I and decrease in stage IV disease at diagnosis.Black patients gained less Medicaid coverage than White patients (6.0% vs 13.1%, p\u2009<\u20090.001) after expansion. Among Black and White patients, there was a shift towards increased early-stage diagnosis (DID 3.5% and 3.5%, respectively; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and decreased late-stage diagnosis (DID White: -3.5%; Black -2.5%; p\u2009<\u20090.001) in MES compared to non-MES following expansion. Overall stage migration was greater for White compared to Black patients with CRC (10.3% vs. 5.1%) and NSCLC (8.1% vs. 6.7%) after expansion. Stage migration effects in patients with breast cancer were similar by race (White 4.8% vs. Black 4.5%).An increased proportion of Black and White patients residing in Medicaid expansion states presented with earlier stage cancer following Medicaid expansion. However, because the proportion of Black patients is higher in non-expansion states, national racial disparities in cancer stage at presentation appear worse following Medicaid expansion."

    "content": "Shared decision-making (SDM) occurs when a patient partners with their oncologist to integrate personal preferences and values into treatment decisions. A key component of SDM is the elicitation of patient preferences and values, yet little is known about how and when these are elicited, communicated, prioritized, and documented within clinical encounters.This cross-sectional study evaluated nationwide data collected by CancerCare to better understand current patterns of SDM between patients and their oncology clinicians. Patient surveys included questions about the importance of quality-of-life preferences and discussions regarding quality-of-life priorities with their clinicians. Clinician surveys included questions about the discussion of quality-of-life priorities and preferences with patients, the effect of quality-of-life priorities on treatment recommendations, and quality-of-life priority documentation in practice.Patient survey completers (n\u00a0=\u00a0320; 33% response rate) were predominantly women (95%), had a diagnosis of breast cancer (59%), or were receiving active cancer treatment (59%). Clinician survey completers (n\u00a0=\u00a0112; 5% response rate) predominately identified as hematologists or oncologists (66%). Although 67% of clinicians reported knowing their patients' personal quality-of-life priorities and preferences before finalizing treatment plans, only 37% of patients reported that these discussions occurred before treatment initiation. Most patients (95%) considered out-of-pocket expenses important during treatment planning, yet only 59% reported discussing out-of-pocket expenses with their clinician before finalizing treatment plans. A majority of clinicians (52%) considered clinic questionnaires as feasible to document quality-of-life priorities and preferences.Patients and clinicians reported that preferences related to quality-of-life should be considered in treatment decision making, yet barriers to SDM, preference elicitation, and documentation remain."

    "content": "Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are precursor lesions of pancreatic cancer, which is characterized by an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Yet, the spatial distribution of the immune infiltrate and how it changes during IPMN progression is just beginning to be understood.We obtained tissue samples from patients who underwent pancreatic surgery for IPMN, and performed comprehensive immunohistochemical analyses to investigate the clinical significance, composition and spatial organization of the immune microenvironment during progression of IPMNs. Survival analysis of pancreatic cancer patients was stratified by tumour infiltrating immune cell subtypes.The immune microenvironment evolves from a diverse T cell mixture, comprising CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, Th/c1 and Th/c2 as major players combined with Th9, Th/c17, Th22, and Treg cells in low-grade IPMN, to a Treg dominated immunosuppressive state in invasive pancreatic cancer. Organized lymphoid clusters formed in IPMN surrounding stroma and accumulated immunosuppressive cell types during tumour progression. Survival of pancreatic cancer patients correlated with Th2 signatures in the tumour microenvironment.The major change with regards to T cell composition during IPMN progression occurs at the step of tissue invasion, indicating that malignant transformation only occurs when tumour immune surveillance is overcome. This suggests that novel immunotherapies that would boost spontaneous antitumor immunity at premalignant states could prevent pancreatic cancer development.The present work was supported by German Cancer Aid grants (70,112,720 and 70,113,167) to S.

Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 18 registries database, the authors examined childhood and adolescent cancer survival by rural/urban residence as defined by Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCCs).The authors obtained data from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 18 registries for individuals diagnosed at ages birth to 19 years with a first primary malignant cancer from 2000 through 2010. Rural/urban residence at the time of diagnosis was defined using both metropolitan/nonmetropolitan county classifications and individual RUCC categories. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to compute adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the association between rural/urban residence and cancer survival. The authors also examined effect modification by age group, sex, race/ethnicity, and cancer type.Among 41,879 cancer cases, approximately 54.7% were non-Hispanic white, 54.3% were male, and 90.4% lived in a metropolitan county. Individuals living in nonmetropolitan counties versus metropolitan counties had a similar risk of cancer death (HR, \u202f1.03; 95% CI, 0.94-1.13) as did those living in nonmetropolitan rural counties with <2500 individuals nonadjacent to a metropolitan area versus those living in metropolitan counties of \u22651 million individuals (HR, \u202f0.98; 95% CI, 0.71-1.37). Evidence for effect modification largely was absent.The results of the current study suggest that childhood and adolescent cancer survival in the United States does not vary by rural/urban residence at the time of diagnosis as defined by RUCCs. The widespread availability of public health insurance for children and adolescents and a nationwide network of pediatric cancer providers may explain this finding."

The distant relapse-free survival (DRFS) between Black and White women with localized breast cancer who participated in National Cancer Institute-sponsored clinical trial was evaluated.Pooled data were analyzed from 8 National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) trials including 9702 women with localized breast cancer treated with adjuvant chemotherapy (AC, n = 7485) or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC, n = 2217), who self-reported as Black (n = 1070) or White (n = 8632) race. The association between race and DRFS was analyzed using log-rank tests and multivariate Cox regression.After adjustment for covariates including age, tumor size, nodal status, body mass index and taxane use, and treatment (AC vs NAC), Black race was associated with an inferior DRFS in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+; hazard ratio [HR], 1.24; 95% CI, 1.05-1.46; P = .01), but not in ER- disease (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.83-1.14; P = .73), and significant interaction between race and ER status was observed (P = .03). There was no racial disparity in DRFS among patients with pathologic complete response (pCR) (log-rank P = .8). For patients without pCR, Black race was associated with worse DRFS in ER+ (HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.14-2.45; P = .01), but not in ER- disease (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.65-1.28; P = .59).Black race was associated with significantly inferior DRFS in ER+ localized breast cancer treated with AC or NAC, but not in ER- disease. In the NAC group, racial disparity was also observed in patients with residual ER+ breast cancer at surgery, but not in those who had pCR.Black women with breast cancer have worse outcomes compared with White women. We investigated if this held true in the context of clinical trials that provide controlled treatment setting. Black women with cancer expressing estrogen receptors (ERs) had worse outcome than White women. If breast cancers did not express ERs, there was no racial disparity in outcome. We also observed racial disparity in women who received chemotherapy before their cancer was removed, but only if they had cancer expressing ERs and residual disease on completion of treatment. If the cancer disappeared with presurgical chemotherapy, there was no racial disparity."

The authors developed the Compassionate High-Alert Team (CHAT) intervention to manage patients receiving opioids for cancer pain who demonstrate NMOU behavior. The objective of this study was to determine the change in frequency of NMOU behaviors, pain intensity, and opioid requirements among those who received the intervention.A total of 130 patients receiving opioids for cancer pain that had documented evidence of NMOU and received the CHAT intervention were reviewed. Demographic and clinical information such as NMOU behaviors, pain scores, and morphine equivalent daily dose at baseline, 3, and 6\u2009months post-intervention was obtained.NMOU behaviors significantly decreased from a median (interquartile range) of 2 (1-3) at baseline to 0 (0-1) at both 3 and 6\u2009months post-intervention (p\u2009<\u2009.001). A total of 45 of 75 (60%) and 31 of 50 (62%) of CHAT recipients achieved complete response to the intervention at 3 and 6\u2009months, respectively.

To the authors' knowledge, few studies to date have characterized symptom burden in hospitalized patients with potentially curable cancers. The objective of the current study was to compare symptom burden, palliative care consultation, and readmission rates in hospitalized patients by cancer type and treatment intent.The authors conducted a single-center study of hospitalized patients with cancer between 2014 and 2017. They assessed physical symptoms using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System and psychological distress using the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 and the Primary Care PTSD (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder) Screen. Multivariate linear regression models were used to assess symptom burden, logistic regression was used to assess palliative care use, and competing risk regression was used to compare 90-day readmission risk.A total of 1549 patients were enrolled and surveyed. The majority of patients reported moderate to severe fatigue, poor well-being, and drowsiness with no significant differences noted by cancer type and treatment intent. Compared with other groups, patients with incurable solid cancer reported higher physical symptoms (beta coefficient [B], 4.73; P\u00a0<\u00a0.01) and symptoms of depression (B, 0.44; P\u00a0<\u00a0.01) and anxiety (B, 0.39; P\u00a0<\u00a0.01), but no difference in posttraumatic stress disorder. Among patients in the top quartile symptom burden according to the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System, the palliative care service was consulted in 14.7%, 7.9%, 25.0%, and 49.6%, respectively, of patients with potentially curable hematologic, potentially curable solid, incurable hematologic, and incurable solid cancers (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Compared with patients with potentially curable solid cancer, patients in each group experienced a higher risk of readmission within 90\u00a0days.Hospitalized patients with cancer experience substantial physical and psychological symptoms. Palliative care rarely is consulted for highly symptomatic patients with potentially curable cancers. Supportive care interventions should target the needs of symptomatic patients regardless of treatment intent."

    "content": "Mutation analysis using next-generation sequencing highlights the features of tumors with somatic alterations. However, the mutation profile of double cancer remains unclear. Here, we analyzed tumors derived from the same patient using whole exome sequencing (WES) to investigate the coherence of somatic mutations in double cancer.First, the tumor mutational burden (TMB) was investigated using WES of 5521 tumor specimens from a Japanese pan-cancer cohort. The frequencies of mutation concordance were then compared in these cancers. Finally, we calculated the expected value of mutational concordance fitting a Poisson distribution to determine the relationship between double and metastatic cancers.In all, 44, 58, and 121 paired samples were diagnosed as double cancer, multifocal lesions (derived from identical tissues), and metastasis, respectively. Our analysis revealed that common somatic mutations were almost entirely absent in double cancer, whereas primary tumors and metastatic foci harbored several identical alterations. Concordance of the mutation profile in the same patient reflects the tumor origin and development, suggesting the potential for identifying double cancer based on common somatic mutations. Furthermore, according to a Poisson distribution, double cancer could be discriminated based on paired samples from the same patient. The probability of double cancer with more than 10 mutations was \u22641 part-per-billion (ppb, 10<sup>-\u20099</sup>). In multifocal lesions, 74% of tumor pairs accumulated \u226410 common mutations, implying a difference in tumor origin within identical tissues.These findings indicate that counting common somatic mutations can indicate the differences in origin between tumors derived from the same patient. Our mutation coherence analysis can thus provide beneficial information for diagnosing double cancer."

The survey respondents consisted of 40,482 heterosexual and sexual minority men and 69,302 heterosexual and sexual minority women who identified as White, Black, or Hispanic. Logistic regression models compared White, Black, and Hispanic male and female cancer survivors' health status, depression, and health-related quality of life by sexual orientation. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics and access to care.Mental health findings showed consistency, with sexual minority male and female cancer survivors having 2 to 3 times greater odds of depression and/or poor mental health among White, Black, and Hispanic survivors. Among White women, sexual minorities reported greater odds of fair or poor health, poor physical health, and poor activity days, whereas White sexual minority men showed similar odds in comparison with their heterosexual counterparts. Among Black and Hispanic sexual minority men and women, differences in the odds of fair or poor health, poor physical health, and poor activity days in comparison with their heterosexual counterparts were mostly explained by sociodemographic and access-to-care factors.Physical and mental health outcomes vary in relation to sexual orientation and race/ethnicity among both female and male cancer survivors. Clinicians, researchers, and health care administrators must better understand and address the unique needs of cancer survivors in relation to multiple axes of social inequality to advance cancer equity."

    "content": "Social determinants of health (SDOHs) cluster together and can have deleterious impacts on health outcomes. Individually, SDOHs increase the risk of cancer mortality, but their cumulative burden is not well understood. The authors sought to determine the combined effect of SDOH on cancer mortality.Using the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort, the authors studied 29,766 participants aged 45+ years and followed them 10+ years. Eight potential SDOHs were considered, and retained SDOHs that were associated with cancer mortality (P < .10) were retained to create a count (0, 1, 2, 3+). Cox proportional hazard models estimated associations between the SDOH count and cancer mortality through December 31, 2017, adjusting for confounders. Models were age-stratified (45-64 vs 65+ years).Participants were followed for a median of 10.6 years (interquartile range [IQR], 6.5, 12.7 years). Low education, low income, zip code poverty, poor public health infrastructure, lack of health insurance, and social isolation were significantly associated with cancer mortality. In adjusted models, among those <65 years, compared to no SDOHs, having 1 SDOH (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.39; 95% CI, 1.11-1.75), 2 SDOHs (aHR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.26-2.07), and 3+ SDOHs (aHR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.58-2.75) were associated with cancer mortality (P for trend <.0001). Among individuals 65+ years, compared to no SDOH, having 1 SDOH (aHR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.00-1.35) and 3+ SDOHs (aHR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.04-1.52) was associated with cancer mortality (P for trend = .032).A greater number of SDOHs were significantly associated with an increased risk of cancer mortality, which persisted after adjustment for confounders."

    "title": "Acute Immune Signatures and Their Legacies in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 Infected Cancer Patients.",
    "content": "Given the immune system's importance for cancer surveillance and treatment, we have investigated how it may be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection of cancer patients. Across some heterogeneity in tumor type, stage, and treatment, virus-exposed solid cancer patients display a dominant impact of SARS-CoV-2, apparent from the resemblance of their immune signatures to those for COVID-19<sup>+</sup> non-cancer patients. This is not the case for hematological malignancies, with virus-exposed patients collectively displaying heterogeneous humoral responses, an exhausted T\u00a0cell phenotype and a high prevalence of prolonged virus shedding. Furthermore, while recovered solid cancer patients' immunophenotypes resemble those of non-virus-exposed cancer patients, recovered hematological cancer patients display distinct, lingering immunological legacies. Thus, while solid cancer patients, including those with advanced disease, seem no more at risk of SARS-CoV-2-associated immune dysregulation than the general population, hematological cancer patients show complex immunological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 exposure that might usefully inform their care."

    "content": "Approximately 40% of patients with cancer also have another chronic medical condition. Patient-centered medical homes (PCMHs) have improved outcomes among patients with multiple chronic comorbidities. The authors first evaluated the impact of a cancer diagnosis on chronic medication adherence among patients with Medicaid coverage and, second, whether PCMHs influenced outcomes among patients with cancer.Using linked 2004 to 2010 North Carolina cancer registry and claims data, the authors included Medicaid enrollees who were diagnosed with breast, colorectal, or lung cancer who had hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and/or diabetes mellitus. Using difference-in-difference methods, the authors examined adherence to chronic disease medications as measured by the change in the percentage of days covered over time among patients with and without cancer. The authors then further evaluated whether PCMH enrollment modified the observed differences between those patients with and without cancer using a differences-in-differences-in-differences approach. The authors examined changes in health care expenditures and use as secondary outcomes.Patients newly diagnosed with cancer who had hyperlipidemia experienced a 7-percentage point to 11-percentage point decrease in the percentage of days covered compared with patients without cancer. Patients with cancer also experienced significant increases in medical expenditures and hospitalizations compared with noncancer controls. Changes in medication adherence over time between patients with and without cancer were not determined to be statistically significantly different by PCMH status. Some PCMH patients with cancer experienced smaller increases in expenditures (diabetes) and emergency department use (hyperlipidemia) but larger increases in their inpatient hospitalization rates (hypertension) compared with non-PCMH patients with cancer relative to patients without cancer.PCMHs were not found to be associated with improvements in chronic disease medication adherence, but were associated with lower costs and emergency department visits among some low-income patients with cancer."

    "content": "Extant evidence links neighborhood walkability with obesity-related health in the general population. This association likely exists in cancer survivors, but research is limited. Furthermore, a disproportionate obesity burden in African American cancer survivors warrants subgroup-specific analyses.This study analyzed data from 2089 African American cancer survivors participating in the Detroit Research on Cancer Survivors (ROCS) cohort. On the basis of built environment data summarized within 1-km radial buffers around census block centroids, a multidimensional neighborhood walkability index (NWI) was constructed. Survivors' residential addresses at Detroit ROCS enrollment were geocoded, and addresses were linked to NWI scores via the census block of residence. At study enrollment, survivors reported height and weight; these data were used to calculate their body mass index (BMI). Associations between NWI quartiles and BMI overall and by cancer type, biological sex, and physical activity engagement were evaluated.BMI was found to be inversely associated with increasing NWI quartile (P for trend < .01). This inverse relationship was observed in men (P for trend < .01) and in survivors reporting any regular physical activity (P for trend < .01).This study's findings suggest that among African American cancer survivors, higher neighborhood walkability is associated with lower BMI. As health care systems in the United States increasingly consider the role of the neighborhood environment in their patients' health, these findings provide additional evidence supporting health systems' incorporation of neighborhood walkability as an obesity-related health indicator for this cancer survivor subgroup and potentially for cancer survivors from other vulnerable populations."

    "content": "Research is lacking for understanding the health disparities in cancer survivorship in the lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) population in the United States. Self-reported health status is used as a predictor of health disparities.This secondary data analysis study used 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data to analyze cancer survivorship characteristics by sexual orientation and sex through the use of logistic regressions.Overall, 17,656,329 US cancer survivors were included in this study after weighting, with percentage estimates of 1.52% for gays/lesbians and 1.41% for bisexuals. LGB participants were younger and more ethnically diverse. Significantly, bisexuals had current smoking (32.3% vs 13.6%) and binge drinking rates (17.1% vs 9.1%) twice those of heterosexuals; 16.6% of bisexuals versus 4.1% of heterosexuals reported no health insurance coverage (P < .0001). After adjustments for socioeconomic, health-related behavioral risk, and health care access factors, bisexual females reported poorer general health (odds ratio [OR], 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.31-1.36) as well as mental health (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 2.39-2.46) than their heterosexual peers (P < .0001). Bisexual males were 5.14 times more likely to be told that they had depressive disorders than their heterosexual counterparts (95% CI, 5.05-5.23), whereas bisexual females were 3.23 times more likely for the same outcome (95% CI, 3.18-3.28). All LGB groups reported significantly more inadequate sleep than their heterosexual counterparts (especially lesbians: OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 2.10-2.18).This study indicates that LGB cancer survivors have worse survivorship than their heterosexual peers with heterogeneity in subgroups. Future studies should use larger sample sizes, further investigate disparities, and promote survivorship in LGB populations.It has been observed that lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) cancer survivors may face challenges in cancer survivorship that are not as prevalent in the heterosexual community. This cross-sectional study has found that LGB cancer survivors, especially bisexuals, have overall poorer physical and mental health, are more likely to be told that they have depressive disorders, and have worse sleep quality in comparison with their heterosexual counterparts. These results also differ by sex, and this can provide rationales for future studies and guide interventions to relocate resources to better promote equality."

    "content": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes 10% of cancers among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected people in the United States. Because Hispanics are disproportionally affected by the HIV epidemic and by infection-related cancers, this study compared incidence rates for HPV-related cancers and survival between Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites (NHWs) and non-Hispanic blacks (NHBs) in the HIV-infected US population.Based on data from the HIV/AIDS Cancer Match Study, standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were used to estimate cancer risk in HIV-infected Hispanics and the general US Hispanic population. Among HIV-infected people, cancer rates were compared with incidence rate ratios (IRRs), and survival was compared with hazard ratios between Hispanics and NHWs and NHBs.Five hundred two HPV-related cancers occurred in 864,067 person-years of follow-up among HIV-infected Hispanics. Except for oropharyngeal cancer, the risk of HPV-related cancers was higher among HIV-infected Hispanics than in the general population (SIR range, 3.59 [cervical cancer] to 18.7 [anal cancer in men]). Among HIV-infected females, Hispanics had higher cervical cancer rates than NHWs (IRR, 1.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19-2.43) but lower vulvar cancer rates than NHWs (IRR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.24-0.67) and NHBs (IRR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.41-0.95). Among HIV-infected males, Hispanics had higher penile cancer rates than NHWs (IRR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.36-4.96) but lower anal cancer rates than NHWs (IRR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.46-0.63) and NHBs (IRR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.56-0.77). Among HIV-infected Hispanics, 5-year survival was greater than 50% across HPV-related cancer types, with no major differences by racial/ethnic group.HIV-infected Hispanics have an elevated risk for HPV-related cancers. Similarly to the general population, HIV-infected Hispanics have higher rates of cervical and penile cancer than NHWs and NHBs. HPV vaccination should be promoted among HIV-infected individuals to reduce the burden of HPV-related cancers."

    "content": "Breast cancer survivors are at an increased risk of developing certain types of hematologic malignant neoplasm after diagnosis.To estimate the incidence of various types of hematologic malignant neoplasm in breast cancer survivors, both in absolute terms and in association with the general population.This nationwide cohort study conducted in France used data from the French National Health Data System, a database that contains all of French residents' health-related expenses. All French women aged 20 to 85 years with an incident breast cancer diagnosis between July 1, 2006, and December 31, 2015, were included (n\u2009=\u2009439 704) and followed up until hematologic malignant neoplasm occurrence, death, loss of follow-up, or December 31, 2016, whichever came first. Comparisons were made with all French women in the general population who were registered in the French general health insurance program each year from January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2016. Data analysis was performed from January 23, 2018, to May 25, 2018.Main outcomes were incident hematologic malignant neoplasm cases occurring at least 6 months after breast cancer diagnosis. The various types of hematologic malignant neoplasm considered were acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), multiple myeloma (MM), Hodgkin lymphoma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (HL/NHL), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphocytic lymphoma (ALL/LL). Incidence of these various types was estimated among breast cancer survivors and compared with the incidence in women in the general population.The 439\u202f704 women in the study had a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 59 (50-69) years and were followed up for a median (IQR) duration of 5 (2.8-7.5) years. Overall, 3046 cases of hematologic malignant neoplasm occurred: 509 cases (16.7%) of AML (crude incidence rate [CIR] per 100 000 person-years, 24.5; 95% CI, 22.4-26.8), 832 cases (27.3%) of MDS (CIR, 40.1; 95% CI, 37.4-42.9), and 267 cases (8.8%) of MPN (CIR, 12.8; 95% CI, 11.4-14.5). Lymphoid neoplasm cases included 420 cases (13.8%) of MM (CIR, 20.3; 95% CI, 18.4-22.3), 912 cases (29.9%) of HL/NHL (CIR, 44.4; 95% CI, 41.1-50.0), and 106 cases (3.5%) of ALL/LL (CIR, 5.1; 95% CI, 4.2-6.2). Compared with the general population, breast cancer survivors had statistically significantly higher incidence of AML (standardized incidence rate ratio [SIRR], 2.8; 95% CI, 2.5-3.2) and MDS (SIRR, 5.0; 95% CI, 4.4-5.7) and, to a lesser extent, MM (SIRR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3-1.7]) and ALL/LL (SIRR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3-3.0).The finding that AML and MDS still occur among breast cancer survivors today, and that ALL/LL and MM may also be of concern, merits the continuous monitoring of hematologic malignant neoplasms and the thorough investigations into their underlying mechanisms."

    "content": "Phase 1 trials are increasingly important in the molecularly driven era of oncology, but few studies have examined phase 1 participation disparities. The authors of this study investigated factors associated with phase 1 versus phase 2/3 trial enrollment.They authors conducted a cross-sectional study using serial samples of patients age \u226518 years enrolling on cancer trials from October 2011 to November 2014 at an academic cancer center. They used univariable and multivariable logistic regression models to analyze sociodemographic and clinical associations with phase 1 versus phase 2/3 trial enrollment.Among 3103 patients enrolled in cancer trials, 2657 unique patients participated in phase 1/2/3 trials. For patients enrolled in phase 1 (n = 1401) versus phase 2/3 (n = 1256) trials, we found no significant differences by age, insurance status, marital status, and income. Overall, 1216 (93%) White, 72 (6%) Asian, and 21 (2%) Black patients enrolled on phase 1 trials, whereas 1068 (93%) White, 40 (3%) Asian, and 43 (4%) Black patients enrolled on phase 2/3 trials. Adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, insurance status, marital status, income, cancer type, disease status, travel distance, and trial year, compared with White patients, Black patients had lower phase 1 enrollment (odds ratio [OR], 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25-0.82), as did Hispanic/Latino (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.08-0.79) and male patients (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62-0.94). Asian patients had higher phase 1 enrollment (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.88-2.16).Disparities in phase 1 versus phase 2/3 cancer clinical trial enrollment underscore the urgent need for interventions addressing inequities in early-phase trial participation.Phase 1 trials are of increasing importance in oncology. The authors of the study analyzed all patients enrolling on cancer clinical trials at a large academic cancer center from October 2011 to November 2014. Among the 2657 trial participants, when age, sex, race, ethnicity, insurance status, marital status, income, cancer type, disease status, travel distance, and trial year were taken into account, Black, Hispanic/Latino, and male patients were less likely to enroll on phase 1 trials versus phase 2/3 trials. These findings suggest a need for targeted interventions to improve access to and education about phase 1 trials for Black and Hispanic/Latino patients."

    "content": "Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, and researchers seek to identify modifiable risk factors Over the past several decades, there has been ongoing debate whether opioids are associated with cancer development, metastasis, or recurrence. Basic science, clinical, and observational studies have produced conflicting results. The authors examined the association between prescription opioids and incident cancers using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. A complex relation was observed between prescription opioids and incident cancer, and cancer site may be an important determinant.By using linked SEER cancer registry and Medicare claims from 2008 through 2013, a case-control study was conducted examining the relation between cancer onset and prior opioid exposure. Logistic regression was used to account for differences between cases and controls for 10 cancer sites.Of the population studied (n = 348,319), 34% were prescribed opioids, 79.5% were white, 36.9% were dually eligible (for both Medicare and Medicaid), 13% lived in a rural area, 52.7% had \u22651 comorbidity, and 16% had a smoking-related diagnosis. Patients exposed to opioids had a lower odds ratio (OR) associated with breast cancer (adjusted OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.92-0.99) and colon cancer (adjusted OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.86-0.93) compared with controls. Higher ORs for kidney cancer, leukemia, liver cancer, lung cancer, and lymphoma, ranging from lung cancer (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07) to liver cancer (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.08-1.31), were present in the exposed population.The current results suggest that an association exists between prescription opioids and incident cancer and that cancer site may play an important role. These findings can direct future research on specific patient populations that may benefit or be harmed by prescription opioid exposure."

    "content": "Although there are a growing number of survivors of adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer, to the authors' knowledge the long-term overall survival (OS) patterns for AYA cancer survivors are underreported. The objective of the current study was to assess the long-term survival of AYA cancer survivors and identify factors associated with diminished long-term survival.The authors used The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center's tumor registry to identify 5-year survivors of cancer diagnosed as AYAs (ages 15-39\u00a0years) between the years 1970 and 2005, and who were alive 5\u00a0years after diagnosis. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate OS rates over time, and Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to evaluate the association of covariates with OS.The authors identified 16,728 individuals who were 5-year survivors of cancer and were diagnosed as AYAs with a median follow-up of 20.0\u00a0years. The 10-year, 20-year, and 25-year OS rates were 86% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 85%-86%), 74% (95% CI, 73%-75%), and 68% (95% CI, 67%-68%), respectively, all of which were lower than the age-adjusted estimated survival rates of the general population. Long-term OS improved for AYAs diagnosed between 2000 and 2005 compared with those diagnosed in the prior decades (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Older age at the time of diagnosis, receipt of radiation, and diagnoses including central nervous system tumors and breast cancer each were associated with diminished long-term survival.AYA cancer survivors have inferior long-term survival compared with the general population. Studies investigating the prevalence and types of late treatment effects and causes of death among AYA survivors are needed to more accurately identify AYAs who are at highest risk of early or late mortality."

The authors compared MH outcomes between respondents with a cancer history and respondents without a cancer history in adjusted analyses controlling for demographics and socioeconomic status. Outcomes included past-year major depressive episodes, serious psychological distress, suicidal thoughts, suicidal plans, suicidal attempts, any mental illness, and serious mental illness. All analyses were stratified by age group (18-34, 35-49, or 50-64\u00a0years).In a comparison of 2656 survivors and 112,952 individuals without cancer, within each age group, survivors had an elevated prevalence of MH problems in 5 of the 7 outcome measures. Among young adults (aged 18-34\u00a0years), survivors were more likely than noncancer counterparts to experience major depressive episodes (18.1% vs 9.6%), serious psychological distress (34.2% vs 17.9%), suicidal thoughts (10.5% vs 7.0%), any mental illness (41.1% vs 23.3%), and serious mental illness (13.2% vs 5.9%) in the past year (P values <.05). These differences persisted in adjusted analyses (P values <.01). Similar survivor-comparison differences were observed among older groups but with a smaller magnitude. Among survivors, young adult survivors had the highest likelihood of experiencing MH problems across all outcomes (P values <.05).This population-based study shows an elevated prevalence of MH problems among adult cancer survivors in comparison with the general population. This finding highlights the importance of developing strategies to ensure the early detection of mental illness and to improve access to MH treatment for cancer survivors."

    "title": "Circulating Small Extracellular Vesicles Activate TYRO3 to Drive Cancer Metastasis and Chemoresistance.",
    "content": "Extracellular vesicles (EV) in the tumor microenvironment have emerged as crucial mediators that promote proliferation, metastasis, and chemoresistance. However, the role of circulating small EVs (csEV) in cancer progression remains poorly understood. In this study, we report that csEV facilitate cancer progression and determine its molecular mechanism. csEVs strongly promoted the migration of cancer cells via interaction with phosphatidylserine of csEVs. Among the three TAM receptors, TYRO3, AXL, and MerTK, TYRO3 mainly interacted with csEVs. csEV-mediated TYRO3 activation promoted migration and metastasis via the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and stimulation of RhoA in invasive cancer cells. Additionally, csEV-TYRO3 interaction induced YAP activation, which led to increased cell proliferation and chemoresistance. Combination treatment with gefitinib and KRCT-6j, a selective TYRO3 inhibitor, significantly reduced tumor volume in xenografts implanted with gefitinib-resistant non-small cell lung cancer cells. The results of this study show that TYRO3 activation by csEVs facilitates cancer cell migration and chemoresistance by activation of RhoA or YAP, indicating that the csEV/TYRO3 interaction may serve as a potential therapeutic target for aggressive cancers in the clinic. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate that circulating extracellular vesicles are a novel driver in migration and survival of aggressive cancer cells via TYRO3 activation.

Cullin3-RING ligases (CRL3) serve as essential executors for regulating protein homeostasis in cancer development, highlighting that CRL3 might be promising targets in various cancer treatment. However, how to design new targeted therapies by disrupting the function of CRL3 is poorly understood. Here, we focus on the substrate adaptors of CRL3, and carry out a systematical research on the function of Kelch-like (KLHL) family proteins. We have identified twenty-four KLHL proteins with function of tumor promotion and thirteen KLHL proteins with high clinical significance on cancer therapy. Furthermore, we have clarified the novel biological function of KLHL13 as a vital factor that contributes to malignant progression in lung cancer. Taken together, our findings reveal multiple potential therapeutical targets and provide evidence for targeting CRL3 via KLHL substrate adaptors for cancer therapy."

    "content": "The built environment is a significant determinant of human health. Globally, the growing prevalence of preventable cancers suggests a need to understand how features of the built environment shape exposure to cancer development and distribution within a population. This scoping review examines how researchers across disparate fields understand and discuss the built environment in primary and secondary cancer prevention. It is focused exclusively on peer-reviewed sources published from research conducted in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States from 1990 to 2017. The review captured 9958 potential results in the academic literature, and this body of results was scoped to 268 relevant peer-reviewed journal articles indexed across 13 subject databases. Spatial proximity, transportation, land use, and housing are well-understood features of the built environment that shape cancer risk. Built-environment features predominantly influence air quality, substance use, diet, physical activity, and screening adherence, with impacts on breast cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and overall cancer risk. The majority of the evidence fails to provide direct recommendations for advancing cancer prevention policy and program objectives for municipalities. The expansion of interdisciplinary work in this area would serve to create a significant population health impact."

    "content": "Childhood cancer survivors have been reported to be vulnerable to psychiatric morbidities and risky health behavior. Suicides, substance abuse, accidents, and violence as causes of death can be regarded as an extreme manifestation of risky health behavior. In the current study, the authors studied the risk of suicide and other risky health behavior-related deaths among childhood cancer patients in Denmark, Finland, and Sweden.Using linkage between national cancer, population, and cause-of-death registries, the authors investigated the causes of death in 29,285 patients diagnosed with cancer before age 20\u00a0years between 1971 and 2009 compared with a cohort of 146,282 age-matched, sex-matched, and country-matched population comparisons. Rate ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs were estimated using Poisson regression models, adjusting for demographic factors.The overall risk of dying of a risky health behavior was found to be increased among childhood cancer patients (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.06-1.47) when compared with population comparisons. The elevated risk was statistically significant among patients with central nervous system tumors (RR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.08-2.05) and patients diagnosed at ages 5 to 9\u00a0years and 15 to 19\u00a0years (RR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.01-2.24] and RR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.03-1.67], respectively). The overall risk of suicide was found to be increased (RR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.02-1.83), and statistically significantly so when patients were diagnosed between ages 15 and 19\u00a0years (RR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.09-2.39).Childhood cancer patients appear to have an increased risk of risky health behavior-related causes of death compared with the general population. The results of the current study suggest the importance of integrating psychosocial support into the follow-up care of these individuals."
