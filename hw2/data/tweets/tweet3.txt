There were about 21,500 murders last year. 

There were twice as many sucidies (46,000) last year. 

There were about 400,000 Covid deaths last year. 

If current rates hold there will be abt 200,000 Covid deaths next year. 

In no way do US culture & politics reflect this.

The problem is none of this is being communicated to the public. I don’t expect it to come from politicians (we should), but not even public health officials. They are, in fact, saying the opposite: covid is a nothingburger…just the sniffles…repeated reinfection no big deal.

Took an exhausting KUL-BKK-FRA-AMS flight from KL to Amsterdam, rushing from one airport to another across 3 time zones. 

Nobody asks for Covid vaccine passports anymore. 

Also no 😷 mandates in Bangkok/ Frankfurt/ Amsterdam airports it seems, although can still see some 😷 .
