Lack of side effects after vaccination doesn’t mean the COVID-19 vaccine isn’t working, or that you received a placebo. It means that your body is reacting to the vaccine differently.  #ViralFactsAfrica

I'll repeat this again.

Being against vaccinating young children for COVID or not wanting atrocious vaccine mandates does not make you 'anti-vax'.

Not everybody needs jab after jab. It will benefit some, but not all.

That's not 'anti-vax', that's common sense.

Not one mainstream publication raised an objection to the vaccine mandates. Not one. No protests of 'my body, my choice.' Not a word about it violating basic human rights. Nothing.

Pregnant and breastfeeding women were mandated to get the vaccine and anyone who expressed concerns was censored. Now apparently “caution is warranted.” The CDC even told vaccinated mothers that their babies would get benefits from their breastmilk. This is unconscionable.
