#BTC 0.786 fib retrace of the move off the covid low. Would not consider a retest of 17k to be significant.

#GOLD down 20%, #OIL down 40%, Inflation peaked? Probable. #Bond market dislocated. #DXY vertical. Sentiment negative to historic levels. Patience.

There is no clear-cut answer; it’s hard to predict when the next surge of infection will be and exactly how long protection from existing immunity will last.

Chart from article https://thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/rbi-has-a-grip-on-inflation/article65943289.ece y'day. If India's fiscal policy in Covid had been profligate, money supply wud've ↑ sharply => we would've had much higher inflation. Contrast this to GFC when fiscal profligacy led to double-digit inflation every month for 1.5 yrs!
