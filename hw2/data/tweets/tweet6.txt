“Average COVID-19 mortality per million was 288.54 in countries without face mask policies and 48.40 in countries w/ face mask policies”

Nearly 6x the deaths in countries w/o masking, which is what we’re doing in #Canada now. 

A (very un)solid plan.

But some premiers won't even allow pharmacists to prescribe it while dozens of people die per week. This is beyond unacceptable.

Hey 
@JAMAPediatrics
 this is a highly misleading tweet. 

In a study of 11 lactating individuals there were only picogram amounts of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine detected in expressed breast milk of 5 of these individuals up to 48 hours post 💉

This is not clinically significant.

Now the Queen has a 'cold' and is covid safe by 'not shaking anyone's hand'.

 reports 90% of the approx. 60 Covid patients currently hospitalized in the county’s 4 DHS hospitals are there WITH Covid.

Therefore, 6 patients are hospitalized FOR Covid. 

The majority tested positive upon admission for something other than Covid.
