Trump paid attorney Chris Kise $3 mil from his donors and he's being sidelined within a month. DeSantis got state to pay $1.565 mil of COVID-19 relief interest to Vertol for 3 flights, 1 of which was empty. It's easy for them to blow millions when they're using other people's $$.

When the first wave of Covid came, Trump and Kushner reportedly dropped the idea of nationwide testing because the first wave was mostly hitting blue states like NY and CA.

When storms like Hurricane Ian come, Biden sends help to Florida — never mind it has a GOP governor. 🇺🇸💪

In 1980, 62 cents of every dollar spent on beef went to ranchers. Today, only 37 cents do.

During COVID, beef prices rose by nearly 16%. Meanwhile, the 4 biggest beef companies’ profits rose more than 300%.

The meat monopoly is nothing short of a nationwide crisis.

Ever since the COVID Boosters, there have been suspicions that some kind of shedding is happening between the jabbed &the unjabbed.With mass flu vaccination, the possibility of transmission is further exacerbated, and there’s no telling what kind of viral mutations will happen.

One thing I’ve learned during 23 months of Long Covid is that as patients we have to compare notes & fight for tests. For example, I had to push for a tilt table test to confirm I have POTS, & I wouldn’t have known to do that without other long-haulers sharing their experiences.
