A new study showed that people vaccinated against Covid-19 experienced a temporary delay in their periods of about one day compared with those who did not get vaccinated. One cycle after vaccination, people’s periods tended to return to normal.

Markets usually bottom out after a big last leg of the fall.

During Lehman & Covid falls, markets bottomed out after a down circuit.

Hope that does not happen now.

All India Growth Story fizzled out now, Nifty is at 15200 now in dollar terms, as Rupee depreciated by about 10%.

Iowa's fiscal health is "strong" ONLY because we received $10.4 BILLION in federal relief funds.

YOU starved public education, gutted funding for higher education, failed to fund any outdoor recreation, and allowed Iowa roads and bridges to deteriorate.
