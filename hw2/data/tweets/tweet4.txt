One of the authors of the controversial paper, well known Anti-mask-activist making fun of Covid Deaths. This paper with severe methodological mistakes has served as “scientific” support for the elimination of all preventive measures at schools. 
How the academy let this happen?

Until we make meaningful inroads into curbing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we will continue to see an accumulative burden of disease associated with COVID-19. Only a multi-layered VaccinePlus strategy can achieve this. We should stop treating SARS-CoV-2 infection as a fait accompli

Why are Republicans more concerned with Fentanyl deaths than they were about COVID deaths?

They blame Fentanyl on Democrats for some reason like we are out there selling it on the street corners.

I think the Feds have finally achieved shutting down our reporting on Aged Care COVID - while not actually stopping the "presenting" of "data" (if I had lower than lower case for the word data I would use it).

It too them 10 months to "fix us" should be proud of that

There seems to be a direct correlation between having pronouns in your bio and having an extremely dramatic, completely benign case of Covid rip through your family. Maybe the pronouns are a risk factor or even the cause. Might want to protect yourself by getting rid of them.

At what point did you, in the high risk category, realize that your "friends", or even family, didn't care if you got Covid and died? 
When did they ostracize you for asking that they take precautions to see you? 
Are they still asking you to go into unsafe environments?

I have had Type 1 diabetes for 20+ years. When I had Covid, my closed loop insulin pump used 2x as much insulin as usual (even though I didn't eat anything) and my blood sugar was still dangerously high because the pump couldn't keep up. So forgive me for keeping my mask on.
