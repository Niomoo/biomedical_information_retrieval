I am going to make a bold prediction: a decade from now, Asian countries will be doing much better than North America and Europe. Why? Because Asian societies have made masking commonplace. Meanwhile, the maskless West is suffering COVID brain damage.

- all of 2021: ~14656

This year's mild COVID waves have caused more death than all of 2021 and is potentially going to outpace 2020.

Let's see. Covid is not close to being gone. It's still killing people daily and making many others sick, sometimes for months. Universal masking works to decrease transmission. A few loudmouth idiots complain that they don’t like masks, and we cave. OK, got it.

You are correct. Have both short-term & long-term deadly virus. This virus is airborne, highly contagious, fast mutating. Damages & evades the immune system. 
Damages all organs because it is vascular.

Lots of kids at school today that are covid++. Some families sending them after 1-2 days. Our healthcare can’t handle any more than it’s been struggling with.
