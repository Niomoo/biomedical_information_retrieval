Many of us that have observed exhaled breath condensation and larger aerosol floating on a cold day instinctively knew how COVID-19 would spread… 

… but ancient dogma and powerful vested interests got in the way of that too. #COVIDisAirborne and so are a lot of other things.

Don’t get bogged down in the minutiae. 

Here are the very basic facts. 

We are still seeing serious long term damage due to COVID-19 in the post vaccination era. We are still seeing too many deaths. 

The exact amount is irrelevant when it remains high enough to impact society.
