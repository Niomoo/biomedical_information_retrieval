Useless just another ridiculous move from the QP clowns and their COVID Rapid Acquisition Plan.
 Schools are already overrun with infections even though Ford and his cretins have proclaimed the pandemic over.

Only 10.5% of S&P 500 stocks are currently trading above their 200 Day Moving Average.  During the last 15 years, it was only lower twice - During the Great Financial Crisis in late 2008/early 2009 and the first few weeks of the Covid lockdown in March 2020.

Buying cloth masks instead of respirators for a pandemic you’re pretending is over is... a choice. Perhaps the public may be less confused by:
- explaining that COVID is airborne
- providing well-fitting respirators to filter breath of infected persons and susceptible persons

The synthetic nanolipids collect in the ovaries. mRNA is found in breast milk. And the Covid injections change your periods.

But totally safe and effective and should be mandated for 3.5 billion women.

Major study of 44 countries shows that mask mandates save lives: lots of them. Average COVID mortality per million was 288.54 in countries without face mask policies and 48.40 in countries with face mask policies. Lifting mandates now is gross negligence.

If you haven't been vaccinated against Covid, please consider it. It's still very much a threat, especially to those who are older or with underlying conditions.

I am 29, otherwise healthy, received 5 vaccines, in good shape, and couldn't get out of bed for nearly 3 days.

Most have no idea that COVID is as significant as it is; for them, for those they love, & for the community generally. Fundamentally shifting mortality rates (~15% increase in 2022) & the chronic health outlook for many in the population. Clear messaging about this is essential.
