  "Breast cancer screening guidelines could provide valuable tools for clinical decision making by reviewing the available evidence and providing recommendations. Little information is known about how many countries have issued breast cancer screening guidelines and the differences among existing guidelines. We systematically reviewed current guidelines and summarized corresponding recommendations, to provide references for good clinical practice in different countries.Systematic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus from inception to March 27th, 2021 were conducted and supplemented by reviewing the guideline development organizations. The quality of screening guidelines was assessed from six domains of the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation \u2161 (AGREE \u2161)\u00a0instrument by two appraisers. The basic information and recommendations of the issued guidelines were extracted and summarized.A total of 23 guidelines issued between 2010 and 2021 in 11 countries or regions were identified for further review. The content and quality varied across the guidelines. The average AGREE \u2161 scores of the guidelines ranged from 33.3% to 87.5%. The highest domain score was \"clarity of presentation\" while the domain with the lowest score was \"applicability\". For average-risk women, most of the guidelines recommended mammographic screening for those aged 40-74 years, specifically, those aged 50-69 years were regarded as the optimal age group for screening. Nine of 23 guidelines recommended against an upper age limit for breast cancer screening. Mammography (MAM) was recommended as the primary screening modality for average-risk women by all included guidelines. Most guidelines suggested annual or biennial mammographic screening. Risk factors of breast cancer identified in the guidelines mainly fell within five categories which could be broadly summarized as the personal history of pre-cancerous lesions and/or breast cancer; the family history of breast cancer; the known genetic predisposition of breast cancer; the history of mantle or chest radiation therapy; and dense breasts. For women at higher risk, there was a consensus among most guidelines that annual MAM or annual magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be given, and the screening should begin earlier than the average-risk group.The majority of 23 included international guidelines were issued by developed countries which contained roughly the same but not identical recommendations on breast cancer screening age, methods, and intervals. Most guidelines recommended annual or biennial mammographic screening between 40 and 74 years for average-risk populations and annual MAM or annual MRI starting from a younger age for high-risk populations. Current guidelines varied in quality and increased efforts are needed to improve the methodological\u00a0quality of guidance documents. Due to lacking clinical practice guidelines tailored to different economic levels, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) should apply and implement the evidence-based guidelines with higher AGREE \u2161 scores considering local adaption.",
  "Minimal data are available to support the clinical management of older breast cancer patients. Consequently, the standard of care remains unclear. Our aim was to clarify the clinicopathological characteristics, practical treatments, and prognosis of older Japanese breast cancer patients and discuss clinical issues.We reviewed 132,240 cases, diagnosed between 2004 and 2011, from the Japanese Breast Cancer Registry. Focusing on older patients, we compared data among three age groups: 75\u00a0years and over (n\u2009=\u200927,385), 65-74\u00a0years (n\u2009=\u200943,839), and 55-64\u00a0years (n\u2009=\u200961,016).Data revealed the proportions of mucinous and apocrine carcinoma were higher in older patients, and they more frequently had clinical stage II and III cancer. Their ER-positive rates were higher, in contrast to the lower HER2-positive, breast-conserving surgery (BCS), post-BCS irradiation, and adjuvant chemotherapy rates. Almost half of the older patients who underwent chemotherapy received CMF or oral 5FU, during hormone therapy, Tamoxifen was administered more frequently. The overall survival rate decreased with age, but the breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) at 5\u00a0years remained similar. The rate of other cause of death in the oldest group was about a half, and more than double that in those aged 55-64\u00a0years.We showed clinical data of older breast cancer patients in Japan. Their disease was more advanced at the time of diagnosis, post-BCS irradiation and primary systemic chemotherapy were omitted more frequently, and overall, BCSS was similar among age categories, although the rate of other causes of death was higher.",
  "The association between breast cancer patients with a TP53 pathogenic variant and risk of local recurrence and contralateral breast cancer remains largely unknown.The study population of 11093 patients was derived from two cohorts at the Breast Center of Peking University Cancer Hospital in China from November 2003, to March 2018. TP53 germline variants were determined for all patients.In the study, forty-one (0.37%) carried a TP53 germline pathogenic variant, and 11052 were non-carriers (99.63%). Nineteen TP53 carriers (46.3%) and 4173 non-carriers (37.8%) were treated with breast-conserving therapy (BCT), while the remaining were treated with mastectomy. After a median follow-up of 6.7 years, the rate of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) in TP53 carriers was significantly higher than that in non-carriers when treated with BCT (21.1% vs 3.8%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.006). No difference in the rate of IBTR was found between TP53 carriers and non-carriers when treated with mastectomy (0.0% vs 2.6%, P\u00a0=\u00a01.0). Furthermore, the rate of IBTR in TP53 carriers treated with BCT was significantly higher than that in those treated with mastectomy (21.1% vs 0.0%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.038). The 10-year cumulative risk of contralateral breast cancer in TP53 carriers was significantly higher than that in non-carriers (17.9% vs 3.6%, hazard ratio (HR)\u00a0=\u00a07.0, 95% CI: 3.3-14.9, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).Patients with TP53 variants have a high risk of IBTR when treated with BCT, and exhibit a very high risk of contralateral breast cancer. TP53 carriers may not be suitable for BCT and prophylactic contralateral mastectomy might be considered.",
  "The Japanese Breast Cancer Society Registry started in 1975; it was transferred to the registry platform of the National Clinical Database in 2012. We provide the annual data and an analysis of the Breast Cancer Registry for 2017.Patients' characteristics and pathological data of the 95,203 registered Japanese breast cancer patients from 1,427 institutes in 2017 were obtained. Trends in age at diagnosis and pathological stage were determined during the most recent 6\u00a0years (2012-2017).The mean onset age was 60.2\u00a0years with bimodal peaks at 45-49\u00a0years and 65-69\u00a0years. A short-term trend of the most recent 6\u00a0years of data caused the second, older peak. At diagnosis, 32.4% of breast cancer patients were premenopausal. The distribution of stages revealed that the proportion of early stage breast cancer (stage 0-I) increased up to 60%. At the initial diagnosis, 2.2% of patients presented with metastatic disease. Sentinel node biopsy without axillary node dissection was performed without neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in 68.8%, and with NAC in 31.1%, of patients. For patients without NAC, lymph node metastasis was less than 3% if the tumor size was less than 1\u00a0cm. The proportion of node-negativity decreased to 79.5% when tumor size was 2.1-5\u00a0cm.This analysis of the registry provides new information for effective treatment in clinical practice, cancer prevention, and the conduct of clinical trials. Further development of the registry and progress in collecting prognostic data will greatly enhance its scientific value.",
  "To evaluate the effect of irregular screening behaviour on the risk of advanced stage breast cancer at diagnosis in Flanders.All women aged 50-69 who were invited to the organized breast cancer screening and diagnosed with breast cancer before age 72 from 2001 to 2018 were included. All prevalent screen and interval cancers within 2 years of a prevalent screen were excluded. Screening behaviour was categorized based on the number of invitations and performed screenings. Four groups were defined: regular, irregular, only-once, and never attenders. Advanced stage cancer was defined as a stage III\u00a0+\u00a0breast cancer. The association between screening regularity and breast cancer stage at diagnosis was evaluated in multivariable logistic regression models, taking age of diagnosis and socio-economic status into account.In total 13.5% of the 38,005 breast cancer cases were diagnosed at the advanced stage. Compared to the regular attenders, the risk of advanced stage breast cancer for the irregular attenders, women who participated only-once, and never attenders was significantly higher with OR<sub>adjusted</sub>:1.17 (95%CI:1.06-1.29) and OR<sub>adjusted</sub>:2.18 (95%CI:1.94-2.45), and OR<sub>adjusted</sub>:5.95 (95%CI:5.33-6.65), respectively.In our study, never attenders were nearly six times more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage breast cancer than regular attenders, which was much higher than the estimates published thus far. An explanation for this is that the ever screened women is a heterogeneous group regarding the participation profiles which also includes irregular and only-once attenders. The benefit of regular screening should be informed to all women invited for screening.",
  "Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women. Clinical models such as Oncotype DX recurrence score (RS) and Clinical Treatment Score post-5 years (CTS5) model for survival prediction are crucial for clinical practice. However, it remains unclear whether CTS5 or RS would be a more powerful clinical model for recurrence risk evaluation. Therefore, we conducted the present study to compare the performance of CTS5 risk model and RS on different recurrence evaluation. And we further integrated the two models into a novel nomogram to improve the power for prognosis prediction.Female patients with invasive hormone receptor positive breast cancer in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) database with RS data available were included. The clinicopathological data were directly extracted from SEER database. Participants were divided into three subsets according to recurrence timing (<36 months, between 36 and 60 months, and >60 months) for model evaluation. Survival receiver operating characteristic curve and C-index were calculated to evaluate discrimination. Calibration curve were used to visual inspection for calibration. Model comparison was assessed by net reclassification index (NRI) method. Nomogram prognostic model was developed with the combination of CTS5 score and RS and also included other critical clinicopathological parameters.In total, 64044 breast cancer patients were enrolled for analysis. The number of patients with survival <36 months (early recurrence subset), 36-60 months (intermediate recurrence subset) and >60 months (late recurrence subset) were 64044, 36878 and 15926, respectively. For model discrimination, CTS5 model was superior to RS for overall survival (OS) prediction (likelihood ratio test P\u00a0<\u00a00 0.001). RS model showed better performance for breast cancer specific survival (BCSS) in late recurrence subsets and worse performance in early and intermediate recurrence subsets than CTS5 (likelihood ratio test P\u00a0<\u00a00 0.001). For calibration, CTS5 model was superior to RS model for OS, which overestimated the recurrence risk in low-risk subgroup. Both models overestimated the risk for BCSS. In either early/intermediate/late recurrence patient subsets, there was no significant difference in NRI between two models in terms of both BCSS and OS, indicating the two models had comparable prognostic value. The nomogram which combined these two models largely improved the discrimination and calibration power (C-index 0.70-0.72).Our study proved the CTS5 risk model had comparable prognostic value as RS in HR\u00a0+\u00a0breast cancer patients. And the novel nomogram model had better discrimination and calibration than both CTS5 and RS, and future large-scale clinical trials are warranted for further validation.",
  "Women under 40 years old are at increased risk for developing human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive or triple negative subtype and more advanced breast cancer, yet young age itself has also historically been an independent prognostic factor.Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, we examined data for 271,173 women with stage I-III breast cancer between 2010 and 2015. Using Fine and Gray regression models to account for competing risks, we examined the risk of breast cancer-specific death by age and clinical subtypes, considering grade, hormone receptor (HR) and HER2 status, adjusting for demographic, clinical and treatment variables.Of 271,173 women eligible for analysis, 14,109 were <40 years of age. Women under 40 years old were more likely to be non-white, uninsured, and to have higher stage, higher grade, HER2-positive and triple-negative subtype disease (all, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Compared to women ages 40-60, women ages <40 had higher breast cancer mortality (hazard ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6-1.9) in unadjusted analysis. In models controlling for demographic, clinical and treatment factors, young age was significantly associated with an increased risk of breast cancer mortality among women with HR-positive, lower grade disease (hazard ratio 1.7; 95% CI 1.4-2.1) but not for women with high grade/HR-positive, HER2-positive, or triple-negative disease. Women age >75 had increased breast cancer mortality in all subtypes.With modern clinical subtyping, age under 40 remains independently associated with worse outcomes in 30 months follow-up only in HR-positive, lower grade disease.",
  "This study investigated whether the association between family history of breast cancer in first-degree relatives and breast cancer risk varies by breast density.Women aged 40 years and older who underwent screening between 2009 and 2010 were followed up until 2020. Family history was assessed using a self-reported questionnaire. Using Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS), breast density was categorized into dense breast (heterogeneously or extremely dense) and non-dense breast (almost entirely fatty or scattered areas of fibro-glandular). Cox regression model was used to assess the association between family history and breast cancer risk.Of the 4,835,507 women, 79,153 (1.6%) reported having a family history of breast cancer and 77,238 women developed breast cancer. Family history led to an increase in the 5-year cumulative incidence in women with dense- and non-dense breasts. Results from the regression model with and without adjustment for breast density yielded similar HRs in all age groups, suggesting that breast density did not modify the association between family history and breast cancer. After adjusting for breast density and other factors, family history of breast cancer was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in all three age groups (age 40-49 years: aHR 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.85-2.08; age 50-64 years: aHR 1.70, 95% CI 1.58-1.82, and age \u226565 years: aHR 1.95, 95% CI 1.78-2.14).Family history of breast cancer and breast density are independently associated with breast cancer. Both factors should be carefully considered in future risk prediction models of breast cancer.",
  "To examined the impact of reproductive factors on the relationship between radiation treatment (RT) for a first breast cancer and risk of contralateral breast cancer (CBC).The Women's Environmental Cancer and Radiation Epidemiology (WECARE) Study is a multi-center, population-based case-control study where cases are women with asynchronous CBC (N\u00a0=\u00a01521) and controls are women with unilateral breast cancer (N\u00a0=\u00a02211). Rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using conditional logistic regression to assess the independent and joint effects of RT (ever/never and location-specific stray radiation dose to the contralateral breast [0, >0-<1Gy, \u22651Gy]) and reproductive factors (e.g., parity).Nulliparous women treated with RT (\u22651Gy dose) were at increased risk of CBC compared with nulliparous women not treated with RT, although this relationship did not reach statistical significance (RR\u00a0=\u00a01.34, 95% CI 0.87, 2.07). Women treated with RT who had an interval pregnancy (i.e., pregnancy after first diagnosis and before second diagnosis [in cases]/reference date [in controls]) had an increased risk of CBC compared with those who had an interval pregnancy with no RT (RR\u00a0=\u00a04.60, 95% CI 1.16, 18.28). This was most apparent for women with higher radiation doses to the contralateral breast.Among young female survivors of breast cancer, we found some evidence suggesting that having an interval pregnancy could increase a woman's risk of CBC following RT for a first breast cancer. While sampling variability precludes strong interpretations, these findings suggest a role for pregnancy and hormonal factors in radiation-associated CBC.",
  "The effect of changes in mammographic density over time on the risk of breast cancer remains inconclusive.We used information from four centres of the Breast Cancer Screening Program in Spain in the period 1996-2015. We analysed individual level data from 117,388 women first screened age 50-54, with at least two screening examinations. Breast density was determined using the BI-RADS classification (A to D in increasing order) at earliest and latest screening examination. Adjusted Poisson regression models were used to estimate the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) of the association between changes in mammographic density and breast cancer risk over time.During an average 5.8 years of follow-up, 1592 (1.36%) women had a breast cancer diagnosis. An increase in density category increased breast cancer risk, and a decrease in density decreased the risk, compared with women who remained in the same BI-RADS category. Women whose density category increased from B to C or B to D had a RR of 1.55 (95%CI\u202f=\u202f1.24-1.94) and 2.32 (95%CI\u202f=\u202f1.48-3.63), respectively. The RR for women whose density increased from C to D was 1.51 (95%CI\u202f=\u202f1.03-2.22). Changes in BI-RADS density were similarly associated with the risk for invasive cancer than for ductal carcinoma in situ.Although a modest proportion of women changed BI-RADS density category, mammographic density changes modulated the risk of breast cancer and identified women at a differential risk. Using two longitudinal measures of BI-RADS density could help target women for risk-based screening strategies.",
  "The prognostic impact of postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) on high-risk patients with T1-2N0 breast cancer is controversial. We aimed to investigate the effect of PMRT on high-risk patients with T1-2N0 breast cancer.A total of 3439 patients diagnosed with T1-2N0 breast cancer who received mastectomy between 2000 and 2016 in our institute were retrospectively analyzed. Leveraging the Fine and Gray competing risks regression in unirradiated patients, risk factors of locoregional recurrence (LRR) were identified. All patients were stratified into high-risk (3 or 4 risk factors) and low-risk (no more than 2 risk factors) groups. The prognostic effect of PMRT was estimated in two subgroups. This subgroup analysis was also performed in patients with T2N0 breast cancer.The median follow-up was 89 months. The 5-year cumulative incidence of LRR was 2.2% in unirradiated patients. Tumor size, estrogen receptor (ER) status, histologic grade and lymphovascular invasion (LVI) were identified as independent risk factors of LRR. In the high-risk group, PMRT was correlated with a 8.3% risk reduction of 5-year LRR, 7.8% risk reduction of 5-year distant recurrence (DR), and 6.4% risk reduction of 5-year breast cancer mortality (BCM), whereas it was not correlated with LRR, DR, or BCM in low-risk group. In patients with T2N0 breast cancer, PMRT was associated with decreased LRR, DR and BCM in high-risk group, other than low-risk group.PMRT presented heterogenous effect on patients with T1-2N0 breast cancer. Patients at high risk of LRR were more likely to benefit from PMRT.",
  "The burden of breast cancer has grown rapidly in China during recent decades. However, the association between tumor markers (CA15-3, CA125, and CEA) and breast cancer survival among certain molecular subtypes is unclear; we described this association in a large, population-based study.We conducted a cohort study including 10,836 women according to the Tianjin Breast Cancer Cases Cohort. Demographic and epidemiologic data were collected by a structured face-to-face questionnaire. Clinico-pathological parameters were abstracted from medical records, and follow-up information was obtained once a year by telephone. The primary endpoints were breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and disease-free survival (DFS). We utilized the Cox proportional hazard model to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).Among all patients, elevated CA15-3 and CEA exhibited consistently and statistically significant reduced BCSS compared with normal ones (CA15-3: HR\u20091.54, 95% CI 1.01-2.34; CEA: HR\u20092.45, 95% CI 1.40-4.30). Similar patterns of association were observed for DFS (CA15-3: HR\u20092.09, 95% CI 1.44-3.02; CEA: HR\u20092.71, 95% CI 1.71-4.27). Moreover, in luminal A subtype, high CA15-3 and CEA levels were associated with decreased BCSS (CA15-3: HR\u20094.47, 95% CI 2.04-9.81; CEA: HR\u20093.79, 95% CI 1.68-8.55) and DFS (CA15-3: HR\u20094.06, 95% CI 2.29-7.18, CEA: HR\u20093.41, 95% CI 1.75-6.64). In basal-like subtype, elevated CEA conferred reduction for BCSS (HR\u20095.13, 95% CI 1.65-15.9). However, no association was observed between CA125 and breast cancer outcome.Preoperative CA15-3 and CEA levels differ in breast cancer molecular subtypes and yield strong prognostic information in Chinese women with breast cancer. Measuring CA15-3 and CEA levels before surgery may have the potential in predicting breast cancer survival and offering patients' personalized treatment strategy among luminal A and basal-like subtypes.",
  "The benefit of endocrine therapy for patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-low (1%-10%) positive breast cancer is a matter for debate. We aimed to compare the clinical characteristics and survival outcome of ER-low patients with ER-high (\uff1e10%) positive patients and ER-negative patients.From the breast cancer database of our institution, we identified 5466 patients with known ER status who were diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer between January 2008 and December 2016. Variables associated with initiation of endocrine therapy were identified using multivariate logistic regression model. According to ER status, all patients were classified into ER-low (1%-10%), ER-high (>10%) and ER-negative subgroups. Fine and Gray competing risks regression was performed to compare the survival outcome of three subgroups.Age at diagnosis, ER status and progesterone receptor (PR) status were identified as correlates of initiation of endocrine therapy. ER-low patients were more likely to have advanced, PR-negative, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive or grade \u2162 disease compared to ER-high patients. Similar to ER-negative patients, ER-low patients presented increased rate of locoregional recurrence (LRR), distant recurrence (DR) and breast cancer mortality (BCM) than ER-high patients. Endocrine therapy showed nonsignificant trends toward lower LRR, DR and BCM in ER-low patients.Similar to ER-negative patients, ER-low patients had more aggressive clinical characteristics and worse survival outcome than ER-high patients. ER-low patients appeared to benefit less from endocrine therapy. Randomized studies are needed to further explore the endocrine responsiveness of ER-low patients.",
  "The COVID-19 pandemic is a significant worldwide health crisis. Breast cancer patients with COVID-19 are fragile and require particular clinical care. This study aimed to identify the clinical characteristics of breast cancer patients with COVID-19 and the risks associated with anti-cancer treatment.The medical records of breast cancer patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were collected among 9559 COVID-19 patients from seven designated hospitals from 13th January to 18th March 2020 in Hubei, China. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess risk factors for COVID-19 severity.Of the 45 breast cancer patients with COVID-19, 33 (73.3%) developed non-severe COVID-19, while 12 (26.7%) developed severe COVID-19, of which 3 (6.7%) patients died. The median age was 62 years, and 3 (6.7%) patients had stage IV breast cancer. Univariate analysis showed that age over 75 and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score were associated with COVID-19 disease severity (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Multivariate analysis showed that patients who received chemotherapy within 7 days had a significantly higher risk for severe COVID-19 (logistic regression model: RR\u00a0=\u00a013.886, 95% CI 1.014-190.243, P\u00a0=\u00a00.049; Cox proportional hazards model: HR\u00a0=\u00a013.909, 95% CI 1.086-178.150, P\u00a0=\u00a00.043), with more pronounced neutropenia and higher LDH, CRP and procalcitonin levels than other patients (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).In our breast cancer cohort, the severity of COVID-19 could be associated with baseline factors such as age over 75 and ECOG scores. Chemotherapy within 7 days before symptom onset could be a risk factor for severe COVID-19, reflected by neutropenia and elevated LDH, CRP and procalcitonin levels.",
  "Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and is rated among one of the three common malignancies worldwide in combination with colon and lung cancer. The escalating mortality rate of breast cancer patients has captivated the attention of the present-day researchers to come up with new management options. According to WHO, early detection, timely diagnosis and comprehensive breast cancer management are the three cornerstones for controlling breast cancer incidences per year. Multidisciplinary theragnostic approaches for simultaneous diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer have further enriched the therapeutic arsenal. Imaging and biopsy play a significant role in the diagnosis of breast cancer. The treatment plan mostly initiates with general surgery or radiation therapy followed up with adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant therapy. Conventional chemotherapeutics in breast cancer suffer from toxicity and lack of site specificity. Bio-safe gold nanoparticles hold sufficient promise for bridging this gap. Diverse phytochemicals-based synthesis routes to arrive at nano-dimensional gold with spotlight on reaction mechanisms, reaction variables, specific advantages, toxicity and their influence in breast cancer conditions are the focus of this work. This review marks the first attempt to explore the potential of phytochemical-derived nano-gold in breast cancer treatment.",
  "The aim of this study was to establish individualized nomograms to predict survival outcomes in older female patients with stage IV breast cancer who did or did not undergo local surgery, and to determine which patients could benefit from surgery.A total of 3,129 female patients with stage IV breast cancer aged \u226570 years between 2010 and 2015 were included in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS). Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier plot and log-rank test. Nomograms and risk stratification models were constructed.Patients who underwent surgery had better OS (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.751, 95% CI [0.668-0.843], P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and BCSS (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.713, 95% CI [0.627-0.810], P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) than patients who did not undergo surgery. Patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive, lung or liver metastases may not benefit from surgery. In the stratification model, low-risk patients benefited from surgery (OS, HR\u00a0=\u00a00.688, 95% CI [0.568-0.833], P\u00a0<\u00a00.001; BCSS, HR\u00a0=\u00a00.632, 95% CI [0.509-0.784], P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), while patients in the high-risk group had similar outcomes (OS, HR\u00a0=\u00a00.920, 95% CI [0.709-1.193], P\u00a0=\u00a00.509; BCSS, HR\u00a0=\u00a00.953, 95% CI [0.713-1.275], P\u00a0=\u00a00.737).Older female patients with stage IV breast cancer who underwent surgery had better OS and BCSS than those who did not in each specific subgroup. Patients in low- or intermediate-risk group benefit from surgery while those in the high-risk group do not.",
  "In this study, we evaluated the incidence and outcomes of pregnancy after breast cancer was diagnosed in women of childbearing age. Additionally, we evaluated the prognosis of patients who became pregnant after breast cancer, according to the treatment.This was a retrospective cohort study of women aged 20-45 years who were surgically treated for breast cancer between 2004 and 2014 using the Korean National Health Insurance database. The patients were classified into six groups according to the treatment. Propensity score matching was applied to the cohort to analyze the risk of breast cancer-associated mortality after pregnancy and childbirth.Of the 45,765 patients who had been newly diagnosed with breast cancer, 1826 (4%) became pregnant after breast cancer diagnosis. Among the pregnant group, the HR of the risk of death was 0.15 (95% CI, 0.06 to 0.36) for patients who became pregnant \u226549 months after the diagnosis. In patients who received endocrine therapy and chemotherapy, the pregnant group had better prognosis than the non-pregnant group. There was no significant difference between the pregnant group and the non-pregnant group in patients who received chemotherapy and trastuzumab with or without endocrine therapy.The risk of death was low in women who became pregnant \u226549 months after the diagnosis of breast cancer. The prognosis of pregnant women was non-inferior to that of non-pregnant women, even in women who received trastuzumab. These findings provide reassurance to patients with HER2-positive cancer who are considering future pregnancy.",
  "Compare overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) outcomes of breast conservative therapy (BCT) and mastectomy in a large cohort of patients with early-stage triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), using a propensity score-based matching approach.Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was used to study the role of RT in early stage TNBC. Primary end points were OS and BCSS. Cox proportional hazard regression models and Kaplan-Meier plots were used to generate the desired outcomes. Propensity score matching was done to minimize bias.12,761 patients with T1-2N0M0 TNBC as their first malignancy were retrieved. Of these 7237 had lumpectomy with RT, and 5524 had mastectomy only. Age, race, marital status, tumor laterality, grade and stage, and receipt of chemotherapy were prognostic variables for OS and BCSS. Among 4848 matched subjects, the 5-year OS was significantly higher in patients with lumpectomy and RT (89%) compared to mastectomy alone (84.5%) (p-value <0.001). Similarly, BCSS was significantly higher in patients with lumpectomy and RT (93%) compared to mastectomy alone (91%) (p-value <0.001). On subgroup analysis, patients who are younger than 40 had similar survival outcomes after either mastectomy alone or lumpectomy with RT. However, those who are older than 60, have any grade or T stage had better survival outcomes with lumpectomy and RT.Overall, lumpectomy followed by RT is associated with better OS and BCSS compared to mastectomy in T1-2N0M0 TNBC patients. Further research is needed to determine the optimal treatment strategy for specific patient subgroups.",
  "We aimed to assess differences in breast cancer risk across benign breast disease diagnosed at prevalent or incident screens.We conducted a retrospective cohort study with data from 629,087 women participating in a long-standing population-based breast cancer screening program in Spain. Each benign breast disease was classified as non-proliferative, proliferative without atypia, or proliferative with atypia, and whether it was diagnosed in a prevalent or incident screen. We used partly conditional Cox hazard regression to estimate the adjusted hazard ratios of the risk of breast cancer.Compared with women without benign breast disease, the risk of breast cancer was significantly higher (p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.005) in women with benign breast disease diagnosed in an incident screen (aHR, 2.67; 95%CI: 2.24-3.19) than in those with benign breast disease diagnosed in a prevalent screen (aHR, 1.87; 95%CI: 1.57-2.24). The highest risk was found in women with a proliferative benign breast disease with atypia (aHR, 4.35; 95%CI: 2.09-9.08, and 3.35; 95%CI: 1.51-7.40 for those diagnosed at incident and prevalent screens, respectively), while the lowest was found in women with non-proliferative benign breast disease (aHR, 2.39; 95%CI: 1.95-2.93, and 1.63; 95%CI: 1.32-2.02 for those diagnosed at incident and prevalent screens, respectively).Our study showed that the risk of breast cancer conferred by a benign breast disease differed according to type of screen (prevalent or incident). To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyse the impact of the screening type on benign breast disease prognosis.",
  "We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the screening performance of synthesized mammography (SM) plus digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) with digital mammography (DM) plus DBT or DM alone.Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched from January 2010 to January 2021. Eligible population-based studies on breast cancer screening comparing SM/DBT with DM/DBT or DM in asymptomatic women were included. A random-effect model was used in this meta-analysis. Data were summarized as risk differences (RDs), with 95\u00a0% confidence intervals (CIs).Thirteen studies involving 1,370,670 participants were included. Compared with DM/DBT, screening using SM/DBT had similar breast cancer detection rate (CDR) (RD\u00a0=\u00a0-0.1/1000 screens, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a0-0.4 to 0.2, p\u00a0=\u00a00.557, I<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00\u00a0%), but lower recall rate (RD\u00a0=\u00a0-0.56\u00a0%, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a0-1.03 to\u00a0-0.08, p\u00a0=\u00a00.022, I<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a090\u00a0%) and lower biopsy rate (RD\u00a0=\u00a0-0.33\u00a0%, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a0-0.56 to\u00a0-0.10, p\u00a0=\u00a00.005, I<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a078\u00a0%). Compared with DM, SM/DBT improved CDR (RD\u00a0=\u00a02.0/1000 screens, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.4 to 2.6, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, I<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a063\u00a0%) and reduced recall rate (RD\u00a0=\u00a0-0.95\u00a0%, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a0-1.91 to\u00a0-0.002, p\u00a0=\u00a00.049, I<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a099\u00a0%). However, SM/DBT and DM had similar interval cancer rate (ICR) (RD\u00a0=\u00a00.1/1000 screens, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a0-0.6 to 0.8, p\u00a0=\u00a00.836, I<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a071\u00a0%) and biopsy rate (RD\u00a0=\u00a0-0.05\u00a0%, 95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a0-0.35 to 0.24, p\u00a0=\u00a00.727, I<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a093\u00a0%).Screening using SM/DBT has similar breast cancer detection but reduces recall and biopsy when compared with DM/DBT. SM/DBT improves CDR when compared with DM, but they have little difference in ICR. SM/DBT could replace DM/DBT in breast cancer screening to reduce radiation dose.",
  "To evaluate the readability, understandability, and actionability of online patient education materials (OPEM) related to breast cancer risk assessment.We queried seven English-language search terms related to breast cancer risk assessment: breast cancer high-risk, breast cancer risk factors, breast cancer family history, BRCA, breast cancer risk assessment, Tyrer-Cuzick, and Gail model. Websites were categorized as: academic/hospital-based, commercial, government, non-profit or academic based on the organization hosting the site. Grade-level readability of qualifying websites and categories was determined using readability metrics and generalized estimating equations based on written content only. Readability scores were compared to the recommended parameters set by the American Medical Association (AMA). Understandability and actionability of OPEM related to breast cancer high-risk were evaluated using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT) and compared to criteria set at \u226570%. Descriptive statistics and inter-rater reliability analysis were utilized.343 websites were identified, of which 162 met study inclusion criteria. The average grade readability score was 12.1 across all websites (range 10.8-13.4). No website met the AMA recommendation. Commercial websites demonstrated the highest overall average readability of 13.1. Of the 26 websites related to the search term breast cancer high-risk, the average understandability and actionability scores were 62% and 34% respectively, both below criteria.OPEM on breast cancer risk assessment available to the general public do not meet criteria for readability, understandability, or actionability. To ensure patient comprehension of medical information online, future information should be published in simpler, more appropriate terms.",
  "Epidemiological studies have shown that the risk of secondary malignancies may increase by radiotherapy. Lung cancer is the most important long-term complication of breast cancer radiotherapy.Major electronic databases including Scopus, Web of Science, and MEDLINE were searched. All cohort studies that investigated the association between radiotherapy for breast cancer and risk of primary lung, bronchus, and trachea cancers conducted until March 2021 were included. The study participants were evaluated regardless of their age and ethnicity. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the quality of the studies. The designated effects were risk ratio (RR). The random-effects model was used to estimate the average effects.Fifteen studies including 1,640,247 women with primary breast cancer were identified of which 937,151 had not received radiotherapy and 703,096 subjects had received radiotherapy. In general, there was no significant association between breast cancer radiotherapy and lung cancer based on 10 studies (RR\u2009=\u20090.95, 95% CI 0.87-1.02, P\u2009=\u20090.15), There was no association between breast cancer radiotherapy and lung, bronchus, and trachea cancers either based on 5 studies (RR\u2009=\u20090.98, 95% CI 0.93-1.02, P\u2009=\u20090.32).Radiotherapy for breast cancer is not associated with an excess risk of lung cancer. Due to the limited number of studies, lack of data regarding smoking status, and substantial variation in exposure of the lungs in breast cancer radiotherapy worldwide, further investigations based on randomized controlled trials are suggested to address the potential risk of lung cancer after breast cancer radiotherapy.",
  "A previous study found evidence that a breast cancer risk prediction model preferentially selected for less aggressive tumors in Swedish women. In the US, the Gail model has been widely used and was used for entry criteria in two large breast cancer prevention trials. We assessed if higher risk levels from the Gail model were associated with less aggressive tumor characteristics and if risk levels were predictive of mortality and survival.We used questionnaire data from women in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial to calculate Gail risk levels (low <\u20091.66%; moderate 1.66-2.99%; high \u2265\u20093.00%). Women aged 55-74 were enrolled between 1993 and 2001 and had detailed information on breast cancer incidence and tumors collected. We calculated breast cancer incidence and mortality rates among all women by risk levels and examined breast cancer survival and tumor characteristics among women diagnosed with breast cancer. We used Chi-squared tests and multivariable logistic regression to assess the association between risk levels and tumor characteristics.The study population for this analysis included 45,402 women with 1908 cases of breast cancer. Women at high risk were associated with higher risk of breast cancer mortality compared to women with low risk [rate ratio (RR) =\u20092.29 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37-3.84)]. Higher risk levels were associated with lobular-type tumors [moderate: adjusted odds ratio (aOR) =\u20091.57 95% CI 1.13-2.17; high: aOR\u2009=\u20091.78 95% CI 1.25-2.54] but were not associated with any other tumor characteristics or breast cancer survival.We did not find evidence that higher risk levels from the Gail model are predictive of less aggressive breast cancer tumors.",
  "Previous studies revealed that patients with early-stage metaplastic breast cancer (MBC) underwent mastectomy more often than breast-conserving therapy (BCT) mainly due to the larger tumor size. This study was performed to compare the survival outcomes following BCT versus mastectomy for patients with early-stage MBC.Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was used to identify women diagnosed with early-stage MBC (T1-3N0-3M0) between 2001 and 2016, who were treated with either BCT or mastectomy. We assessed overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) using the Kaplan-Meier method and hazard ratios using Cox proportional hazards models.A total of 2412 MBC patients were identified, 881 (36.5%) of whom underwent BCT and 1531(63.5%) underwent mastectomy. The median follow-up time was 73 months. Most of patients had older age (\u226550 years old), larger tumor size, higher American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage and hormone receptor negativity. After adjustment for confounding variables, patients who underwent BCT had significantly improved OS (5-year OS: 84.3% vs 62.5%; 10-year OS: 73.0% vs 52.1%; adjusted HR\u00a0=\u00a00.76, 95%CI: 0.59-0.97, p\u00a0=\u00a00.028) and BCSS (5-year BCSS: 89.1% vs 70.8%; 10-year BCSS: 83.9% vs 67.5%; adjusted HR\u00a0=\u00a00.72, 95%CI: 0.53-0.96, p\u00a0=\u00a00.026) than those who underwent mastectomy, and this improvement remained significant for all T and N stages of MBC except for N2-3 stage.BCT conferred improved OS and BCSS compared with mastectomy for patients with early-stage MBC, and the improvement persisted in almost all of the subgroups of different T and N stages.",
  "This study aimed to investigate the role of postoperative radiation therapy in a large population-based cohort of patients with stage I-III male breast cancer (MaBC).Patients with stage I-III breast cancer treated with surgery were selected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer database from 2010 to 2015. Multivariate logistic regression identified the predictors of radiation therapy administration. Multivariate Cox regression model was used to evaluate the predictors of survival.We identified 1321 patients. Age, stage, positive regional nodes, surgical procedure, and HER2 status were strong predictors of radiation therapy administration. There was no difference between patients who received radiation therapy and those who did not (P\u202f=\u202f0.46); however, after propensity score matching, it was associated with improved OS (P\u202f=\u202f0.04). In the multivariate analysis of the unmatched cohort, the factors associated with better OS were administration of radiation therapy and chemotherapy. In the subset analysis of the unmatched cohort, postoperative radiation therapy was associated with improved OS in men undergoing breast-conserving surgery (BCS), with four or more node-positive or larger primary tumours (T3/T4). Furthermore, we found no benefit of radiation therapy, regardless of the type of axillary surgery in mastectomy (MS). In older MaBC patients with T1-2N1 who underwent MS, radiation therapy showed no significant effects, regardless of chemotherapy.Postoperative radiation therapy could improve the survival of MaBC patients undergoing BCS, with four or more node-positive or larger primary tumours. Moreover, it should be carefully considered in patients undergoing MS and older T1-2N1 patients.",
  "Studies in the adjuvant setting have shown that endocrine therapy related side effects predict breast cancer recurrence risk. Here, we assess the relationship between early reported side effects and incidence of breast cancer in women randomised to tamoxifen for cancer prevention in the International Breast Intervention Study (IBIS)-I trial.Women randomised to tamoxifen in the IBIS-I trial and for whom side effect status was known at the 6-month follow-up visit were included in this analysis. Side effects included in this analysis were hot flushes, vaginal discharge, and vaginal dryness. The primary endpoint was all breast cancer and secondary endpoint was oestrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer. Cox proportional hazard models were used to investigate breast cancer incidence in the tamoxifen group with and without side effects reported within 6 months of randomisation.Women randomised to tamoxifen and reporting hot flushes at the 6-month follow-up visit had a non-statistically significant increase in breast cancer compared to those without hot flushes (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.26 (0.98-1.62), P\u00a0=\u00a00.08). A significant higher breast cancer risk was observed for postmenopausal women who reported hot flushes at the 6-month follow-up visit compared to those without hot flushes (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.59 (1.12-2.26), P\u00a0=\u00a00.01). A higher risk was observed for ER-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.81 (1.19-2.74), P\u00a0=\u00a00.01). No significant associations between gynaecological side effects and breast cancer occurrence was observed.Overall, no association between side effects reported at 6 months and subsequent breast cancer occurrence was observed. Some side effects might be useful markers for breast cancer occurrence in postmenopausal women.",
  "Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is an uncommon, but aggressive form of breast cancer that accounts for a disproportionally high fraction of breast cancer related mortality. The aim of this study was to explore the peripheral immune response and the prognostic value of blood-based biomarkers, such as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), in a large IBC cohort.We retrospectively identified 127 IBC patients and collected lab results from in-hospital medical records. The differential count of leukocytes was determined at the moment of diagnosis, before any therapeutic intervention. A cohort of early stage (n\u00a0=\u00a0108), locally advanced (n\u00a0=\u00a074) and metastatic breast cancer patients (n\u00a0=\u00a041) served as a control population.The NLR was significantly higher in IBC compared to an early stage breast cancer cohort, but no difference between IBC patients and locally advanced breast cancer patients was noted. In the metastatic setting, there was also no significant difference between IBC and nIBC. However, a high NLR (>4.0) remained a significant predictor of worse outcome in IBC patients (HR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.24-1.00; P\u00a0=\u00a0.05) and a lower platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) (\u2264210) correlated with a better disease-free survival (DFS) (HR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.28-0.93; P\u00a0=\u00a0.03).Patients with a high NLR (>4.0) have a worse overall prognosis in IBC, while the PLR correlated with relapse free survival (RFS). Since NLR and PLR were not specifically associated with IBC disease, they can be seen as markers of more extensive disease.",
  "Because a number of years may be required for normal cells to develop into carcinoma, genes involved in tumorigenesis and progression might differ among breast cancers in young women and those in older women. The present study sought to analyze subclonality during breast cancer evolution as well as diversity within each individual in our young patients' cohort.A total of 13 women aged <35 years at diagnosis with early breast cancer were recruited. Serial sections of breast samples consisting of synchronous invasive carcinoma, adjacent ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), normal breast tissue, and metastatic lymph nodes were collected and prepared for immunohistochemical analysis of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER2, and Ki67, and for extraction of genomic DNA. Germline and somatic gene alterations of genomic DNA were examined by targeted sequencing.Genomic DNA from 13 blood samples and 36 breast tissues consisting of 14 invasive carcinomas, nine adjacent DCIS, 11 normal breast tissues, and two metastatic lymph nodes were successfully sequenced. Germline gene alterations including pathogenic variants and gene alterations that were not yet evaluated for their clinical significance were detected in all patients but one. Somatic gene alterations were identified in eight invasive carcinomas, five DCIS, and one metastatic lymph node. Different somatic gene alterations between invasive carcinoma and DCIS were detected in two patients. Somatic gene mutations were present in non-neoplastic tissues in three patients. No two patients had the same gene alterations.Our results reveal diversity within each individual during breast cancer progression.",
  "The aim of this study was to analyze the association of molecular subtype concordance and disease outcome in patients with synchronous bilateral breast cancer (SBBC) and metachronous breast cancer (MBBC).Patients diagnosed with SBBC or MBBC in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database or Comprehensive Breast Health Center (CBHC) Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai were retrospectively reviewed and included. Clinicopathologic features, molecular subtype status concordance, and prognosis were compared in patients with SBBC and MBBC. Other prognostic factors for breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and overall survival (OS) were also identified for bilateral breast cancer patients.Totally, 3395 and 115 patients were included from the SEER and Ruijin CBHC cohorts. Molecular subtype concordance rate was higher in the SBBC group compared to MBBC in both SEER cohort (75.8% vs 57.7%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and Ruijin CBHC cohort (76.2% vs 45.2%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). Survival analyses indicated that SBBC was related to worse BCSS than MBBC (p\u00a0=\u00a00.015). Molecular subtype discordance was related to worse BCSS (hazard ratio (HR), 1.64, 95% confidential interval (CI), 1.18-2.27, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and OS (HR, 1.59, 95% CI, 1.24-2.04, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in the SBBC group, but not for the MBBC group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.650 for BCSS, p\u00a0=\u00a00.669 for OS).Molecular subtype concordance rate was higher in the SBBC group than MBBC group. Patients with discordant molecular subtype was associated with worse disease outcome in the SBBC patients, but not in MBBC, which deserves further clinical evaluation.",
  "The Japanese Breast Cancer Society (JBCS) registry began data collection in 1975, and it was integrated into National Clinical Database in 2012. As of 2016, the JBCS registry contains records of 656,896 breast cancer patients from more than 1400 hospitals throughout Japan. In the 2016 registration, the number of institutes involved was 1422, and the total number of patients was 95,870. We herein present the summary of the annual data of the JBCS registry collected in 2016. We analyzed the demographic and clinicopathologic characteristics of registered breast cancer patients from various angles. Especially, we examined the registrations on family history, menstruation, onset age, body mass index according to age, nodal status based on tumor size and subtype, and proportion based on ER, PgR, and HER2 status. This report based on the JBCS registry would support clinical management for breast cancer patients and clinical study in the near future.",
  "Mammography (MG) is widely used for screening examinations. Dense breast reduces MG screening sensitivity, possibly delaying diagnosis. However, little is known about the characteristics of breast cancers without MG findings indicative of malignancy. Hence, we investigated breast cancer patients with tumors not detected by MG.In total, 1758 Japanese patients with breast cancer, undergoing curative surgery between 2012 and 2018 without neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, were retrospectively investigated. Clinicopathological features were compared between patients without (MG-negative) and with (MG-positive) cancer-specific findings on MG. The current study included cases who came to our hospital after experiencing subjective symptoms, or whose tumors were detected by MG and/or US-screening. We reviewed results of both MG and US conducted at our institution.There were 201\u00a0MG-negative cases (11.4%). In patients with invasive disease, multivariate analysis revealed MG-negative patients to have higher breast density on MG (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Tumors of MG-negative patients were smaller (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), showed less lymph node involvement (p\u00a0=\u00a00.011), and were of lower grade (p\u00a0=\u00a00.027). The majority of MG-negative tumors were found by ultrasound screening, being smaller than tumors in patients with subjective symptoms. In the MG-negative group, tumor characteristics such as tumor grade did not differ between those detected by screening versus subjective symptoms.Most tumors in MG-negative group patients were identified by US screening and the diseases were found at early stages with low malignancy. The usefulness of additional ultrasound with MG-screening might merit further investigations.",
  "CanAssist Breast (CAB), a prognostic test uses immunohistochemistry (IHC) approach coupled with artificial intelligence-based machine learning algorithm for prognosis of early-stage hormone-receptor positive, HER2/neu negative breast cancer patients. It was developed and validated in an Indian cohort. Here we report the first blinded validation of CAB in a multi-country European patient cohort. FFPE tumor samples from 864 patients were obtained from-Spain, Italy, Austria, and Germany. IHC was performed on these samples, followed by recurrence risk score prediction. The outcomes were obtained from medical records. The performance of CAB was analyzed by hazard ratios (HR) and Kaplan Meier curves. CAB stratified European cohort (n\u00a0=\u00a0864) into distinct low- and high-risk groups for recurrence (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) with HR of 3.32 (1.85-5.93) like that of mixed (India, USA, and Europe) (n\u00a0=\u00a01974), 3.43 (2.34-4.93) and Indian cohort (n\u00a0=\u00a0925), 3.09 (1.83-5.21). CAB provided significant prognostic information (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) in women aged \u2264 50 (HR: 4.42 (1.58-12.3), P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and >50 years (HR: 2.93 (1.44-5.96), P\u00a0=\u00a00.0002). CAB had an HR of 2.57 (1.26-5.26), P\u00a0=\u00a00.01) in women with N1 disease. CAB stratified significantly higher proportions (77%) as low-risk over IHC4 (55%) (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Additionally, 82% of IHC4 intermediate-risk patients were stratified as low-risk by CAB. Accurate risk stratification of European patients by CAB coupled with its similar performance inIndian patients shows that CAB is robust and functions independent of ethnic differences. CAB can potentially prevent overtreatment in a greater number of patients compared to IHC4 demonstrating its usefulness for adjuvant systemic therapy planning in European breast cancer patients.",
  "To investigate the mechanism of miR-485-5p inhibiting breast cancer cells by targeting MUC1.Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in breast cancer tissues were analyzed using breast cancer tissue microarrays (TMA) in the GEO database. Differential expression of MUC1 in breast cancer tissue samples was detected by TCGA database. qRT-PCR was used to detect the expression of MUC1 and miR-485-5p in human normal breast epithelial cell lines and human breast cancer cell lines. Bioinformatics was applied to analyze targeted binding site of miR-485-5p and MUC1 and their targeted relationship was identified by dual luciferase assay. The proliferation ability of breast cancer cells was detected by CCK-8 assay. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. The ability of cell migration was measured by scratch healing test. Transwell assay was used to detect the invasion ability of cells. The protein expression levels of MUC1 and EMT-related molecules (E-cadherin, N-cadherin and Vimentin) were detected by Western blot.MUC1 was highly expressed in breast cancer tissue samples and breast cancer cell lines, while miR-485-5p was lowly expressed. Overexpression of miR-485-5p inhibits cell viability and invasion and migration of breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and promotes apoptosis. The same results were obtained by silencing the expression of MUC1. MiR-485-5p targets to bind to the 3'-UTR region of MUC1 and negatively regulates the expression of MUC1. Overexpressing MUC1 while overexpressing miR-485-5p reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-485-5p on breast cancer and inhibited EMT.MiR-485-5p can down-regulate the expression of MUC1, thus inhibit the proliferation, invasion and migration of breast cancer cells and promote cell apoptosis.",
  "Metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) is associated with an aggressive disease course, and limited treatment options. The recent accelerated drug development in the space of mTNBC has been driven by a precision-medicine approach, with the potential to deliver more personalized treatments and result in better outcomes. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have introduced a novel paradigm in the space of mTNBC, leading to the approval of the first targeted agent in this setting. The research and development of ADCs comes in parallel with the identification of tumor-specific targets of pharmacological interest. As a result, ADCs bring the potential for agnostic treatment delivery-across multiple histology types, and theranostically, by coupling tumor-antigen identification and treatment, as a continuum. In this perspective, recent progress in ADCs development for early and mTNBC are outlined, in the trade-off of patient selection, tumor specificity, precise drug delivery, potent payloads safety and quality of life.",
  "Women with hereditary breast cancer are at increased risk of second primary cancers in the ipsilateral and contralateral breast. The level of risk varies with mutation and age at first breast cancer diagnosis. These factors as well as life expectancy should be considered when selecting the surgical approach.",
  "Though BRCA1 mutation is the most susceptible factor of breast cancer, its prognostic value is disputable. Here in this study, we use a novel method which based on whole-genome analysis to evaluate the chromosome instability (CIN) value and identified the potential relationship between CIN and prognosis of breast cancer patients with germline-BRCA1 mutation.Sanger sequencing or a 98-gene panel sequencing assay was used to screen for BRCA1 germline small mutations in 1151 breast cancer patients with high-risk factors. MLPA assay was employed to screen BRCA1 large genomic rearrangements in familial breast cancer patients with BRCA1 negative for small mutations. Thirty-two samples with unique BRCA1 germline mutation patterns were further subjected to CIN evaluation by LPWGS (low-pass whole-genome sequencing) technology.Firstly, 113 patients with germline BRCA1 mutations were screened from the cohort. Further CIN analysis by the LPWGS assay indicated that CIN was independent from the mutation location or type of BRCA1. Patients with high CIN status had shorter disease-free survival rates (DFS) (HR\u2009=\u20096.54, 95% CI 1.30-32.98, P\u2009=\u20090.034). The TP53 copy loss was also characterized by LPWGS assay. The rates of TP53 copy loss in CIN high and CIN low groups were 85.71% (12/14) and 16.67% (3/18), respectively.CIN-high is a prognostic factor correlated with shorter DFS and was independent with the germline BRCA1 mutation pattern. Higher CIN values were significantly correlated with TP53 copy loss in breast cancer patients with germline BRCA1 mutation. Our results revealed a reliable molecular parameter for distinguishing patients with poor prognosis from the BRCA1-mutated breast cancer patients.",
  "Our aim was to determine whether breast cancer survivors are at increased risk of obstetric and maternal complications at time of delivery.The USA 'National Inpatient Sample' database was queried for hospitalizations associated with deliveries, between 2015 and 2018. The incidence of maternal and fetal complications was compared between women with, and without, a personal history of breast cancer.Of the 2,103,216 birth related admissions, 617 (0.03%) of the women were breast cancer survivors, with the proportion increasing over time (from 0.02% in 2015 to 0.04% in 2018). Breast cancer survivors had a higher socioeconomic status (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and were significantly older compared to other mothers (34 vs. 28 years, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Additionally, they were more likely to suffer from preexisting chronic diseases including cardiopulmonary disease and diabetes mellitus, and had a higher incidence of multiple gestation (4.4% vs. 1.6%) [OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.9-4.0, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001]. The incidence of acute adverse events at time of delivery including fetal distress, preterm labor, cesarean section and maternal infection was higher amongst the breast cancer survivors. On multivariate analysis age, ethnic group, comorbidities, multiple gestations, and a previous breast cancer diagnosis, but not cancer treatment, were associated with an increased risk of an obstetric adverse event.Breast cancer survivors have more comorbidities and are at increased risk of acute obstetrical complications at time of delivery. Further studies are required to validate these findings, and evaluate the ability of interventions to improve obstetrical outcomes amongst breast cancer survivors.",
  "Although Ki67 has important clinical relevance in breast cancer, its assessment results vary according to assay due to differences in both analytical and interpretation processes. We aimed to validate the performance of anti-Ki67 antibody clone 30-9 by comparison with clone MIB-1 and to investigate utility of the image analysis system in Ki67 assessment using clinical breast cancer samples.A series of sequential tissue sections was prepared from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks of surgically resected breast cancer specimens from 50 patients. The tissue sections were stained immunohistochemically with anti-Ki67 antibodies, 30-9 and MIB-1, as well as with hematoxylin and eosin for morphological analysis. We scanned all the stained slides with Ventana iScan HT and selected the Ki67 counting areas based on morphological findings. Three pathologists independently studied images of the counting areas to determine Ki67-positive rates. In addition, the images of 30-9-stained slides were analyzed using the image analysis system, VENTANA Virtuoso.Ki67-positive rates by 30-9 showed a strong correlation with those by MIB-1 for all pathologists (pathologist #1: r\u2009=\u20090.985, pathologist #2: r\u2009=\u20090.987, pathologist #3: r\u2009=\u20090.982). Between 30-9 and MIB-1, there was no significant difference of CV%, showing variabilities of Ki67-positive rates among pathologists. Ki67-positive rates showed a strong correlation between the image analytical values and the pathologist-counted median values (r\u2009=\u20090.952).The performance of 30-9 is equivalent to that of MIB-1 in Ki67 assessment of breast cancer. The image analysis system can substitute for or support visual counting by a pathologist.",
  "Clinical Treatment Score post-5\u00a0years (CTS5) is a promising prognostic tool to evaluate late distant recurrence (DR) risk for breast cancer after 5-year adjuvant endocrine therapy.Among 560 postmenopausal women with pathological stage I-III estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) primary breast cancer, 383 women who had received 5-year adjuvant endocrine therapy without any recurrence at 5\u00a0years after surgery were included in this study. The CTS5 was calculated for each patient using a previously published formula, and the patients were stratified by their CTS5 values into the low-, intermediate- and high-CTS5 risk groups.According to the CTS5, 205 (53.5%), 106 (27.7%) and 72 (18.8%) patients were classified into the low-, intermediate-, and high-CTS5 risk groups, respectively. A higher ER expression level was significantly associated with the low CTS5. The increased administration of adjuvant chemotherapy was significantly associated with a high CTS5. The occurrence of DR was higher in the intermediate and high CTS5 groups than in the low CTS5 group. The DRFS in the low CTS5 risk group was significantly better than that in the intermediate- or high-risk groups. In the ER-high or HER2-negative (HER2-) group, the DRFS in the low-risk group was significantly better than that of the intermediate- or high-risk groups. However, in the low-ER or HER2-positive group, there was no significant difference in DRFS among the three risk groups.In postmenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer, low CTS5 was considered to be associated with a very low risk of late DR. Thus, extended endocrine therapy may be unnecessary for patients with low CTS5 scores. Extended endocrine therapy should be offered for patients with intermediate or high CTS5 scores, especially those with high-ER and HER2- breast cancer.",
  "Increased implementation of proven prevention strategies is required to combat rising breast cancer incidence. We assessed use of risk reducing medication (RRMed) by Australian women at elevated breast cancer risk. Only 2.4% had ever used RRMed. Higher breast cancer risk was statistically significantly associated with use of RRMed (OR 1.82, 95%CI: 1.08-3.07, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02 for \u226530% lifetime risk compared with 16%-29% lifetime risk), but parity, education level and family history of breast cancer were not. Breast cancer prevention medications are underutilised. Efforts are needed to incorporate breast cancer risk assessment and risk management discussions into routine health assessments for women.",
  "Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women in the world. Different therapeutic strategies such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery have been used either individually or in combination. Oncolytic virotherapy is a rising treatment methodology, which utilizes replicating viruses to eliminate tumor cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the oncolytic activity of live-attenuated poliovirus in breast cancer cell lines.The CD155 expression level in two human breast cancer cell lines and a normal breast cell line were evaluated using real-time PCR and flow cytometry. Virus titration was assessed by TCID50. The cytotoxicity of poliovirus on cell line and apoptosis response was investigated by MTT and Caspase 8 and Caspase 9 ELISA kits, respectively.This study showed that CD155 gene was expressed significantly (p\u2009=\u20090.001) higher in both human breast cancer cell lines compared to the normal cell line. The protein expression level of CD155 was 98.1%, 96.7%, in MDA_MB231 and MCF_7 cell lines, respectively, whereas the CD155 expression level was 1.3% in MCF_10A. The cytopathic effect of poliovirus in breast cancer cell lines was significantly higher than normal cells (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Extrinsic apoptosis response was more effective than intrinsic apoptosis in both breast cancer cell lines (p\u2009<\u20090.05).In summary, administration of live-attenuated poliovirus can be a promising treatment to breast cancer. However, in vitro and in vivo studies will be required to evaluate the safety of this strategy.",
  "To determine the diagnostic parameters of breast ultrasound (US) in the setting of routine radiological surveillance after a diagnosis of breast cancer and evaluate costs of the inclusion of breast US as well as any survival benefit of US detected cases of recurrence in surveillance.622 patients underwent breast cancer surgery and follow up at Austin Health from July 2009 to December 2015. Retrospective data analysis was performed to determine; diagnostic parameters, financial costs of US and survival outcomes of US detected cases of recurrence.Patients underwent 1-9 years of breast cancer surveillance, with a median of 4.24 years. 390 (62.7%) patients underwent additional breast US surveillance to mammography. 232 (38.3%) fit criteria for use of additional breast US. 199 abnormal imaging episodes occurred, leading to 16 screen detected-cases of locoregional recurrence. US alone generated 107 abnormal images and found 9 cancers. US had a sensitivity of 44.1%, specificity of 95.2% and positive predictive value of 11.7% in comparison to mammography; 20.6%, 97.4% and 9.9% respectively. US had a biopsy rate of 4.0% and lead to an incremental cancer detection rate of 0.38%. The cost of incremental cancer found was $31,463.72 AUD. Survival outcomes based on method of detection of recurrence were insignificant (p value\u00a0=\u00a00.71).Breast US has a sensitivity of 44.1% and detected seven recurrences that were mammographically occult. Breast US has a similar PPV to mammography in surveillance. Breast US generated considerable biopsy rates and costs. Survival analysis was not able to detect any benefit of US detected cases of recurrence.",
  "The goal was to assess the survival of HIV+ women and HIV- women for breast cancer at a referral center for cancer treatment in Brazil.A retrospective cohort study was performed. A total of 136 women patients with breast cancer were included, being 36 HIV+ women and 100 HIV- women. Controls (HIV-) were selected according to HIV status, matched by date of cancer diagnosis, clinical stage, breast cancer treatment, and date of birth. Sociodemographic and cancer treatment data, as well as clinical HIV data, were extracted from physical and electronic medical records and secondary Instituto Nacional of cancer databases. To estimate survival, the Kaplan-Meier method was used. To determine the factors associated with mortality, Cox regression were used.The mean age of patients at diagnosis of cancer was 52 years. Regarding marital status, HIV+ patients had a higher frequency of single status). There were 44.1% deaths that occurred during the study period. Among HIV+ patients, there were 16 deaths, 15 of which were due to cancer. In HIV- patients there were 44 deaths (44%), with 32 cancer as the cause of death and 12 due to other causes. For the analysis of Overall. Differences were found in overall survival at 60 months (p=0.026), 55% and 69% respectively. The increased risk of death at 60 months among HIV+ women was observed also, after adjusting for schooling and molecular subtype (HR=1.95; 95% CI 1.03 - 3.70; p=0.041).HIV infection influenced a worse prognosis for women with breast cancer regardless of tumor factors.",
  "Occult breast cancer (OBC) is classified as carcinoma of an unknown primary site, and the adequate therapy for OBC remains controversial. This retrospective study aimed to reveal the transition in breast cancer therapy and the frequency of primary breast tumors after resection in clinical OBC (cT0N+) patients using the Japanese Breast Cancer Registry database.We enrolled OBC patients with cT0N+ from the registry between 2010 and 2018. On the basis of the period of diagnosis, OBC patients were divided into the following two groups: 2010-2014 and 2015-2018. We described the transition in treatments and tumor characteristics. After breast resection, the frequency of pathological identification of primary tumors and tumor sizes was assessed.Of the 687,468 patients registered, we identified 148 cT0N+ patients with a median age of 61\u00a0years. Of these patients, 64.2% (n\u2009=\u200995) received breast surgery (2010-2014: 79.1%, 2015-2018: 50.0%). Axillary lymph node dissection was performed in 92.6% (n\u2009=\u2009137, 2010-2014: 91.6%, 2015-2018: 93.4%). The breast tumor size in the resected breast was 0-7.0\u00a0cm (median: 0\u00a0cm, 2010-2014: 0-7.0\u00a0cm [median: 0\u00a0cm], 2015-2018: 0-6.2\u00a0cm [median: 0\u00a0cm]). The pathological identification rate of the primary tumor was 41.1% (n\u2009=\u200939, 2010-2014: 40.4%, 2015-2018: 42.1%).Breast surgery for cT0N+ decreased between 2010 and 2018. Despite the high identification rate of primary tumors, most tumors were small, and there was no significant change in the identification rate or invasive diameter of the identified tumors after 2010.",
  "Insulin resistance is associated with higher all-cause and cancer-specific mortality in postmenopausal women. However, to the authors' knowledge, information regarding insulin resistance and breast cancer mortality risk is limited. Therefore, the authors examined associations between insulin resistance and breast cancer incidence and mortality in a subsample of Women's Health Initiative participants.A total of 22,837 postmenopausal women with fasting baseline glucose and insulin levels were followed for incident breast cancer and breast cancer mortality. Breast cancers were verified by medical record review and serial National Death Index linkage-enhanced mortality findings. Insulin resistance was estimated using the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for quartile comparisons. Outcomes included breast cancer incidence, deaths from breast cancer, and deaths after breast cancer (breast cancer followed by death from any cause).During a median of 19.8 years of follow-up of 1328 breast cancer cases, there were 512 deaths reported, 151 of which were from breast cancer. Breast cancer incidence was higher in women in the highest HOMA-IR quartile (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.12-1.61 [P for trend\u00a0=\u00a0.003]). Although HOMA-IR was not found to be associated with risk of death from breast cancer (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.60-1.79), women in the highest versus those in the lowest HOMA-IR quartile were at a higher risk of death after breast cancer (HR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.32-2.39 [P for trend <.001]).Higher levels of insulin resistance in postmenopausal women are associated with higher breast cancer incidence and higher all-cause mortality after breast cancer.",
  "Accumulating evidence suggests that statins have a beneficial effect on breast cancer prognosis. Previous studies have reported a positive association between statin use and breast cancer survival; however, the relationship between statin use and patterns of breast cancer recurrence remains unclear.We identified all Malm\u00f6 Diet and Cancer Study (MDCS) participants diagnosed with incident invasive breast cancer between 2005 and 2014. The follow-up period began at breast cancer diagnosis and continued until the first invasive breast cancer recurrence event, death, emigration or the end of the follow-up (June 8, 2020). We estimated incidence rates (IRs) of recurrence and fit Cox regression models to compute crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for disease recurrence to compare post-diagnosis statin users with non-users.The final study cohort consisted of 360 eligible patients with a median follow-up of 8.6 years. Overall, there were 71 recurrences in 2932 total person-years. According to statin use, there were 14 recurrences in 595 person-years among statin users, and 57 recurrences in 2337 person-years in non-users. Statin use was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer recurrence (HR<sub>adj</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.88 [95% CI: 0.82-0.96]). Regarding the pattern of recurrence, statin use was associated with a reduced risk of distant recurrence (HR<sub>adj</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.86 [95% CI: 0.80-0.94]) but not loco-regional recurrence (HR<sub>adj</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.97 [95% CI: 0.87-1.08]).In the MDCS, statin use was associated with a reduced risk of distant breast cancer recurrence, whereas no association between statin use and loco-regional breast cancer recurrence was found. This site-based difference in disease recurrence may be explained by statin's inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.",
  "Liver metastasis is a significant adverse predictor of overall survival (OS) among breast cancer patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the risk and prognostic factors of breast cancer with liver metastases (BCLM).Data on 311,573 breast cancer patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and 1728 BCLM patients from Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (FUSCC) were included. Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for liver metastasis. Cox proportional hazards regression model was adopted to determine independent prognostic factors in BCLM patients.Young age, invasive ductal carcinoma, higher pathological grade, and subtype of triple-negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+) were risk factors for developing liver metastasis. The median OS after liver metastasis was 20.0\u2009months in the SEER database and 27.3\u2009months in the FUSCC dataset. Molecular subtypes also played a critical role in the survival of BCLM patients. We observed that hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/HER2+ patients had the longest median OS (38.0 for SEER vs. 34.0\u2009months for FUSCC), whereas triple-negative breast cancer had the shortest OS (9.0 vs. 15.6\u2009months) in both SEER and FUSCC. According to the results from the FUSCC, the subtype of HR+/HER2+ (hazard ratio (HR)\u2009=\u20092.62; 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u20091.88-3.66; P\u2009<\u20090.001) and HR-/HER2+ (HR\u2009=\u20093.43; 95% CI\u2009=\u20092.28-5.15; P\u2009<\u20090.001) were associated with a significantly increased death risk in comparison with HR+/HER2- patients if these patients did not receive HER2-targeted therapy. For those who underwent HER2-targeted therapy, however, HR+/HER2+ subtype reduced death risk compared with HR+/HER2- subtype (HR\u2009=\u20090.74; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.58-0.95; P\u2009<\u20090.001).Breast cancer patients at a high risk for developing liver metastasis deserve more attention during the follow-up. BCLM patients with HR+/HER2+ subtype displayed the longest median survival than HR+/HER2- and triple-negative patients due to the introduction of HER2-targeted therapy and therefore it should be recommended for HER2+ BCLM patients.",
  "Loss to follow-up (LTFU) during post-operative surveillance of breast cancer patients is detrimental. The pattern of LTFU and its risk factors in Chinese breast cancer patients remains unknown.Eligible non-metastatic breast cancer patients who underwent surgery at our institution between 2009 and 2012 were included. The clinicopathological features, as well as the LTFU status, were retrieved from the REDCap database. LTFU was defined as the absence of patients for at least 12 months since her last contact. 5-year LTFU was defined as the LTFU status of each patients at 5 years after surgery. The incidence and potential risk factors of LTFU were analyzed. A LTFU-risk score was developed to quantify the risk of LTFU.A total of 1536 patients with breast cancer were included, and 411(26.8%) patients were 5-year LTFU. 198 patients were LTFU in the first year. Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that age (younger and older), a lack of medical insurance, longer distance from residence to the hospital, pathology (DCIS/Paget's/Phyllodes), lymph node metastasis, the absence of endocrine therapy and fewer than five contact numbers were significantly and independently associated with the risk of LTFU. A LTFU-risk score was developed and was predictive of LTFU.A series of risk factors were significantly associated with post-operative LTFU of breast cancer patients. Patients with different risks of LTFU could possibly be identified, and surveillance plans could be individualized for different patients, so as to effectively reduce the overall LTFU rate, and optimize the allocation of medical resources.",
  "This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in BRCA-mutated advanced breast cancer patients comprehensively.We conducted a systematic literature research through PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), wanfang, China Biology Medicine disc (CBMdisc), and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to January 2021. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with available data comparing PARP inhibitors versus control therapy in BRCA-mutated advanced breast cancer were eligible for analysis. Statistical analyses were performed with Review Manager (RevMan) version 5.4 and R version 4.0.3.1706 studies were retrieved in total, and 4 RCTs with 1540 patients were eligible for meta-analysis finally. The results showed that progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were significantly improved in germline BRCA-mutated breast cancer patients with PARP inhibitors (HR 0.64, 95% CI [0.56-0.74]; HR 0.86, 95% CI [0.74-0.99], respectively) with no significant heterogeneity across studies (I<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a022%, \u03c7<sup>2</sup> p\u00a0=\u00a00.28; I<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00%, \u03c7<sup>2</sup> p\u00a0=\u00a00.70, respectively). There was no significant difference in the overall adverse events (AEs), grade\u22653 AEs and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation between PARP inhibitor arms and control arms (RR 1.01, 95% CI [0.99-1.02]; RR 0.95, 95% CI [0.83-1.09]; RR 1.17, 95% CI [0.87-1.57], respectively). Based on the available data, PARP inhibitors provided comparable or better results than control arms in improving the quality of life in BRCA-mutated advanced breast cancer patients.PARP inhibitors prolonged PFS and OS among patients with BRCA-mutated advanced breast cancer with tolerable safety and improved quality of life.",
  "BRCA1/2 mutated breast cancer accounts for 3 to 12% of all women with breast cancer and significantly increases the lifetime risk of breast cancer. However, the optimal local treatment for breast cancer with BRCA germline mutation remains controversial. Here we present a meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of breast-conserving therapy (BCT) on the prognosis of breast cancer with BRCA mutation.Two independent reviewers searched Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases for relevant studies on BCT and BRCA mutated breast cancer. Fixed or random effect models were used for meta-analyses based on whether significant heterogeneity existed among included studies. Funnel plot and Begg's test were employed for the evaluation of publication bias.Totally, four studies with five cohorts and a totally 1254 patients were included for meta-analyses. The BCT group involved more T0/T1 (BCT 63.7% Vs. M 48.9%, p\u2009<\u20090.001), N0 (BCT 70.5% Vs. M 56.2%, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and ER negative (BCT 58.8% Vs. M 49.3% p\u2009<\u20090.01) tumors than M group. Patients who received M tended to have prophylactic contralateral mastectomy (BCT 16.5% Vs. M 35.8%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). BCT had a significant higher risk for local recurrence than M (HR 3.838, 95% CI\u2009=\u20092.376-6.201, p\u2009<\u20090.001). The pooled results revealed no significant impact of BCT on disease-free survival (DFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS), breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and overall survival (OS).The present meta-analysis suggested that BCT had increasing local recurrence risk, but did not significantly impact patient survival in terms of DFS, MFS, BCSS and OS. BCT may serve as a safe alternative to mastectomy for breast cancer with BRCA mutation. Further high-quality randomized control trials are warranted to explore the optimal surgical management for BRCA mutation carriers.",
  "As the incidence of breast cancer has increased and the survival rate has improved, supporting the optimal follow-up strategy has become an important issue. This study aimed to evaluate follow-up imaging usage after breast cancer surgery and the implications on mortality in Korea.This study included 96,575 breast cancer patients diagnosed during 2002-2010 and registered in the Korea Central Cancer Registry, Statistics Korea, and Korean National Health Insurance Service. We evaluated the frequency of breast imaging (mammography and breast MRI) and systemic imaging for evaluating the presence of distant metastasis (chest CT, bone scan, and PET-CT), and performed analyses to determine if they had an effect on mortality.The median follow-up period was 72.9\u00a0months (range: 12.0-133.3) and 7.5% of the patients died. Among all patients, 54.7%, 16.2%, 45.6%, and 8.5% received 3 or more mammograms, chest CTs, bone scans, and PET-CTs within 3\u00a0years after surgery, respectively. Among patients who developed recurrence after 3 or more years, a comparison of overall mortality and breast-cancer specific mortality according to the frequency of imaging by modality (<3 vs. \u22653) showed that only mammography had significantly reduced mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.61-0.84, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001; HR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.61-0.84; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).This study showed that only frequent mammography reduced mortality and frequent imaging follow-up with other modalities did not when compared to less frequent imaging. This finding provides supportive evidence that clinicians need to adhere to the current guidelines for surveillance after breast cancer surgery.",
  "Owing to low incidence rates, population-based breast cancer screening is not recommended by many municipalities in Japan for women aged <\u200940\u00a0years. To evaluate the usefulness of screening in women aged <\u200940\u00a0years, we investigated the results of population-based breast cancer screening among young women performed in the Ibaraki Prefecture.Data regarding histological characteristics, recall rates, cancer detection rates, positive predictive values, tumor categories, and status of lymph node metastases were obtained from population-based screening data from Ibaraki Health Service Association Institute. The \"number needing to be screened\" (NNS) was determined; using Pearson's chi-squared test, these data were compared between women aged <\u200940\u00a0years and >\u200940\u00a0years.The data of 428,560 women were evaluated. Cancer detection rates were significantly lower and the NNS and proportion of women with tumor category T2 or higher was significantly increased in women aged <\u200940\u00a0years than in those aged >\u200940\u00a0years (0.06% vs. 0.21%, 1505 vs. 281-439, and 28.9% vs. 6.3%, respectively; all, p\u2009<\u20090.05). The proportion of early-stage cancers was lower in women aged <\u200940\u00a0years than in those >\u200940\u00a0years, but this was not significant.These results suggest that population-based breast cancer screening should not be recommended for women aged <\u200940\u00a0years. To reduce the breast cancer-related mortality rate in young women and ensure efficient use of limited medical resources in Japan, a more efficient surveillance system, based on genetic propensity and family history, needs to be established.",
  "Although tumor grade, defined by either the nuclear grade (NG) or the histological grade (HG), is widely accepted as one of the prognostic factors for breast cancer, there is a limited direct comparison between these two grading systems. The object of the current study was to compare their prognostic capabilities on the same specimen in a single institutional cohort.We collected data from 1125 patients with breast cancer who underwent surgery at Kaizuka City Hospital between 2002 and 2016 and analyzed the prognostic capability of NG and HG in comparison with other clinicopathological factors. Pathological diagnoses were performed by a single pathologist throughout the study period.The median follow-up was 52.9\u00a0months. During the follow-up period, 103 distant recurrences were observed. The concordance rate of grades between NG and HG was 72.1%. The 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates for patients with NG1, NG2, and NG3 were 90.6%, 91.8%, and 82.2%, respectively, and the rates for patients with HG1, HG2, and HG3 were 92.7%, 88.6%, and 82.5%, respectively. Significant differences in RFS were noted among each grade for HG. However, this was not true for NG; a significant difference was not noted between NG1 and NG2. In terms of subtypes, both NG3 and HG3 were significantly associated with worse outcomes in patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative tumors.Although not a few patients exhibited discordant results between NG and HG, both NG and HG predict outcomes for breast cancer patients, but the latter might appear to be superior as a three-grade classification scale.",
  "We provide a critical assessment regarding current evidence for the use of moderately hypofractionated irradiation for patients with breast cancer. The aim of the study was to summarize the available evidence regarding outcomes after moderately hypofractionated compared with conventional radiation doses in the post-operative treatment of patients with breast cancer.The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS databases were searched until March 25, 2021. All randomized phase 3 clinical trials that compared moderately hypofractionated with conventional radiation doses in the post-operative treatment of patients with breast cancer were selected. This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement.Eight clinical trials satisfied the eligibility criteria and were the focus of the analysis. A total of 12,139 breast cancer patients was randomly assigned for moderately hypofractionated compared with conventional irradiation. Meta-analysis of the trials regarding local recurrence, loco-regional recurrence, disease-free survival, and overall survival outcomes did not demonstrate any significant difference between moderately hypofractionated irradiation and conventional radiation doses groups. The rate of severe side effects was low in both groups; acute and late side effects and cosmesis were similar or even tended to be lower after moderately hypofractionated than after conventional irradiation.Moderately hypofractionated is at least as effective and safe as conventional radiation irradiation regimens and should be considered as a treatment option for most, if not all, breast cancer patients.",
  "Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This is the first study to provide data on predisposition of breast cancer susceptibility genes with associated clinical and pathological aspects in the UAE.A retrospective chart review for breast cancer patients undergoing genetic testing from 2016 to 2018. According to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines genetic testing was offered. The analyzed data included; age, ethnicity, family cancer history, pathogenic variant, histopathology, stage, molecular subtype and proliferation.309 patients underwent genetic testing with a positive result in 130 patients (11.9%) over a period of 36 months. In 34.6% pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were identified. BRCA2 was the most common gene identified. The mean age was 42.9 years (\u00b19.01). Positive family history was identified in 66 patients (50.7%). Majority had stage 1 or 2 disease (66.2%), invasive ductal carcinoma (81.5%) and hormone receptor positive cancer (45.3%).This is the first study in the UAE to describe the clinical and pathological characteristics of hereditary breast cancer in a mixed ethnic group with dominant Arabic population. Further genetic studies will be required in the UAE population, as the prevalence of breast cancer continues to rise.",
  "Breast cancer outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa is reported to be poor, with an estimated five-year survival of 50% when compared to almost 90% in high-income countries. Although several studies have looked at the effect of HIV in breast cancer survival, the effect of ARTs has not been well elucidated.All females newly diagnosed with invasive breast cancer from May 2015-September 2017\u00a0at Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic and Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital were enrolled. We analysed overall survival and disease-free survival, comparing HIV positive and negative patients. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated with p-values calculated using a log-rank test of equality while hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox regression models.Of 1019 patients enrolled, 22% were HIV positive. The overall survival (95% CI) was 53.5% (50.1-56.7%) with a disease-free survival of 55.8% (52.1-59.3) after 4 years of follow up. HIV infection was associated with worse overall survival (HR (95% CI): 1.50 (1.22-1.85), p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and disease-free survival (OR (95% CI):2.63 (1.71-4.03), p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), especially among those not on ART at the time of breast cancer diagnosis. Advanced stage of the disease and hormone-receptor negative breast cancer subtypes were also associated with poor survival.HIV infection was associated with worse overall and disease-free survival. HIV patients on ARTs had favourable overall and disease-free survival and with ARTs now being made accessible to all the outcome of women with HIV and breast cancer is expected to improve.",
  "Breast cancer is the most lethal malignancy in women. N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 6 (GALNT6) is an enzyme which mediates the initial step of mucin-type O-glycosylation, and has been reported to be involved in mammary carcinogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism of GALNT6 in breast cancer metastasis has not been fully explored. In this study, based on online database analyses and tissue microarrays, the overall survival (OS) of breast cancer patients with high expression of GALNT6 was found to be shorter than those with low expression of GALNT6. Also, high GALNT6 expression was positively correlated with advanced pN stage and pTNM stage. GALNT6 was shown to be able to promote the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells, and enhance the level of mucin-type O-glycosylation of substrates in the supernatants of breast cancer cells. Qualitative mucin-type glycosylomics analysis identified \u03b12M as a novel substrate of GALNT6. Further investigation showed that GALNT6 increased O-glycosylation of \u03b12M, and the following activation of the downstream PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was involved in the promotion of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. This study identified a new substrate of GALNT6 and provides novel understanding of the role of GALNT6 in promoting metastasis and poor prognosis in breast cancer.",
  "To clarify the effect of postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) on pT<sub>1-2</sub>N<sub>1</sub> breast cancer patients with different molecular subtypes.We retrospectively analyzed the data of 5442 patients with pT<sub>1-2</sub>N<sub>1</sub> breast cancer treated using modified radical mastectomy in 11 hospitals in China. Univariate, multivariate, and propensity score matching (PSM) analyses were used to evaluate the effect of PMRT on locoregional recurrence (LRR).With a median follow-up duration of 63.8 months, the 5-year LRR rates were 4.0% and 7.7% among patients treated with and without PMRT, respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). PMRT was independently associated with reduced LRR after adjustments for confounders (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). After grouping the patients according to the molecular subtype of cancer and conducting PSM, we found that the 5-year LRR rates among patients treated with and without PMRT (in that order) were as follows: luminal HER2-negative cancer, 1.9% and 6.5% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001); luminal HER2-positive cancer, 3.8% and 13.7% (p\u00a0=\u00a00.041); HER2-overexpressing cancer, 10.2% and 15.5% (p\u00a0=\u00a00.236); and triple-negative cancer, 4.6% and 15.9% (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). Among patients with HER2-overexpressing and triple-negative cancers, the LRR hazard rate displayed a dominant early peak, and was extremely low after 5 years. However, patients with luminal cancer continued to have a long-lasting high annual LRR hazard rate during follow-up.PMRT significantly reduced the LRR risk in patients with pT<sub>1-2</sub>N<sub>1</sub> luminal and triple-negative breast cancers, but had no effect on the LRR risk in patients with HER2-overexpressing cancer. Patients with different molecular subtypes displayed different annual LRR patterns, and the late recurrence of the luminal subtype suggests the necessity of long-term follow-up to evaluate the efficacy of PMRT.",
  "Transcription coregulator adapter protein FE65 is well known to play pivotal roles in pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease by regulating amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression and processing. APP was recently reported to be also involved in development of human malignancies. Therefore, in this study, we studied FE65 status in different subtypes of human breast cancer and correlated the results with cell proliferation and migration of carcinoma cells and clinicopathological features of breast cancer patients to explore its biological and clinical significance in breast cancer.We first immunolocalized FE65 and APP in 138 breast cancer patients and correlated the results with their tumor grade. Then, we did further exploration by proximity ligation assay, WST-8, and wound-healing assay.FE65 immunoreactivity in carcinoma cells was significantly associated with lymph-node metastasis, ER\u03b1, and high pathological N factor. APP immunoreactivity was significantly positively correlated with high pathological N factor. FE65, APP, and p-APP were all significantly correlated with shorter disease-free survival of breast cancer patients. In addition, the status of FE65 was significantly associated with overall survival. Results of in vitro analysis revealed that FE65 promoted the migration and proliferation of T-47D and ZR-75-1 breast carcinoma cells. In situ proximity ligation assay revealed that FE65 could bind to APP in the cytoplasm. FE65 was also associated with APP and ER\u03b1 in carcinoma cells, suggesting their cooperativity in promoting carcinoma cell proliferation and migration. APP was also significantly associated with adverse clinical outcome of the patients.This is the first study to explore the clinical significance of FE65 in human breast cancer. The significant positive correlation of FE65 with poor clinical outcome, direct binding to APP, and promotion of carcinoma cell proliferation and migration indicated that FE65-APP pathway could serve as the potential candidate of therapeutic intervention in breast cancer patients.",
  "As a special reproductive hormone and ovarian reserve indicator, the role of anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) in premenopausal women with breast cancer deserves further study.We conducted an in-depth analysis of the data from the EGOFACT study (NCT02518191), a phase \u2162, randomized, controlled trial involving premenopausal female breast cancer patients in two parallel groups: chemotherapy with or without gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs (GnRHa). Three hundred thirty premenopausal women aged 25-49 years with operable stage I to III breast cancer were included in this study. The characteristics of ovarian reserve changes marked by AMH in the EGOFACT study and the factors affecting ovarian function in premenopausal women with breast cancer were analyzed.The AMH level of the chemotherapy alone group decreased gradually within one year, while the AMH level of the GnRHa group was significantly higher as early as 6 months after chemotherapy and recovered to close to the baseline level 12 months after chemotherapy (F\u00a0=\u00a034.991, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Correlation analysis showed that the factors affecting AMH levels mainly included age, menarche age, body mass index (BMI), reproductive history, baseline follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level, pathological stage and GnRHa application, but they had different effects on the incidence of premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) at different periods. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that menarche age younger than 14 years (OR 0.470 [0.259, 0.852], P\u00a0=\u00a00.013), baseline AMH level higher than 0.5\u00a0ng/mL (OR 9.590 [3.366, 27.320], P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), pathological stage \u2160(OR 0.315 [0.124, 0.798], P\u00a0=\u00a00.015) and GnRHa application (OR 0.090 [0.045, 0.183], P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were independent factors conducive to protection of ovarian reserve, as well as to recovery of ovarian reserve.Age, menarche age, baseline AMH level, and GnRHa application are the most important influencing factors for ovarian reserve in premenopausal women with breast cancer.ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02518191, registered on Aug 5, 2015.",
  "The Time to First Metastatic Recurrence (TFMR) could be considered as an indirect reflection of the tumour growth kinetics which plays an important role in cancer. Molecular subtypes such as expression of estrogen receptor are known predictive factors of TFMR. The Cin\u00e9Breast study aimed to identify predictive factors of the time to TFMR.The French Epidemiological Strategy and Medical Economics (ESME) Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) Database (NCT03275311) was used, which contains data from a cohort of metastatic breast cancer patients from 2008 to 2016 using retrospective data collection. It is a national multi-centre database. The impact of TFMR on overall survival (OS) since first metastasis was also evaluated.Among 16\u00a0702 patients recorded in the ESME MBC database, 10\u00a0595 had an initially localised breast cancer with hormone receptor (HR) and HER2 status available, with a metastatic recurrence. Median follow up was 56 months. Median TFMR was 59 months (<24: 20%, 24-60: 31%, 60-120: 25%, >120: 24%). HER2+ and TNBC were respectively 4 times and 12 times (p\u202f<\u202f0.0001) more likely to have a recurrence within 2 years when compared to the luminal subgroup. Short TFMR and HR-/HER2-subtype significantly correlated with a poor OS in multivariate analysis. Some patients with MBC (20% in HER2+, 10% in ER+/HER2-and <5% in the ER-/HER2-) were long-term survivors in all 3 subgroups.In this large-scale real-life data study, patients with a TNBC metastatic recurrence had a shorter TFMR. Short TFMR significantly correlated with worse overall survival.",
  "We aim to evaluate the prognostic and predictive value of TOP2A and HER2 expression in T1N0 breast cancer patients.299 cases with T1N0 breast cancer were obtained from the Oncomine database (Cohort 1) and 963 of T1N0 breast cancer patients from Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital (Cohort 2) were retrospectively enrolled. Kaplan-Meier product was applied to estimate survival curve. Cox proportional hazard models was used to identify prognostic factors. We used PSM (propensity score matching) to balance clinicopathologic characteristics among four groups of different HER2/TOP2A status. Survival between groups and chemotherapy regimens were analyzed, before and after PSM.In Cohort 1, we found that the group with HER2+\u2009and higher expression of TOP2A mRNA was associated with poor breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) compared to the group of HER2- with lower expression of TOP2A mRNA. In Cohort 2, HER2+\u2009patients with higher TOP2A protein expression had greater risk of recurrence and distant recurrence compared to HER2- patients with lower expression of TOP2A protein. Among the patients who developed both HER2+\u2009and higher expression of TOP2A protein and received chemotherapy, patients who received an anthracycline-based regimen had a significantly better recurrence-free survival (RFS) than those with a non-anthracycline-based regime.Patients with both HER2+\u2009and high expression level of TOP2A protein predicts poor prognosis in T1N0 breast cancer patients. Patients with double positive for TOP2A protein and HER2 may benefit from anthracycline-based regimens.",
  "To use pathologic indicators to determine which patients benefit from postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) for breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and total mastectomy (TM).We enrolled 4236 patients with breast invasive ductal carcinoma who received NACT followed by TM. Cox regression analysis was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and confidence intervals; independent predictors were controlled for or stratified in the analysis.After multivariate Cox regression analyses, the adjusted HRs derived for PMRT for all-cause mortality were 0.65 (0.52-0.81, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and 0.58 (0.47-0.71, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) in postchemotherapy pathologic tumor stages T2-4 (ypT3-4) and postchemotherapy pathologic nodal stages N2-3 (ypN2-3), respectively. Moreover, adjusted HRs derived for PMRT with all-cause mortality were 0.51 (0.38-0.69, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), 0.60 (0.40-0.88, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0096), and 0.64 (0.48-0.86, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0024) in pathological stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC, respectively. Additionally, the PMRT group showed significant locoregional control irrespective of the pathologic response, even ypT0, ypN0, or pathological complete response (pCR), compared with the No-PMRT group. The multivariate analysis showed no statistical differences between the PMRT and No-PMRT groups for distant metastasis-free survival in any pathologic response of ypT0-4, ypN0-3, and pathologic American Joint Committee on Cancer stages pCR to IIIC.For patients with breast cancer ypT3-4, ypN2-3, or pathologic stages IIIA-IIIC receiving NACT and TM, benefit from PMRT if it is associated with OS benefits, regardless of the clinical stage of the disease. Compared with No-PMRT, PMRT improved locoregional recurrence-free survival, even pCR, in patients with breast cancer receiving NACT and TM.",
  "Various long-term symptoms can manifest after breast cancer treatment, but we wanted to clarify whether these are more frequent among long-term breast cancer survivors than matched controls and if they are associated with certain diagnoses.This was a cross-sectional, population-based study of 350 breast cancer survivors treated with chemo- and/or radiotherapy \u22655 years (median 10) after diagnosis and 350 women without cancer matched by age and primary care physician. All women completed a questionnaire enquiring about symptoms, underwent echocardiography to assess the left ventricle ejection fraction, and completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Cardiovascular diseases were diagnosed from primary care records. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis, symptoms were adjusted for the long-term effects and compared between cohorts and within the survivor group.Concentration difficulties, forgetfulness, dizziness, and nocturia were more frequent among breast cancer survivors compared with controls, but differences could not be explained by cardiac dysfunction, cardiovascular diseases, depression, or anxiety. Intermittent claudication and appetite loss were more frequent among breast cancer survivors than controls and associated with cardiac dysfunction, depression, and anxiety.\u00a0Breast cancer survivors treated with chemotherapy with/without radiotherapy were at significantly higher odds of forgetfulness and nocturia, but significantly lower odds of dizziness, compared with breast cancer survivors treated with radiotherapy alone.Intermittent claudication and appetite loss are common among breast cancer survivors and are associated with cardiac dysfunction and mood disorders. Other symptoms varied by whether the patient underwent chemotherapy with/without radiotherapy (forgetfulness and nocturia) radiotherapy alone (dizziness).",
  "To examine clinicodemographic determinants associated with breast cancer survivorship follow-up during COVID-19.We performed a retrospective, population-based cohort study including early stage (Stage I-II) breast cancer patients who underwent resection between 2006 and 2018 in a New York City hospital system. The primary outcome was oncologic follow-up prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondary analyses compared differences in follow-up by COVID-19 case rates stratified by ZIP code.A total of 2942 patients with early-stage breast cancer were available for analysis. 1588 (54%) of patients had attended follow-up in the year prior to the COVID-19 period but failed to continue to follow-up during the pandemic, either in-person or via telemedicine. 1242 (42%) patients attended a follow-up appointment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared with patients who did not present for follow-up during COVID-19, patients who continued their oncologic follow-up during the pandemic were younger (p\u00a0=\u00a00.049) more likely to have received adjuvant radiation therapy (p\u00a0=\u00a00.025), and have lower household income (p\u00a0=\u00a00.031) on multivariate modeling. When patients who live in Bronx, New York, were stratified by ZIP code, there was a modest negative association (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.56) between COVID-19 cases and proportion of patients who continued to follow-up during the COVID-19 period.We observed a dramatic disruption in routine breast cancer follow-up during the COVID-19 pandemic. Providers and health systems should emphasize reintegrating patients who missed appointments during COVID-19 back into regular surveillance programs to avoid significant morbidity and mortality from missed breast cancer recurrences.",
  "Bilateral-Risk-Reducing-Mastectomy-(BRRM) is well described in BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant carriers. However, little is known about the relative uptake, time trends or factors influencing uptake in those at increased breast cancer risk not known to be carriers. The aim of this study is to assess these factors in both groups.BRRM uptake was assessed from entry to the Manchester Family History Clinic or from date of personal BRCA1/2 test. Follow up was censored at BRRM, breast cancer diagnosis, death or January 01, 2020. Cumulative incidence and cause specific and competing risk regression analyses were used to assess the significance of factors associated with BRRM.Of 7195 women at \u226525% lifetime breast cancer risk followed for up to 32 years, 451 (6.2%) underwent pre-symptomatic BRRM. Of those eligible in different risk groups the 20-year uptake of BRRM was 47.7%-(95%CI\u00a0=\u00a042.4-53.2%) in 479 BRCA1/2 carriers; 9.0% (95%CI\u00a0=\u00a07.26-11.24%) in 1261 women at \u226540% lifetime risk (non-BRCA), 4.8%-(95%CI\u00a0=\u00a03.98-5.73%) in 3561 women at 30-39% risk and 2.9%-(95%CI\u00a0=\u00a02.09-4.09%) in 1783 women at 25-29% lifetime risk. In cause-specific Cox regression analysis death of a sister with breast cancer<50 (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.4; 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.7-3.4), mother<60 (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.9; 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.5-2.3), having children (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.4; 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.1-1.8), breast biopsy (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.4; 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.0-1.8) were all independently associated with BRRM uptake, while being older at assessment was less likely to be associated with BRRM (>50; OR\u00a0=\u00a00.26,95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.17-0.41). Uptake continued to rise to 20 years from initial risk assessment.We have identified several additional factors that correlate with BRRM uptake and demonstrate continued increases over time. These factors will help to tailor counselling and support for women.",
  "Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are an important component of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in breast cancer. They have been linked with tumor pathogenesis in advanced stages. However, little is known about their contribution in early phases. In this study, we analyzed the infiltration of leukocytes and cancer stem cells (CSC) in tumors from patients with early breast cancer.Samples of blood and tumor tissue from 30 patients with breast cancer were collected, and the number of dendritic cells (DC), T cells, and CSC were analyzed by flow cytometry.Tumor-infiltrating CD4 and CD8 T cells expressed higher levels of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) compared with peripheral T cells. Regulatory T cells (Treg) were enriched in tumors and overexpressed glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related protein and CTLA-4. Tumor Treg had a positive correlation with the amount of myeloid DC (mDC) and disease progression. The CD8/Treg ratio was associated with lymph node metastasis and tumor stages. The main subset of DC in early breast tumors was mDC, while plasmacytoid DC were almost absent. CSC were present in most tumors with higher frequencies in patients with lymph node metastasis. CSC were also associated with the amount of tumor-infiltrating Treg.Early breast cancer has an inflammatory milieu characterized by mDC, Treg, and CSC infiltration. The frequencies of Treg, CSC and CD8/Treg ratio were associated with disease progression. The composition of leukocytes and the presence of CSC in early breast tumors should be considered for the development of new therapeutic approaches.",
  "The prevalence of pregnancy-associated breast cancer is increasing. HER2-positive breast cancers typically have a poor prognosis. The objective of our study was to compare the prognosis of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy (HER2-positive BCP) to young women diagnosed with HER2-positive breast cancer outside of pregnancy (HER2 non-BCP).Data of patients managed for invasive breast carcinoma between January 2005 and 2020 were retrospectively collected from the database of Tenon University Hospital (Paris, France), part of the \"Cancer li\u00e9 \u00e0 la Grossesse\" network.Fifty-one patients with HER2-positive BCP were matched on age at diagnosis with 51 HER2-positive non-BCP patients. Locally advanced disease with axillary lymph node involvement were frequent. Tumors were frequently aggressive with high grade (p\u00a0=\u00a00.57) and high Ki67 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.15). Among the HER2-positive BCP patients, the mean term at diagnosis was 19.3 week of gestation (WG). Eighty-four percent of the patients continued their pregnancy with a mean term at delivery of 34.2WG. Chemotherapy modalities differed between the two groups: neoadjuvant chemotherapy was more frequent in the HER2-positive BCP group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and adjuvant chemotherapy more frequent in the HER2 non-BCP group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009). The recurrence rate was 10% (n\u00a0=\u00a05) and 18% (n\u00a0=\u00a09) in the HER2-positive BCP and HER2 non-BCP groups, respectively, p\u00a0=\u00a00.25. Breast cancer-free survival was poorer in the HER2-positive BCP group with earlier recurrence, p\u00a0=\u00a00.008. No difference in type of recurrence was found between the groups (p\u00a0=\u00a00.58).This matched case-control study implies that patients with HER2-positive BCP still have a poorer prognosis than non-pregnant HER-positive patients.",
  "Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes play critical roles in immune surveillance, an important defence against tumors. Imputing HLA genotypes from existing single-nucleotide polymorphism datasets is low-cost and efficient. We investigate the relevance of the major histocompatibility complex region in breast cancer susceptibility, using imputed class I and II HLA alleles, in 25,484 women of Asian ancestry.A total of 12,901 breast cancer cases and 12,583 controls from 12 case-control studies were included in our pooled analysis. HLA imputation was performed using SNP2HLA on 10,886 quality-controlled variants within the 15-55\u00a0Mb region on chromosome 6. HLA alleles (n\u2009=\u2009175) with info scores greater than 0.8 and frequencies greater than 0.01 were included (resolution at two-digit level: 71; four-digit level: 104). We studied the associations between HLA alleles and breast cancer risk using logistic regression, adjusting for population structure and age. Associations between HLA alleles and the risk of subtypes of breast cancer (ER-positive, ER-negative, HER2-positive, HER2-negative, early-stage, and late-stage) were examined.We did not observe associations between any HLA allele and breast cancer risk at P\u2009<\u20095e-8; the smallest p value was observed for HLA-C*12:03 (OR\u2009=\u20091.29, P\u2009=\u20091.08e-3). Ninety-five percent of the effect sizes (OR) observed were between 0.90 and 1.23. Similar results were observed when different subtypes of breast cancer were studied (95% of ORs were between 0.85 and 1.18).No imputed HLA allele was associated with breast cancer risk in our large Asian study. Direct measurement of HLA gene expressions may be required to further explore the associations between HLA genes and breast cancer risk.",
  "The ultrasound (US) features of breast cancer have recently been shown to have prognostic significance. We aim to assess these features according to molecular subtype. 1140 consecutive US visible invasive breast cancers had US size and mean stiffness by shearwave elastography (SWE) recorded prospectively. Skin thickening (>\u20092.5\u00a0mm) overlying the cancer on US and the presence of posterior echo enhancement were assessed retrospectively while blinded to outcomes. Cancers were classified as luminal, triple negative (TN) or HER2\u2009+\u2009ve based on immunohistochemistry and florescent in-situ hybridization. The relationship between US parameters and breast cancer specific survival (BCSS) was ascertained using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and ROC analysis. At median follow-up 6.3\u00a0year, there were 117 breast cancer (10%) and 132 non-breast deaths (12%). US size was significantly associated with BCSS all groups (area under the curve (AUC) 0.74 in luminal cancers, 0.64 for TN and 0.65 for HER2\u2009+\u2009ve cancers). US skin thickening was associated most strongly with poor prognosis in TN cancers (53% vs. 80% 6\u00a0year survival, p\u2009=\u20090.0004). Posterior echo enhancement was associated with a poor BCSS in TN cancers (63% vs. 82% 6\u00a0year survival, p\u2009=\u20090.02). Mean stiffness at SWE was prognostic in the luminal and HER2 positive groups (AUC 0.69 and 0.63, respectively). In the subgroup of patients with TN cancers receiving neo-adjuvant chemotherapy posterior enhancement and skin thickening were not associated with response. US skin thickening is a poor prognostic indicator is all 3 subtypes studied, while posterior enhancement was associated with poor outcome in TN cancers.",
  "To evaluate the mammographic features in women with benign breast disease (BBD) and the risk of subsequent breast cancer according to their mammographic findings.We analyzed data from a Spanish cohort of women screened from 1995 to 2015 and followed up until December 2017 (median follow-up, 5.9 years). We included 10,650 women who had both histologically confirmed BBD and mammographic findings. We evaluated proliferative and nonproliferative BBD subtypes, and their mammographic features: architectural distortion, asymmetries, calcifications, masses, and multiple findings. The adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for breast cancer were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model. We plotted the adjusted cumulative incidence curves.Calcifications were more frequent in proliferative disease with atypia (43.9%) than without atypia (36.8%) or nonproliferative disease (22.2%; p value < 0.05). Masses were more frequent in nonproliferative lesions (59.1%) than in proliferative lesions without atypia (35.1%) or with atypia (30.0%; p value < 0.05). Multiple findings and architectural distortion were more likely in proliferative disease (16.1% and 4.7%) than in nonproliferative disease (12.8% and 1.9%). Subsequent breast cancer occurred in 268 (2.5%) women. Compared with women who had masses, the highest risk of subsequent breast cancer was found in those with architectural distortions (aHR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.16-4.22), followed by those with multiple findings (aHR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.34-2.66), asymmetries (aHR, 1.66; 95% CI, 0.84-3.28), and calcifications (aHR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.21-2.12).BBD subtypes showed distinct mammographic findings. The risk of subsequent breast cancer was high in those who have shown architectural distortion, multiple findings, asymmetries, and calcifications than in women with masses.\u2022 The presence of mammographic findings in women attending breast cancer screening helps clinicians to assess women with benign breast disease (BBD). \u2022 Calcifications were frequent in BBDs with atypia, which are the ones with a high breast cancer risk, while masses were common in low-risk BBDs. \u2022 The excess risk of subsequent breast cancer in women with BBD was higher in those who showed architectural distortion compared to those with masses.",
  "Cancer has been the leading cause of death in the past decade in Taiwan, with breast cancer being the most common type of cancer in females. Very few studies looked at the risk of recurrence in patients who received multidisciplinary team (MDT) care. We analyzed the influence of MDT on the risk of recurrence and death in breast cancer patients.In this retrospective study, we included newly diagnosed patients from 2004 to 2010. The study included 9,266 breast cancer patients who were enrolled in MDT care and 9,266 patients who were not. The study used log-rank test to analyze patients' characteristics, hospital characteristics, cancer staging, and treatment methods to compare the recurrence rates in MDT care and non-MDT care participants. We used Cox proportional hazards model to examine the effect of MDT and associated factors on the risk of recurrence and mortality of breast cancer patients.Relative risk of recurrence was lower for patients who received MDT care than for patients who did not (HR, 0.84; 95%CI: 0.70-0.99) after matching. The mortality risk for breast cancer patients with relapse was 8.48 times (95%CI: 7.53-9.54) than that for patients without relapse.The relative risk of recurrence and death was significantly lower for breast cancer patients who received MDT care than for those who did not. We suggest that MDT care be implanted in the National Health Policy settings of breast cancer patients.",
  "Previous studies have examined the association of statin therapy and breast cancer outcomes with mixed results. The objective of this study was to investigate the clinical effects of incident statin use among individuals with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare and Texas Cancer Registry-Medicare databases were used, and women aged \u226566 years who had stage I, II, and III breast cancer were identified. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to examine the association of new statin use in the 12 months after a breast cancer diagnosis with overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS).When examining incident statin use, defined as the initiation of statin therapy in the 12 months after breast cancer diagnosis, a significant association was observed between statin use and improved BCSS (standardized hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20-0.88; P = .022) and OS (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.50-0.99; P = .046) among patients with TNBC (n = 1534). No association was observed with BCSS (standardized hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.71-1.39; P = .97) or OS (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.92-1.17; P = .55) among those without TNBC (n = 15,979). The results were consistent when examining statin exposure as a time-varying variable.Among women with I, II, and III TNBC, initiation of statin therapy in the 12 months after breast cancer diagnosis was associated with an OS and BCSS benefit. Statins may have a role in select patients with breast cancer, and further investigation is warranted.",
  "Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 6 (TCL6) has been reported as a potential tumor suppressor. However, its expression and function in breast cancer remain unknown. This study was performed to investigate the expression of lncRNA TCL6 in breast cancer and its clinical significance.The survival and clinical molecular roles of TCL6 in breast cancer were analyzed. The underlying mechanism modulated by TCL6 and its correlation with immune-infiltrating cells were investigated. Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets were further used to confirm the prognostic role of TCL6.TCL6 low expression was not correlated with age, clinical stage, T stage, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, human epidermal growth factor 2 status, but was associated with estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor (PR) status and was an independent factor for worse survival (HR 1.876, P\u2009=\u20090.016). Specifically, low TCL6 expression correlated with worse prognosis in PR-negative patients. TCL6 could predict worse survival in luminal B breast cancer based on intrinsic subtypes. Immune-related pathways such as Janus kinase-signal transducer of activators of transcription were regulated by TCL6. Further finding revealed that TCL6 correlated with immune infiltrating cells such as B cells (r\u2009=\u20090.25, P\u2009<\u20090.001), CD8+ T cells (r\u2009=\u20090.23, P\u2009<\u20090.001), CD4+ T cells (r\u2009=\u20090.25, P\u2009<\u20090.001), neutrophils (r\u2009=\u20090.21, P\u2009<\u20090.001), and dendritic cells (r\u2009=\u20090.27, P\u2009<\u20090.001). TCL6 was also positively correlated with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes infiltration and PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, and CTLA-4 immune checkpoint molecules (P\u2009<\u20090.001).Our findings suggest that lncRNA TCL6 correlates with immune infiltration and may act as a useful prognostic molecular marker in breast cancer.",
  "Survival benefits of chemotherapy (CT) differ among patients with estrogen receptor-positive (ER\u2009+) breast cancer. This study investigated the survival benefits of CT for ER\u2009+\u2009and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer (BC) patients by propensity score matching (PSM).Patients with stages I-IIIER\u2009+\u2009/HER2- BC were enrolled in this study. The primary endpoints were 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in the non-CT and CT groups of the selected population matched by PS. The PS was analyzed by a logistic regression model with factors those influence provided indication of chemotherapy [tumor size, nuclear grade (NG), progesterone receptor, and nodal status].This study enrolled 895 patients between 2000 and 2015. The median follow-up period was 5.7\u00a0years. Overall, the 5-year RFS was 94.3% and 90.1% in the non-CT and CT-treated groups, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.106). The 5-year OS was 97.5% in the non-CT group and 95.6% in the CT group (p\u2009=\u20090.047). Using PSM, 236 patients were selected. After matching, both the 5-year RFS and the 5-year OS were higher in the CT group than in the non-CT group (96.8% vs. 82.7%, p\u2009=\u20090.003 and 100% vs. 91.9%, p\u2009<\u20090.001, respectively). Particularly in the case of the node negative/NG3 and 1-3 node positive/NG2 patients after PSM, the 5-year RFS was significantly higher in the CT group than in the non-CT group (p\u2009=\u20090.041 and p\u2009=\u20090.006, respectively).After PSM, CT significantly improved both the RFS and OS of ER\u2009+\u2009/ HER2- BC patients, especially for node negative/NG3 and 1-3 node positive/NG2 patients.",
  "The aim of this study was to analyse if breast cancer survivors without other breast imaging surveillance attend population-based screening differently than women not previously diagnosed with breast cancer. Further, to analyse if any differences depended on the women's age and years since previous cancer diagnosis. The study was a register-based retrospective cohort study of all women invited to participate in the national breast cancer screening programme in 2015-2016. Participation rates were calculated for breast cancer survivors without breast imaging within 21 months (2-4 years, 4-6 years, 6-10 years and more than 10 years after diagnosis) and for women without previous breast cancer. Relative differences in participation rates between the two groups were calculated. A total of 679,990 women were included in the study (2.6% breast cancer survivors). For breast cancer survivors, participation rates increased with increasing number of years since the previous cancer diagnosis peaking at 80.3% if the cancer diagnosis was more than 10 years ago. For women with no previous breast cancer, participation rate was 80.3%. The relative difference in participation was highest close to the breast cancer diagnosis and for the youngest women participation rates remained lower among breast cancer survivors even more than 10 years after the diagnosis. In conclusion, regardless of age and years since previous breast cancer diagnosis, breast cancer survivors had lower or similar participation rates than women with no previous cancer diagnosis. This indicated that as many as one fifth of the breast cancer survivors are at risk of inadequate surveillance.",
  "The potential benefit of additional breast cancer screening examinations in moderate risk patients (patients with a history of breast cancer in one or two family members) remains unclear.A large population-based case-control study on breast cancer in postmenopausal women in Germany recruited 2002-2005 (3813 cases and 7341 age-matched controls) was used to assess the association of family history with breast cancer risk. Analysis of family history, participation in screening procedures, and tumor size regarding prognosis in patients was based on follow-up data until 2015.A first degree family history of breast cancer was associated with higher breast cancer risk (OR 1.39, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Patients with a first degree family history of breast cancer were more likely to have had >10 mammograms (MG) (42.7% vs. 24.9%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and showed a higher rate of imaging-detected tumors (MG or ultrasound) (45.8% vs. 31.9%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). A smaller tumor size at initial diagnosis (below 2\u00a0cm) was more likely in patients with a positive family history (OR 1.45, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and a higher number of MG (\u226510\u00a0MG: OR 2.29). After accounting for tumor characteristics, mammogram regularity (HR 0.72, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and imaging-assisted tumor detection (HR 0.66, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were associated with better overall survival but not with a positive family history.Patients with a positive family history had a higher rate of imaging detected tumors with smaller size at initial diagnosis compared to patients without affected family members. Screening was associated with improved survival after a breast cancer diagnosis, irrespective of a positive family history.",
  "The efficacy of adjuvant endocrine therapy for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer has been previously established. However, significant adverse events related to endocrine therapy cannot be ignored. T1 breast cancer is expected to have a good prognosis. Therefore, adjuvant endocrine therapy for T1a breast cancer patients is controversial. Thus, in this study, we examined the effect of endocrine therapy on the prognosis of T1N0 hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer patients in each tumor size group, and re-considered the application of endocrine therapy.We retrospectively obtained clinical and pathological data from medical records of 7635 patients who underwent surgery for breast cancer at Aichi Cancer Hospital between January 2000 and December 2017. The primary end point of our analysis was disease-free survival (DFS). The secondary end points were distant disease-free survival (DDFS), overall survival (OS), and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS). The log-rank test, cumulative survival generated curves with Kaplan-Meier methods and the hazard ratio (HR) calculated with a Cox regression model were used to assess the effects of endocrine therapy on prognosis.The 5-year DFS was worse in the non-endocrine therapy (non-ET) group (78%) than the endocrine therapy (ET) group (95%) in the T1c population (p\u2009<\u20090.001, HR 0.25). However, there was no statistically significant difference in DFS between the ET and the non-ET groups in T1a (ET 96% vs non-ET 93%, p\u2009=\u20090.9314, HR 0.94) and T1b (ET 96% vs non-ET 93%, p\u2009=\u20090.1481HR 0.53) breast cancer. The OS, DDFS, and BCSS of the patients also showed that endocrine therapy was associated with improvement of the prognosis in the T1c group, but not in the T1a and T1b groups.Adjuvant endocrine therapy may be essential for T1c breast cancer patients. In contrast, this therapy should be discussed for T1a and T1b luminal breast cancer patients under some circumstances, such as suffering from adverse events.",
  "While a mammography-screening program (MSP) is being offered systematically in Germany since 2009, the dispanserizatsiya has been implemented in Russia since 2013. This study examined trends of stage at breast cancer diagnosis in two Russian regions and compared the results with the development in Germany. In addition, we aimed to gain further insights into the early detection of breast cancer in Russia.Incidence data from two cancer registries in Russia and 12 population-based cancer registries in Germany were used to analyse breast cancer incidence rates among women above age 30 over time. Further, we calculated rate ratios to compare the age group-specific incidence rates after the implementation of MSP in Germany (2010-2014) with the period before implementation (2003-2005) separately for each tumour stage and all stages combined.During the study period from 2003 to 2014, age-standardised rates for breast cancer were 54.6 and 116.7 per 100,000 for Russia and Germany, respectively. The proportion of the T1 stage at diagnosis among Russian women aged 50\u00a0+ is half than that in Germany. Nevertheless, we observed an increasing trend of early-stage alongside the reduction of advanced-stage incidence rates of breast cancer in Russia.The observed trend in Russia may reflect overall positive changes in early detection of breast cancer, with actual proportion of T1 stage still far behind Germany. Advances in breast cancer screening efforts through the dispanserizatsiya may help to further reduce the breast cancer burden.",
  "The number of elderly patients in Japan with breast cancer has been gradually increasing. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of radiotherapy (RT) after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) for elderly patients with early breast cancer who were restaged according to the 8th Edition Breast Cancer Staging System.We reviewed patients age\u2009\u2265\u200965\u00a0years who received BCS and adjuvant RT or BCS alone for breast cancer between 2010 and 2015 in our institution and restaged those patients using the AJCC 8th edition pathological prognostic staging system. We compared relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates in the RT group and no RT group.A total of 170 patients were eligible for analysis: 94 (55.3%) were treated with RT and 76 (44.7%) were treated without RT. Age (p\u2009<\u20090.01) was associated with the use of RT. Adjuvant RT significantly improved RFS (95.75% vs 84.21%, p\u2009=\u20090.02). There was no significant difference between the OS rates in the two groups. Univariate analysis showed that pathologic T stage and N stage were significantly associated with both RFS and OS and that histologic grade, chemotherapy, HER2, and RT were significantly associated with RFS, but not with OS. RT reduced the risk of recurrence (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.56, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.19-0.96, p\u2009=\u20090.04).RT was associated with significantly improved RFS, but had no significant impact on OS in elderly patients with breast cancer after BCS. Adjuvant RT should be performed even for elderly patients with early breast cancer.",
  "It is important to determine whether anthracycline-containing regimens or taxane-containing regimens are more effective in individual patients. The present study compared the efficacy of six cycles of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (TC6) with that of three cycles of 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel (FEC-D) in Japanese patients with hormone receptor (HR)-negative breast cancer (BC) to identify subtypes requiring anthracycline treatment.The study included 103 patients with operable HR-negative BC. Of these patients 53 received FEC-D and 50 received TC6. The primary endpoint was pathological complete response (pCR). The secondary endpoints were safety, breast-conserving surgery, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). The predictive factors for each regimen were evaluated.Of the 103 patients, 97 completed the study (FEC-D, 50 patients; TC6, 47 patients). The pCR rate was higher with FEC-D (36%) than with TC6 (25.5%); however, the difference was not significant (P\u202f=\u202f0.265). TC6 was safer than FEC-D, as the adverse events with docetaxel in the FEC-D regimen were similar to those with the TC6 regimen. Among patients with basal BC, the pCR rate was significantly higher with FEC-D (42.9%) than with TC6 (13.6%; P\u202f=\u202f0.033). Among patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the DFS and OS were significantly better with FEC-D than with TC6 (P\u202f=\u202f0.016 and P\u202f=\u202f0.034, respectively).TC6 was not as effective as FEC-D for treating HR-negative BC, as TC6 was not sufficient to treat TNBC, particularly the basal subtype. Our findings suggest that anthracyclines are better treatment options than taxanes for basal BC.",
  "Breast cancer survival outcomes vary across different ethnic groups. We clarified the differences in clinicopathological and survival characteristics of breast cancer among Japanese, US residents with Japanese origin (USJ), and US residents with other origins (USO).Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 18 dataset and Japanese Breast Cancer Society (JBCS) registry, we included patients first diagnosed with breast cancer between 2004 and 2015. We categorized the patients into three groups based on the database and the recorded ethnicity: Japanese (all those from the JBCS registry), USJ (those from SEER with ethnicity: Japanese), and USO (those from SEER with ethnicity other than Japanese). Excluding patients diagnosed after 2012, stage 0, and 4 patients, we examined the overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for age, sex, cancer stage, and hormone receptor (HR) status.We identified 7362 USJ, 701,751 USO, and 503,013 Japanese breast cancer patients. The proportion of HR-positive breast cancer was the highest among USJ (71%). OS was significantly longer among Japanese and USJ than USO (Hazard ratio 0.46; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.45-0.47 for Japanese and 0.66 [95% CI 0.59-0.74] for USJ) after adjusting for baseline covariates. BCSS was also significantly higher in the two groups (HR 0.53 [95% CI 0.51-0.55] for Japanese and 0.53 [95% CI 0.52-0.74] for USJ).In stage I-III breast cancer, Japanese and US residents with Japanese origin experienced significantly longer survival than US residents with non-Japanese origins.",
  "Since the publication of the Z0011 trial, practice-changing clinical guidelines for breast surgery have been developed. Although recent studies confirmed the feasibility of the Z0011 strategy in Asian populations, there has been no study on the trends of axillary surgery in Asian cohort. This study aimed to investigate the time trend of axillary surgery for breast cancer from a Korean Breast Cancer Registry to understand the impact of the Z0011 trial in Asian patients.We collected prospectively constructed data from the nationwide Korean Breast Cancer Registry (KBCR). We identified patients who underwent sentinel node biopsy followed by breast-conserving surgery from 2011 to 2018 and were found to have pathological stage T1-2N1-3M0 disease. Regression analyses were performed to compare the downward trend of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in Korean cohort with that previously reported in a Dutch cohort.From KBCR data, 7478 patients met the inclusion criteria. The proportion of ALND significantly decreased from 2011 (76.6%) to 2018 (47.5%). Multivariate analysis revealed that earlier years at diagnosis, larger tumor size, and lymphatic invasion were associated with a higher odds ratio of performing ALND. Compared to the Dutch cohort, the downward trend of ALND in Korea was significantly more gradual (annual percent change: 37.2 vs. 5.8%, p\u2009<\u20090.001).This study demonstrated a downward trend of ALND in Korean patients with breast cancer. However, the rate of decrease was significantly slower than that in the Dutch cohort.",
  "Postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT), as an important regional treatment, improves the survival rate of patients with T3N0M0 breast cancers. However, the therapeutic effect of PMRT on T3N0M0 patients in different age groups is unclear.Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, we identified 4840 T3N0M0 patients between 2000 and 2015. The primary and secondary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS). Survival outcomes were compared using Kaplan-Meier survival test, COX regression analysis, propensity score matching and forest plot, which present the relationship between age and PMRT.Survival analysis demonstrated that for young patients (aged 18-45 and 46-55), there was no significant difference in OS between with and without PMRT. However, for patients older than 65 years, PMRT could significantly improve survival time (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Multivariate Cox analysis of OS showed older patients with PMRT had a lower hazard ratio (HR) than those without PMRT (aged 56-65: HR\u00a0=\u00a00.67, P\u00a0=\u00a00.014; aged >65: HR\u00a0=\u00a00.60, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and little benefit for young patients. The consistent results were also observed in 1:1 matched cohort. Subgroup analysis revealed the survival HRs of with versus without PMRT for patients older than 65 years were significant in most subgroups.The effect of PMRT in T3N0M0 patients is related to the age. PMRT is associated with improved survival in older patients with T3N0M0 breast cancer, especially those older than 65 years. While the benefit of PMRT is limited in T3N0M0 patients of young age. The observation suggests the importance of age for T3N0M0 patients when individualized treatment is made.",
  "To assess if mammographic density (MD) changes during neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment and is predictive of a pathological complete response (pCR).We prospectively included 200 breast cancer patients assigned to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in the NeoDense study (2014-2019). Raw data mammograms were used to assess MD with a fully automated volumetric method and radiologists categorized MD using the Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS), 5th Edition. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) for pCR comparing BI-RADS categories c vs. a, b, and d as well as with a 0.5% change in percent dense volume adjusting for baseline characteristics.The overall median age was 53.1 years, and 48% of study participants were premenopausal pre-NACT. A total of 23% (N\u00a0=\u00a045) of the patients accomplished pCR following NACT. Patients with very dense breasts (BI-RADS d) were more likely to have a positive axillary lymph node status at diagnosis: 89% of the patients with very dense breasts compared to 72% in the entire cohort. A total of 74% of patients decreased their absolute dense volume during NACT. The likelihood of accomplishing pCR following NACT was independent of volumetric MD at diagnosis and change in volumetric MD during treatment. No trend was observed between decreasing density according to BI-RADS and the likelihood of accomplishing pCR following NACT.The majority of patients decreased their MD during NACT. We found no evidence of MD as a predictive marker of pCR in the neoadjuvant setting.",
  "Breast cancer has been one of the last tumor types to see benefit from immunotherapies. Yet, immune infiltrates have been noticed for decades in primary breast cancers. Lately, quantity of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have been reported to have strong prognostic value in improving estimates of distant recurrence-free survival, disease-free and overall survival in early-stage triple negative BC (TNBC) treated with standard adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Level 1B evidence). Quantity, as a percentage of tumor stromal infiltration, is based on an evaluation by pathologists using light microscopy on H&E stained glass slides (see method at www.tilsinbreastcancer.org) [1,2] at time of diagnosis (pre-treatment and in the residual disease post neoadjuvant chemotherapy). Whilst TILs are currently not used for treatment allocation, this is an active area of investigation. Combination of atezolizumab with nab-paclitaxel in a phase III study has recently seen success in terms of improved progression free and overall survival for the PD-L1 -positive population of metastatic TNBC in the first line/newly relapsed setting [3]. This has led to approval of atezolizumab for use in this setting. However, this population was only 41% of the trial population. Data in advanced breast cancer currently suggest requirement for enrichment of the population for preexisting anti-tumor immunity for benefit to PD(L)1 inhibition. Checkpoint inhibitors are currently being investigated in the early-stage setting in a number of phase II/III trials in TNBC with various different anti- PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA-4 agents. In this context, we will face issues of the best chemotherapy backbone, the possible detrimental role of steroids and growth factor support, risk of overtreatment, differences between PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibition and if we can use a biomarker to effectively escalate or de-escalate chemotherapy and/or use checkpoint inhibition in this setting.",
  "The role of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) as a biomarker in non-invasive breast cancer is unclear. This meta-analysis assessed the prognostic impact of TIL levels in patients with non-invasive breast cancer.Systematic literature search was performed to identify studies assessing local recurrence in patients with non-invasive breast cancer according to TIL levels (high vs. low). Subgroup analyses per local recurrence (invasive and non-invasive) were performed. Secondary objectives were the association between TIL levels and non-invasive breast cancer subtypes, age, grade and necrosis. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were extracted from each study and a pooled analysis was conducted with random-effect model.Seven studies (N\u00a0=\u00a03437) were included in the present meta-analysis. High-TILs were associated with a higher likelihood of local recurrence (invasive or non-invasive, N\u00a0=\u00a02941; OR 2.05; 95%CI, 1.03-4.08; p\u00a0=\u00a00.042), although with a lower likelihood of invasive local recurrence (N\u00a0=\u00a01722; OR 0.69; 95%CI, 0.49-0.99; p\u00a0=\u00a00.042). High-TIL levels were associated with triple-negative (OR 3.84; 95%CI, 2.23-6.61; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and HER2-positive (OR 6.27; 95%CI, 4.93-7.97; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) subtypes, high grade (OR 5.15; 95%CI, 3.69-7.19; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and necrosis (OR 3.09; 95%CI, 2.33-4.10; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).High-TIL levels were associated with more aggressive tumours, a higher likelihood of local recurrence (invasive or non-invasive) but a lower likelihood of invasive local recurrence in patients with non-invasive breast cancer.",
  "Breast cancer is one of the most common malignant tumor in women. The high metastatic characteristics cause a high mortality rate of breast cancer. Increasing number of studies have indicated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play key roles in the progression of human cancers including breast cancer. In this study, we studied the expression and molecular mechanisms of lncRNA FOXD3-AS1 in breast cancer.The expression of lncRNA FOXD3-AS1 was analyzed by TCGA database and RT-qPCR assay. CCK8 assay was used to measure cell proliferation ability. Cell migration and invasion capacities were detected by transwell assay. Potential targets of lncRNA and miRNA were predicted by bioinformatic tools. The targeting relationship between genes was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. The nude mice tumor model was performed to study the effect of FOXD3-AS1 on breast cancer in vivo. Protein expression was detected by western blot.In the present study, we found that the FOXD3-AS1 expression was significantly increased in breast cancer tissues compared with normal tissues and involved in the poor prognosis of patients. Functionally, knockdown of FOXD3-AS1 suppressed cell proliferation and metastasis abilities in vitro, and tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, FOXD3-AS1 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to upregulate ARF6 expression by targeting miR-127-3p. In addition, the roles of FOXD3-AS1 on cell proliferation and metastasis were achieved through miR-127-3p/ARF6 axis.In summary, our results reported the regulatory mechanism of FOXD3-AS1 in breast cancer progression by targeting miR-127-3p/ARF6 axis to affect cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor growth.",
  "The 21-gene assay provides prognostication for estrogen receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (ER+/HER2-) early female breast cancer patients. This signature has not been validated in male breast cancer (MBC).A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed in accordance to the PRISMA guidelines. Retrospective cohort studies comparing 21-gene assay scores in female and MBC were included. Dichotomous variables were pooled as odds ratios (OR) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the Mantel-Haenszel method.Six studies including 176,338 patients were included (mean age of 63.4 years, range: 33-88). Of these, 1.0% had MBC (1826/176,338) and 99.0% were female patients (174,512/176,338). MBC patients were more likely to have increased tumour stage, nodal involvement, and grade 3 disease (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) In MBC patients, the mean score was 18.8 (range: 11-26) vs. 13.4 (range 0-33) in female patients (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In MBC patients, 22.4% had scores >30 (408/1822) versus 18.3% in female patients (31,852/174,500). In female patients, 52.0% had scores <18 (90,787/174,500) versus 47.8% in MBC (471/1822). Overall, patients with female patients were as likely to have scores <18 (OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.94-1.16), scores 18-30 (OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.00-1.26) and scores >30 (OR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.45-1.07) as MBC patients.There are similar anticipated scores for female and MBC undergoing 21-gene expression assay testing for early stage, ER+/HER2-breast cancer. In the absence of stage matching, cautious interpretation of these results is required. Validation of the 21-gene assay in MBC is still required.",
  "Limited research exists exploring the experience of living with advanced breast cancer in Indonesia. We sought to explore the narratives of women with breast cancer across the illness trajectory to understand their experiences from diagnosis to accessing and undergoing cancer treatments to inform the development of cancer care.A nested, exploratory study adopting a qualitative approach. We conducted in-depth face-to-face interviews with women living with advanced breast cancer in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. We purposively sampled participants by age, education and marital status. All interviews were transcribed verbatim with thematic analysis used to identify, analyse and report patterns and themes within the data.Four main themes were derived: 1) Early experiences, prior to accessing health care; 2) Navigating the system to access treatment; 3) Enduring chemotherapy and advancing disease, with crucial family support; 4) Seeking normalcy and belief in treatment. From initial symptoms through to undergoing treatments, the experience of participants was punctuated by barriers and challenges.Presentation delays were driven by dismissing initial symptoms, seeking alternative medicines, and fear of surgery. Access to healthcare required participants to contend with long-distance travel to facilities, tiered and convoluted referral processes, and adverse effects and financial impact of treatments. Individual determination, belief in God, and the role of families were critical throughout the disease trajectory. Adopting a focus across the disease trajectory facilitated the identification of enduring and persistent challenges to care delivery that can inform targeted development and optimisation of care delivery for women with breast cancer.",
  "To explore the clinicopathological features and prognosis of breast cancer with special histological types.The information of breast cancer patients was obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (2010-2016). Comparative analyses were performed to explore the difference in clinicopathological characteristics and propensity score matching (PSM) was used to weaken the effects from clinical profiles. Survival analysis was conducted to investigate the prognostic effects from histological types, and the prognostic factors of this group of patients were identified with the univariate COX proportional model.A total of 242863 breast cancer patients were eligible, of which 230213 individuals were ductal breast cancer (IDC) and 12650 individuals were special breast lesions, respectively. Comparatively, special breast cancer had a lower histological grade, a smaller tumor size, a lower proportion of nodal involvement and distant metastasis, in addition to a higher proportion of triple-negative subtype. The overall prognosis of special histological breast cancer was comparable to IDC, while the survival of HER2 enriched breast cancer was in favor of special breast cancer. With the PSM performance, the prognosis exhibited an inferior profile in the metaplastic breast cancer and was significantly favorable to apocrine, medullary, micropapillary, and papillary breast cancer.This study revealed that the special histological breast cancer presented distinct clinicopathological characteristics and great heterogeneity in the prognosis among diverse histological subtypes.",
  "This report describes the rationale, purpose and design of A011801 (CompassHER2 RD), an ongoing prospective, multicenter, Phase III randomized trial. Eligible patients in the United States (US) and Canada with high-risk (defined as ER-negative and/or node-positive) HER2-positive (HER2+) residual disease (RD) after a predefined course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and HER2-directed treatment\u00a0are randomized 1:1 to adjuvant T-DM1 and placebo, versus\u00a0T-DM1 and tucatinib. Patients have\u00a0also received adjuvant radiotherapy and/or endocrine therapy, if indicated per standard of care guidelines. The primary objective of the trial is to determine if the invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) with T-DM1 plus tucatinib is superior to iDFS with T-DM1 plus placebo; other outcomes of interest include overall survival (OS), breast cancer-free survival (BCFS), distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS), brain metastases-free survival (BMFS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Correlative biomarker, quality of life (QoL)\u00a0and pharmacokinetic (PK) end points are also\u00a0evaluated.",
  "Metaplastic breast cancer (MBC) is a rare and aggressive form of breast cancer. The effectiveness of chemotherapy (CT) for MBC remains controversial. The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of CT combined hormone receptor (HR) status on MBC patients with high risk (T1-4N2-3M0 and T4N0-1M0) by propensity-score matching (PSM).A retrospective study was performed to analyze MBC from the SEER database. Breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier curve. Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess BCSS. PSM was used to make 1:1 case-control matching.This study identified 3116 patients. The median follow-up time was 44 months (range, 1-321 months). About 62.5\u00a0% of patients received CT. 23.0\u00a0% of patients were HR-positive. Recurrence risk had a significant difference between the HR-negative and HR-positive groups. In the multivariable Cox regression model, CT had no benefit for MBC patients. HR status was not associated with a better prognosis. In subgroup analysis, the Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that HR-negative MBC with intermediate-risk benefited from CT. For HR-positive MBC, patients with intermediate and high risk also benefited from CT. After PSM, neither CT nor HR status was not related to better BCSS. Moreover, the use of CT could only improve the survival of HR-positive MBC patients with high risk.PSM analysis showed that HR status was not associated with a better prognosis. CT was not a significant prognostic factor for prognosis. However, HR-positive MBC patients with high risk might benefit from CT.",
  "Locoregional therapy at primary or secondary sites in breast cancer may be associated with improved survival as compared to systemic therapy alone. We explored the sociodemographic and clinicopathologic factors associated with the use of radiation versus surgical resection of metastatic sites (metastasectomy) in patients with de novo stage IV breast cancer, followed by the associated overall survival.We sampled the National Cancer Database for patients with de novo stage IV breast cancer, (2010-2017) and described cohort's characteristics using univariate analyses. We identified 5 subgroups based on malignant site involvement: 1. Bone only, 2. Brain only, 3. Liver only, 4. Lung only, and 5. Metastasis involving >1 site. Kaplan-Meier modeling with log-rank testing and multivariate Cox Regression analysis were used to explore differences in overall survival between those that received radiation at secondary sites and those that underwent metastasectomy.N\u00a0=\u00a022,749patients were included in this analysis. Radiation (81.2%) was used more commonly than metastasectomy (28.8%). Metastasectomy was associated with better median overall survival across all 5 cohorts (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001), with the survival benefit being the most pronounced with lung only (OS: 56.9 months; HR 0.8, 95% CI 0.7-0.9, p\u00a0=\u00a0.032), or liver only (OS: 41.6 months; HR: 0.9; 95% CI: 0.7-1.1, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) metastasis.Metastasectomy in patients with de novo stage IV breast cancer may be associated with improved overall survival as compared to radiation of secondary lesions, particularly in those with only liver or lung involvement. Prospective randomized controlled trials investigating surgical resection of metastatic sites in patients with breast cancer are warranted.",
  "There is a controversy about late-onset congestive heart failure (CHF) among breast cancer survivors. This study investigated the incidence rate and risk factors of late-onset CHF more than 2\u00a0years after the breast cancer diagnosis.A nationwide, retrospective study was conducted with the National Health Information Database. With 1:3 age- and sex-matched noncancer controls, Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to analyze the incidence and risk factors of late CHF. The cumulative incidence rate of late CHF was evaluated with a Kaplan-Meier analysis and a log-rank test.A total of 91,227 cases (286,480 person-years) and 273,681 controls (884,349 person-years) were evaluated between January 2007 and December 2013. The risks of late CHF were higher in cases than controls (hazard ratio [HR], 1.396; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.268-1.538). Younger survivors (age\u00a0\u2264\u00a050\u00a0years) showed a higher risk of late CHF than their younger counterparts (HR, 2.903; 95% CI, 2.425-3.474). Although older age was a risk factor for late CHF, older survivors (age\u00a0\u2265\u00a066\u00a0years) showed no difference in the risk of late CHF in comparison with their counterparts (HR, 0.906; 95% CI, 0.757-1.084). Anthracyclines and taxanes were risk factors for late CHF, although trastuzumab, radiation, and endocrine therapy were not.Young breast cancer survivors have a greater risk of late CHF than the young population without cancer. More attention should be paid to young breast cancer survivors who receive taxane- or anthracycline-based regimens over the long term.",
  "We aimed to investigate the role of dual-phase FDG PET/CT in predicting the prognosis of patients with operable breast cancer.We retrospectively reviewed the data of 998 patients who underwent radical treatment for breast cancer. Before treatment, PET/CT scans were performed 1 and 2\u00a0h after FDG administration. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) at both time points (SUVmax1 and SUVmax2) in the primary tumor and the retention index (RI) were calculated. PET recurrence risk (PET-RR) was determined based on the SUVmax1 and RI, and disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated according to the metabolic parameters. Propensity score matching was performed to adjust for biological characteristics.The cut-off values for SUVmax1 and RI were 3 and 5%, respectively. The 5-year DFS was 94.9% and 86.1% (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and the 5-year OS was 97.6% and 92.7% (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in the low and high PET-RR groups, respectively. In multivariate analysis, high T status, nodal metastasis, the triple-negative subtype, and high PET-RR were independent factors of poor DFS. Propensity score matching revealed similar findings (5-year DFS 91.8% vs. 88.6%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.041 and 5-year OS 97.1% vs. 94.2%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.240, respectively).The combined parameters of SUVmax1 and RI on dual-phase FDG PET/CT were useful for predicting prognosis of patients with breast cancer. Patients with a high SUVmax1 and a negative time course of FDG uptake had a favorable prognosis.",
  "The ARID family is a superfamily of 15 members containing a domain that interacts with AT-rich DNA elements. However, the expression and prognostic roles of each ARID in breast cancer are still elusive. We used the TCGA and Kaplan-Meier plotter databases to assess the expression and prognostic values of ARID mRNA levels in breast cancer respectively. In the present study, 6 members were significantly lower in tumor tissues than those in the normal tissues, while 6 members were significantly higher. Further assessment of ARID expression in breast cancer with different molecular subtypes, 3 members were significantly higher in no-luminal molecular subtype than those in the luminal molecular subtype, and 6 members were significantly higher. In regard to prognostic values, high expression of ARID1A, ARID2, ARID3B, ARID4A, ARID5A, ARID5B, JARID1A were associated with favorable outcome, while ARID4B and JARID1B were correlated to a worse outcome. We further analyzed the prognostic value of ARID in different intrinsic subtypes and clinicopathological features of breast cancer. We found many meaningful ARID family biomarkers in breast cancer. The relevant results will expound the role of ARID in breast cancer and may further provide new insight to explore the ARID-targeting reagents for treating breast cancer patients.",
  "Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) low breast cancer was considered as a distinct subtype different from HER2-zero breast cancer. Our study aimed to investigate the prognostic values of clinicopathological features and recurrence score (RS) in HER2-low and HER2-zero hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer patients.A total of 2099 HR\u2009+\u2009primary female breast cancer patients diagnosed between Jan 2009 and Jan 2019 were collected. Tumors with immunohistochemistry 1\u2009+\u2009/2\u2009+\u2009and negative in situ hybridization results were defined as HER2-low. We compared the clinical and genetical features of HER2-low (n\u2009=\u20091732) and HER2-zero (n\u2009=\u2009367) breast cancer and their prognostic values.Estrogen receptor (ER) high expression (>\u200990%) was more common in HER2-low breast cancer than HER2-zero breast cancer (78.2% vs 58.6%, p\u2009<\u20090.01). Five-year disease-free survival (DFS) was similar between HER2-zero and HER2-low subgroups (92.3% vs 93.3%, p\u2009=\u20090.83). The predictive value of RS was only significant in HER2-zero patients (p\u2009=\u20090.03). The proliferation-related genes performed well in predicting DFS in HER2-zero patients, but not in HER2-low patients (p for interaction\u2009<\u20090.01). The higher HER2 module score was correlated with worse DFS only in HER2-low patients (p\u2009=\u20090.04).We observed similar survival outcomes between HER2-low and HER2-zero HR\u2009+\u2009patients. HER2-low patients had a higher proportion of ER high expressed tumors than HER2-zero patients did. RS and its proliferation module might be less clinically meaningful to HER2-low patients.",
  "Validation of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores as prognostic factors of acute coronary events (ACE) development in breast cancer patients are demanded. We investigated prognostic impact of CAC on ACE development with cardiac exposure to radiation.We evaluated breast cancer patients with (n\u00a0=\u00a0511) or without (n\u00a0=\u00a0600) adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) between 2005 and 2013. CAC Agatston scores were analyzed using a deep-learning-based algorithm. Individual mean heart dose (MHD) was calculated, and no RT was categorized as 0\u00a0Gy. The primary endpoint was the development of ACE following breast surgery.In the RT and no-RT cohorts, 11.2% and 3.7% exhibited CAC >0, respectively. Over a 9.3-year follow-up period, the 10-year ACE rate was 0.7%. In the multivariate analysis, the CAC score was a significant risk factor for ACE (CAC >0 vs CAC\u00a0=\u00a00, 10-year 6.2% vs 0.2%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In the subgroup with CAC >0, the 10-year ACE rates were 0%, 3.7%, and 13.7% for patients receiving mean heart doses of 0\u00a0Gy, 0-3\u00a0Gy, and >3\u00a0Gy, respectively (P\u00a0=\u00a00.133). Although CAC score was not predictive for non-ACE heart disease risk (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05), the 10-year non-ACE heart disease rates were 1.7%, 5.7%, and 7.1% for patients with CAC\u00a0=\u00a00 receiving MHD of 0\u00a0Gy, 0-3\u00a0Gy, and >3\u00a0Gy, respectively (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).The CAC score was a significant predictor of ACE in patients with breast cancer. Although further studies are required, CAC score screening on simulation CT in patients undergoing breast RT can help identify those with high risk for ACE on a per-patient basis.",
  "and purpose: Radiation recall dermatitis is an adverse event predominantly due to systemic therapy administration after a previous radiation therapy course. Few case reports describe radiation recall dermatitis in breast cancer patients treated with postoperative radiation therapy following COVID-19 vaccination. In this study we investigated the incidence and severity of radiation recall dermatitis after COVID-19 vaccination in irradiated breast cancer patients.Patients that received at least one COVID-19 vaccination dose during the year after the end of postoperative breast radiation therapy were included in this observational monocentric study. Local symptoms occurring inside the radiation field after vaccination were patient-reported and scored according to the PRO-CTCAE questionnaire. Descriptive data of radiation recall dermatitis incidence and severity, and potential risk factors were evaluated.A cohort of 361 patients with 756 administered COVID-19 vaccinations was analyzed. Breast symptoms were reported by 7.5% of patients, while radiation recall dermatitis was considered for 5.5%. The incidence of radiation recall dermatitis per single dose of vaccine was 2.6%, with a higher risk for the first dose compared to the second/third (4.4% vs 1%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), especially when administered within the first month after the end of irradiation (12.5% vs 2.2%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0004). Local symptoms were generally self-limited and a few cases required anti-inflammatory drugs.Radiation recall dermatitis is an uncommon but not rare phenomenon in breast cancer patients that received COVID-19 vaccination within one year after breast irradiation. However, symptoms severity were generally low/mild and reversible. These findings can be useful for patient counseling.",
  "To evaluate the epidemiology of male breast cancer (MBC) in Italy and to describe incidence and survival data in relation to age, morphology, year of incidence, geographic area, and possible association with other cancers compared with female BC.Cases were extracted from 40 Italian Cancer Registries. Standardized incidence rates (SIR), age-specific rates, and 5-year survival were calculated. The association with second tumors was also evaluated. All data were compared with data from female BCs.In the 2000-2014 period, 2175 new cases of MBC were registered, with an SIR of 1.7\u2009\u00d7\u2009100,000. The incidence showed a slight upward trend and increased with increasing age. The 5-year survival was 82% in the first two periods (2000-2004, 2005-2009), lower than in females (87%). The most frequent morphology was the ductal carcinoma (84%). Stage at diagnosis was 39.5% stage I, 33.1% stage II, 20.9% in stage III, and 6.4% in stage IV. Concerning receptor status, 96.4% had ER+ and 82.5% PR+; 46.5% had high Ki67 and 14.7% HER2 amplified. The risk of BC increased if the man had already had a previous tumor in any site (excess absolute risk, EAR\u2009=\u20092.7) and especially if he had had prostate cancer (EAR\u2009=\u20095.1). Instead, males with a previous diagnosis of BC had an increased risk of testicular, kidney and lung cancer.MBC requires more attention in terms of diagnosis and treatment as clinicians tend to follow the guidelines that have been developed for female BC management.",
  "People with metastatic breast cancer face many challenges and disparities in obtaining optimal cancer care. These challenges are accentuated in underserved patient populations across Europe, who are less likely to receive quality healthcare for reasons including socioeconomic inequalities, educational or cultural status, or geographic location. While there are many local and national initiatives targeted to address these challenges, there remains a need to reduce disparities and improve access to healthcare to improve outcomes, with a focus on multidisciplinary stakeholder engagement. In October 2019, a range of experts in metastatic breast cancer, including healthcare professionals, patient representatives, policymakers and politicians, met to discuss and prioritize the critical needs of underserved patient populations with metastatic breast cancer in Europe. Six key challenges faced by these communities were identified: the need for amplification of the metastatic breast cancer patient voice, better and wider implementation of high-quality guidelines for metastatic breast cancer, more collaboration between stakeholders, tailored support for patients from different cultural and ethnic backgrounds, improved data sharing, and work-related issues. The Expert Panel then conceived and discussed potential actionable goals to address each key challenge. Their conclusions present a set of interrelated approaches to address the different challenges and could serve as the basis for concerted improvement of the lives of patients with metastatic breast cancer in Europe.",
  "Breast conserving surgery (BCS) is associated with unsatisfactory cosmetic outcomes in up to 30% of patients, carrying psychological and quality-of-life implications. This study compares long-term cosmetic outcomes after BCS for breast cancer with v without simple oncoplastic defect closure.A randomised controlled trial was performed, recruiting patients who underwent BCS over four years and randomising to the \"reshaping\" group (closure of excision defect with mobilised breast tissue; n\u00a0=\u00a0124) and to the \"control\" group (no attempt at defect closure; n\u00a0=\u00a0109). The estimated excision volume (EEV) was <20% of breast volume (BV) in both groups. Photography and breast retraction assessment (BRA) were recorded preoperatively. Cosmetic outcomes were blindly assessed annually for five years by BRA, panel assessment of patients, and body image questionnaire (BIQ).There were no significant differences between the reshaping and control groups in mean age (52.4 v 53.0; p\u00a0=\u00a00.63), body mass index (27.8 v 27.7; p\u00a0=\u00a00.80), margin re-excision (9 v 9; p\u00a0=\u00a00.78), mean BV (562.5 v 590.3\u00a0cc; p\u00a0=\u00a00.56), mean EEV (54.6 v 60.1\u00a0cc; p\u00a0=\u00a00.14), mean EEV/BV ratio (11.2 v 11.0; p\u00a0=\u00a00.84), or mean specimen weight (52.1 v 57.7\u00a0g; p\u00a0=\u00a00.24). Reshaping group patients had significantly better outcomes compared to control group patients in terms of mean BRA (0.9 v 2.8; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), achieving a score of \"good\" or \"excellent\" by panel assessment at 5 years (75.8% v 48%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), body image questionnaire top score at 5 years (66.9% v 35.8%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001).Simple oncoplastic closure of defects after breast-conserving surgery improves long-term objective and subjective cosmetic outcomes.",
  "Since it is thought that breast adipose tissue could influence breast cancer clinical presentation, we wanted to characterize specifically the relationship between breast adipose tissue fatty acid profile and Inflammatory Breast cancer (IBC).Two hundred thirty-four women presenting with breast cancer were managed in our centre between January 2009 and December 2011. Breast adipose tissue specimens were collected during breast surgery. We established the biochemical profile of adipose tissue fatty acids (FA) by gas chromatography and assessed whether there were differences in function of the presence of breast inflammation or not.We found that IBC was associated with decreased levels in breast adipose tissue of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), one of the two main polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) of marine origin, but also with decreased levels of Gamma Linolenic acid (GLA). Inversely, an increase in palmitic acid levels was associated with IBC.These differences in lipid content may contribute to the occurrence of breast cancer inflammation.",
  "We evaluated the prognostic ability of immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based vs. PAM50-based subtypes for breast cancer mortality in a population-based study of breast cancer.We included a total of 463 breast cancer cases from the population-based Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project (LIBCSP). IHC-based markers were abstracted from the medical records, while the PAM50-based intrinsic subtypes were assessed from tumor tissues using NanoString nCounter<sup>\u00ae</sup> Analysis System. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazards ratios (HRs) for breast cancer-specific mortality associated with subtypes.For IHC-based hormone receptor-positive (HR+) tumors (n\u2009=\u2009361), 68.7% were classified as luminal subtypes by PAM50; for HR- tumors (n\u2009=\u2009102), 95.1% were classified as non-luminal subtypes. Compared to HR+/HER2- subtype, HR- patients had significantly higher breast cancer mortality (HR-/HER2+: HR\u2009=\u20092.84, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.58-5.11; triple-negative breast cancer: HR\u2009=\u20092.42, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.44-4.06). Compared to luminal A, a higher mortality rate was observed for all other PAM50-based subtypes: luminal B (HR\u2009=\u20094.03, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.97-8.22), HER2-enriched (HR\u2009=\u20096.82, 95% CI\u2009=\u20093.29-14.14) and basal-like (HR\u2009=\u20094.71, 95% CI\u2009=\u20092.24-9.93). Additional subtyping of HR+ patients by PAM50 provided future risk stratification where luminal B patients in this group had significant higher mortality than luminal A patients (HR\u2009=\u20093.93, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.92-8.03). Similar results were also observed among 291 HR+/HER2- patients, but not among the HR- patients.Our study suggests that for HR+ patients, especially HR+/HER2- patients, additional PAM50-based subtyping would provide better prognostic stratification and improve disease management.",
  "There have been very few reports of secondary malignancies after breast cancer treatment in Asia, particularly in Japan. This study aimed to evaluate the risk of secondary malignancies after radiotherapy (RT) in Japanese breast cancer patients.This single-center retrospective study included patients who underwent RT between July 1961 and September 2006 for postoperative breast cancer. A total of 702 patients with a follow-up period of more than 5\u00a0years were analyzed. All malignancies observed at more than 5\u00a0years after the start of RT were defined as secondary malignancies. To calculate the relative risk (RR) of secondary malignancies, we applied data from the National Cancer Center in Japan.The median observation period was 9.7 (interquartile range 7.1-18.2) years. The cumulative person-years of observation were 6879.4. The RR of contralateral breast cancer increased by 1.85-fold (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-3.26) among patients compared with that among the general population; however, the difference was not significant (p\u2009=\u20090.053). The RR of secondary malignancies other than breast cancer increased by 2.71-fold (95% CI 1.99-3.70, p\u2009<\u20090.001) among the patients compared with the general population. Even when only malignancies detected more than 10\u00a0years after RT were defined as secondary malignancies, the RR of secondary malignancies other than breast cancer was 1.91 (95% CI 1.33-2.73, p\u2009<\u20090.001).The incidence of secondary malignancies after RT may be somewhat higher in Japanese patients with breast cancer than in the general population.",
  "To evaluate whether uPA/PAI-1 protein in hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast tumor can predict prognosis in early breast cancer (BC).606 women with HR\u00a0+\u00a0BC who had \u22655 years of endocrine therapy and in whom tumor tissue was available were included in this analysis. Stromal uPA/PAI-1 protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and correlated with distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) and overall survival (OS).Stromal uPA was detected in 292/538 tumors (54.3%) while 269/505 samples (53.3%) exhibited stromal PAI-1. Co-expression of both proteins was found in 163/437 (37.3%) samples. Stromal uPA/PAI-1 co-expression was not associated with tumor size, age, nodal status, grading, or receptor status. Tumor stroma with both uPA and PAI-1 protein expression were more likely to have a shorter DRFS (HR: 1.87; 95%CI 1.18-2.96; p\u202f=\u202f0.007) and OS (HR: 1.29; 95%CI 0.93-1.80; p\u202f=\u202f0.129) than women without uPA/PAI-1 co-expression. After a median follow-up of 10 years, women with uPA/PAI-1-positive tumors experienced a significantly shorter DRFS (86.5% vs 72.4%; p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and OS (70.4% vs 58.9%; p\u202f=\u202f0.020) compared to women with uPA/PAI-1 negative tumors.Stromal co-expression of uPA and PAI-1 in breast cancer predicts poor DRFS and OS in postmenopausal women with HR\u00a0+\u00a0early-stage BC who receive endocrine therapy.",
  "To investigate the effectiveness and safety of bevacizumab-paclitaxel combination therapy as first- or second-line chemotherapy for HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in daily clinical practice.In this prospective multicenter observational study, bevacizumab-paclitaxel was administered at the discretion of attending physicians. Cohorts\u00a0A and B had hormone receptor-positive and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), respectively. Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Multivariate analyses were conducted to identify prognostic factors.Between November 2012 and October 2014, 767 patients were enrolled from 155 institutions across Japan. Effectiveness was analyzed in 754 eligible patients (cohort\u00a0A, 539; cohort\u00a0B, 215) and safety in 750 treated patients (median observation period, 19.7\u00a0months). Median OS (95% CI) was 21.7 (19.8-23.6) months in eligible patients; 25.2 (22.4-27.4) months and 13.2 (11.3-16.6) months in cohorts\u00a0A and B, respectively; and 24.4 (21.9-27.2) months and 17.6 (15.2-20.0) months in patients receiving first- and second-line therapy, respectively. Factors affecting OS (hazard ratio 95% CI) were TNBC (1.75, 1.44-2.14), second-line therapy (1.35, 1.13-1.63), ECOG performance status\u2009\u2265\u20091 (1.28, 1.04-1.57), taxane-based chemotherapy (0.65, 0.49-0.86), cancer-related symptoms (0.56, 0.46-0.68), and visceral metastasis (0.52, 0.40-0.66). Incidences of grade\u2009\u2265\u20093 AEs hypertension, neutropenia, peripheral neuropathy, proteinuria, and bleeding were 35.7%, 27.2%, 7.2%, 3.7%, and 0.3%, respectively.In Japanese clinical practice, combined bevacizumab-paclitaxel was as effective as in previous studies. Factors that independently predicted poor prognosis in the present study are consistent with those identified previously.Trial no. UMIN000009086.",
  "The prognostic impact of postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) on contemporary older patients with T1-2N1 breast cancer is unclear. We aimed to investigate the effect of PMRT in this setting.Leveraging the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program data from 2004 to 2015, 7052 patients aged 70 years or older with T1-2N1 breast cancer were identified for this propensity-matched analysis. Fine and Gray competing risks regression was conducted to explore the correlation between PMRT and breast cancer-specific survival, in subgroups defined by tumor size and positive lymph nodes.The median follow-up was 60.1 months (interquartile range, 28.0 to 87.0). Among propensity-matched patients, multivariate analysis identified an association between PMRT and decreased breast cancer mortality (BCM; HR 0.637; 95\u00a0% CI 0.436-0.931; P\u00a0=\u00a00.020) in patient subset with three positive nodes and tumors 2-5\u00a0cm in size, and this benefit was limited to patients with three positive nodes and tumors 2-5\u00a0cm in size who did not receive chemotherapy. In patient subsets who received chemotherapy, no association between PMRT and BCM was found.PMRT was not associated with BCM in older patients with T1-2N1 breast cancer who received chemotherapy. The benefit of PMRT was limited to those with three positive nodes and tumors 2-5\u00a0cm in size who did not receive chemotherapy.",
  "The DESTINY-Breast04 clinical trial is currently investigating whether trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is effective in HER2-low as well as HER2-positive breast cancer. This highlights the interest in treatment strategies for patients with HER2-low breast cancer. The current study was therefore designed to determine the frequency of HER2-low among all breast cancers, and to compare the prognosis of HER2-low patients with that of HER2-negative patients.We retrospectively reviewed the biological data from 4,918 of 4,977 primary breast cancer patients who attended our institute. We quantified the overall frequency of breast cancer patients with a new HER2-low subtype that was defined by an immunohistochemistry score of IHC1\u2009+\u2009or IHC2\u2009+\u2009/ISH-. We then compared the clinical characteristics and prognosis of HER2-low patients with that of patients who did not have HER2 amplification (HER2-0).Low HER2 expression was found in 3169 (64.4%) patients; 2860 (58.1%) were HR-positive and 309 (6.3%) were HR-negative. Among HER2-0 patients, 681 (13.9%) were HR-positive and 157 (3.2%) were HR-negative. The HER2-0 group tended to have more poor prognostic factors than the HER2-low group, irrespective of HR status. There were no statistically significant differences between the prognosis of HER2-low and HER2-0 patients, regardless of HR status. However, patients in the HER2-low group tended to have better prognosis than those in the HER2-0 group.HER2-low patients did not have a significantly different prognosis than HER2-0 patients, regardless of HR status. However, we should consider tailoring therapies for patients with HRE2-low early breast cancer according to their HR status.",
  "Despite marked progress in outcomes for women with early stage breast cancer, unmet challenges persist. These include accounting for the cohort of tumors that do not have favorable clinical outcomes related to tumor heterogeneity, particularly the variation within the subset of ER positive breast cancer; better treatments for subsets where existing therapies are not fully effective; and the development of biomarkers to predict response or need for ongoing treatment. Beyond these tumor-related factors, there is persistent need for focus on improving the patient's experience of treatment - avoiding unnecessary therapy, and providing better supportive care so as to minimize side effects and social and economic disruption caused by treatment. For clinical investigators, the improved prognosis for early stage breast cancer has meant that large sample sizes of subjects are needed for prospective clinical trials with cancer outcome endpoints. As a consequence, the scale of clinical research enterprises has become enormous, too often unsupportable without industry or government resources. Finally, as breast cancer is a global health concern, there is an urgent need to assure that screening and treatment are available to women around the world so that the progress achieved in developed countries can reach billions of women everywhere on earth.",
  "Guided by a national cancer plan (2010-19), Morocco made significant investments in improving breast cancer detection and treatment. A breast cancer pattern-of-care study was conducted to document the socio-demographic profiles of patients and tumour characteristics, measure delays in care, and assess the status of dissemination and impact of state-of-the-art management. The retrospective study conducted among 2120 breast cancer patients registered during 2008-17\u00a0at the two premier-most oncology centres (Centre Mohammed VI or CM-VI and Institut National d'Oncologie or INO) also measured temporal trends of the different variables. Median age (49 years) and other socio-demographic characteristics of the patients remained constant over time. A significant improvement in coverage of the state-financed health insurance scheme for indigent populations was observed over time. Median interval between onset of symptoms and first medical consultation was 6 months with a significant reduction over time. Information on staging and molecular profile were available for more than 90% and 80% of the patients respectively. Approximately 55% of the patients presented at stage I/II and proportion of triple-negative cancers was 16%; neither showing any appreciable temporal variation. Treatment information was available for more than 90% of the patients; 69% received surgery with chemotherapy and/or radiation. Treatment was tailored to stage and molecular profiles, though breast conservation therapy was offered to less than one-fifth. When compared using the EUSOMA quality indicators for breast cancer management, INO performed better than CM-VI. This was reflected in nearly 25% difference in 5-year disease-free survival for early-stage cancers between the centres.",
  "The tumour microenvironment has been shown to be a valuable source of prognostic information for different cancer types. This holds in particular for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), a breast cancer subtype for which currently no prognostic biomarkers are established. Although different methods to assess tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have been published, it remains unclear which method (marker, region) yields the most optimal prognostic information. In addition, to date, no objective TILs assessment methods are available. For this proof of concept study, a subset of our previously described TNBC cohort (n\u00a0=\u00a094) was stained for CD3, CD8 and FOXP3 using multiplex immunohistochemistry and subsequently imaged by a multispectral imaging system. Advanced whole-slide image analysis algorithms, including convolutional neural networks (CNN) were used to register unmixed multispectral images and corresponding H&E sections, to segment the different tissue compartments (tumour, stroma) and to detect all individual positive lymphocytes. Densities of positive lymphocytes were analysed in different regions within the tumour and its neighbouring environment and correlated to relapse free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). We found that for all TILs markers the presence of a high density of positive cells correlated with an improved survival. None of the TILs markers was superior to the others. The results of TILs assessment in the various regions did not show marked differences between each other. The negative correlation between TILs and survival in our cohort are in line with previous studies. Our results provide directions for optimizing TILs assessment methodology.",
  "The pre-treatment neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been reported to be a predictive factor for pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in breast cancer patients. However, whether the dynamic change of post-treatment neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (delta-NLR) can better predict the same outcome remains unclear.We retrospectively analyzed 242 consecutive patients affected by breast cancer and candidates of NACT. The complete blood cell counts before and after NACT were evaluated to calculate NLR. The relationships between delta-NLR and pCR, along with other clinical-pathological characteristics were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using a logistic regression model.Of the 242 patients, 65 (26.9%) achieved a pCR. Pre-treatment NLR and post-treatment NLR were not significantly associated with pCR if analyzed separately in multivariate analyses. However, when combining together, patients with delta-NLR\u2009<\u20090 profile achieved a significantly higher rate of pCR compared to those with delta-NLR\u2009\u2265\u20090 (OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.35-5.96, p\u2009=\u20090.006). Additionally, the predictive value of delta-NLR was independent from common prognostic factors such as Ki-67, and molecular subtypes.Delta-NLR, rather than pre-treatment or post-treatment NLR is associated with pCR rate, suggesting that the dynamic change of NLR may be an important factor predicting the response to NACT in breast cancer patients.",
  "The purpose of this study is to confirm the position of DBT in breast cancer screening in Japan, to assess cancer detection rates, recall rates, positive predictive value (PPV), and to evaluate the type of mammographic findings of cancer with the use of digital mammography alone (2DDM) and combined with digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT).11,894 examinations of the opportunistic breast cancer screening using only 2DDM and 2DDM plus DBT were performed from May 1, 2017 to March 31, 2019. The 11,894 women [3535 women who received DBT in addition to 2DDM (3D group) and 8359 who received 2DDM only (2D group)] participated in this study. The study was approved by the Institute's Ethics Committee and all participants provided written informed consent.The recall rate was 2.6% for the 3D group and 3.6% for the 2D group (p\u2009<\u20090.01). The cancer detection rate was 0.17% in both 3D and 2D groups (p\u2009=\u20090.978). The positive predictive value (PPV) was 6.5% for the 3D group and 4.7% for the 2D group (p\u2009=\u20090.484). The cause of the decrease in recall rate was due to a decrease in the finding of focal asymmetric density (FAD).The recall rate was improved by using DBT for breast cancer screening in Japanese women. Cancer detection rates were exactly the same in DBT and 2DDM groups, so only DBT non-inferiority could be verified. We have verified that breast cancer screening combined with DBT is useful even for Japanese women to reduce unnecessary further examination.",
  "Risk-stratified breast cancer screening may improve the balance of screening benefits to harms. We assess a potential new harm: reduced screening attendance in women receiving below average-risk (false reassurance) or higher-risk results (screening avoidance). Following initial screening, 26,668 women in the PROCAS study received breast cancer risk estimates, with attendance recorded for two subsequent screening rounds. First-screen attendance was slightly reduced in below-average (85.6%) but not higher-risk women, compared to other women (86.4%). Second-screen attendance increased for women at higher-risk (89.2%) but not below-average, compared to other women (78.8%). Concerns about this potential harm of risk-stratified screening therefore appear unfounded.",
  "<b>Introduction</b>: Incidence and mortality rates of breast cancer are increasing in women worldwide. Immunotherapy is a relatively popular treatment modality for all malignant tumors including breast cancer in recent years. Interferon \u03b3-inducible protein 30 (IFI30) could catalyze the reduction of disulfide bonds and enhance major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-restricted antigen processing. Recent studies showed that IFI30 played an important role in the immune response of malignant tumors. <b>Methods</b>: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and clinical proteomic tumor Analysis consortium (CPTAC) database were applied to predict the role of IFI30 in breast cancer and the relationship between IFI30 and prognosis of breast cancer patients. Then we detected the expression of IFI30 in clinical samples of breast cancer patients, and analyzed the relationship between IFI30 and the prognosis of breast cancer patients. We used lentivirus infection method to construct a stable IFI30 knockdown cell line, and detected the effect of IFI30 in breast cancer cells. Nude mice tumor bearing experiment was performed to investigate the effect of IFI30 on breast cancer cells <i>in vivo</i>. Western blot was used to verify the regulation of autophagy related protein LC3 and p62 by IFI30. <b>Results:</b> We found that IFI30 was highly expressed in breast cancer tissues and was associated with poor outcome of patients. The knockdown of IFI30 could inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells and significantly inhibit tumor growth <i>in vivo</i>. Increased accumulation of LC3-II and p62 suggested impaired autophagy in IFI30 knockdown cells. <b>Discussion:</b> As a result, we suggested that IFI30 might play a key role in the initiation and progression of human breast cancer and might be a new therapeutic target in breast cancer.",
  "The aim of this study was to explore the value of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with early-stage ER/PR-positive mucinous carcinoma.We identified early-stage ER/PR-positive mucinous carcinoma patients in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. We used propensity-score matching (PSM) analysis to eliminate selection bias and differences in baseline characteristics. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify significant prognostic factors. The primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS), which were evaluated with the Kaplan-Meier method.After propensity score matching, 805 pairs were selected. Patients with early-stage ER/PR-positive mucinous adenocarcinoma in the chemotherapy group had a better OS, but not BCSS, than those in the nonchemotherapy group after PSM (OS: p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; BCSS: p\u00a0=\u00a00.285). After stratifying by tumor size and lymph node status, adjuvant chemotherapy could significantly improve the OS of early-stage ER/PR-positive patients with tumors larger than 3\u00a0cm (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004) if they had negative lymph nodes (LNs). For patients positive LNs, the OS was significantly different between the chemotherapy group and the non-chemotherapy group when the tumors were larger than 1\u00a0cm\u00a0(T\u00a0=\u00a01-2.9\u00a0cm, p\u00a0=\u00a00.006; T\uff1e3\u00a0cm, p\u00a0=\u00a00.049, respectively).Adjuvant chemotherapy maybe improves prognosis in patients with negative LNs and tumors larger than 3\u00a0cm, or patients with LNs metastasis and tumors larger than 1\u00a0cm. We suggest considering clinical characteristics meanwhile when deciding chemotherapy or not. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) are expected to confirm our results in the future.",
  "Diagnosis of early invasive breast cancer relies on radiology and clinical evaluation, supplemented by biopsy confirmation. At least three issues burden this approach: a) suboptimal sensitivity and suboptimal positive predictive power of radiology screening and diagnostic approaches, respectively; b) invasiveness of biopsy with discomfort for women undergoing diagnostic tests; c) long turnaround time for recall tests. In the screening setting, radiology sensitivity is suboptimal, and when a suspicious lesion is detected and a biopsy is recommended, the positive predictive value of radiology is modest. Recent technological advances in medical imaging, especially in the field of artificial intelligence applied to image analysis, hold promise in addressing clinical challenges in cancer detection, assessment of treatment response, and monitoring disease progression. Radiomics include feature extraction from clinical images; these features are related to tumor size, shape, intensity, and texture, collectively providing comprehensive tumor characterization, the so-called radiomics signature of the tumor. Radiomics is based on the hypothesis that extracted quantitative data derives from mechanisms occurring at genetic and molecular levels. In this article we focus on the role and potential of radiomics in breast cancer diagnosis and prognostication.",
  "Long non coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are RNA molecules longer than 200 nucleotides that are not translated into proteins, but regulate the transcription of genes involved in different cellular processes, including cancer. Epidemiological analyses have demonstrated that parous women have a decreased risk of developing breast cancer in postmenopausal years if they went through a full term pregnancy in their early twenties. We here provide evidence of the role of BC200 in breast cancer and, potentially, in pregnancy's preventive effect in reducing the lifetime risk of developing breast cancer.Transcriptome analysis of normal breast of parous and nulliparous postmenopausal women revealed that several lncRNAs are differentially expressed in the parous breast. RNA sequencing of healthy postmenopausal breast tissue biopsies from eight parous and eight nulliparous women showed that there are 42 novel lncRNAs differentially expressed between these two groups. Screening of several of these 42 lncRNAs by RT-qPCR in different breast cancer cell lines, provided evidence that one in particular, lncEPCAM (more commonly known as BC200), was a strong candidate involved in cancer progression. Proliferation, migration, invasion and xerograph studies confirmed this hypothesis.The poorly studied oncogenic BC200 was selected to be tested in vitro and in vivo to determine its relevance in breast cancer and also to provide us with an understanding of its role in the increased susceptibility of the nulliparous women to cancer. Our results show that BC200 is upregulated in nulliparous women, and breast cancer cells and tissue. The role of BC200 is not completely understood in any of the breast cancer subtypes. We here provide evidence that BC200 has a role in luminal breast cancer as well as in the triple negative breast cancer subtype.When overexpressed in luminal and triple negative breast cancer cell lines, BC200 shows increased proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro. In vivo, overexpression of BC200 increased tumor size. Although treatment for cancer using lncRNAs as targets is in its infancy, the advancement in knowledge and technology to study their relevance in disease could lead to the development of novel treatment and preventive strategies for breast cancer.",
  "A prolonged time from first presentation to cancer diagnosis has been associated with worse disease-related outcomes. This study evaluated potential determinants of a long diagnostic interval among symptomatic breast cancer patients.This was a population-based, cross-sectional study of symptomatic breast cancer patients diagnosed in Ontario, Canada from 2007 to 2015 using administrative health data. The diagnostic interval was defined as the time from the earliest breast cancer-related healthcare encounter before diagnosis to the diagnosis date. Potential determinants of the diagnostic interval included patient, disease and usual healthcare utilization characteristics. We used multivariable quantile regression to evaluate their relationship with the diagnostic interval. We also examined differences in diagnostic interval by the frequency of encounters within the interval.Among 45,967 symptomatic breast cancer patients, the median diagnostic interval was 41\u00a0days (interquartile range 20-92). Longer diagnostic intervals were observed in younger patients, patients with higher burden of comorbid disease, recent immigrants to Canada, and patients with higher healthcare utilization prior to their diagnostic interval. Shorter intervals were observed in patients residing in long-term care facilities, patients with late stage disease, and patients who initially presented in an emergency department. Longer diagnostic intervals were characterized by an increased number of physician visits and breast procedures.The identification of groups at risk of longer diagnostic intervals provides direction for future research aimed at better understanding and improving breast cancer diagnostic pathways. Ensuring that all women receive a timely breast cancer diagnosis could improve breast cancer outcomes.",
  "The use of multi-gene panels for germline testing in breast cancer enables the estimation of cancer risk and guides risk-reducing management options. The aim of this study was to present data that demonstrate the different levels of actionability for multi-gene panels used in genetic testing of breast cancer patients and their family members.We performed an analysis in our clinical database to identify breast cancer patients undergoing genetic testing. We reviewed positive results in respect of risk estimation and management, cascade family testing, secondary findings and information for treatment decision-making.A total of 415 positive test reports were identified with 57.1%, 18.1%, 10.8% and 13.5% of individuals having pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in high, moderate, low and with insufficient evidence for breast cancer risk genes, respectively. Six point seven percent of individuals were double heterozygotes.Germline findings in 92% of individuals are linked to evidence-based treatment information and risk estimates for predisposition to breast and/or other cancer types. The use of germline findings for treatment decision making expands the indication of genetic testing to include individuals that could benefit from targeted treatments.",
  "Polygenic risk scores (PRS) could potentially improve breast cancer screening recommendations. Before a PRS can be considered for implementation, it needs rigorous evaluation, using performance measures that can inform about its future clinical value.To evaluate the prognostic performance of a regression model with a previously developed, prevalence-based PRS and age as predictors for breast cancer incidence in women from the Estonian biobank (EstBB) cohort; to compare it to the performance of a model including age only.We analyzed data on 30,312 women from the EstBB cohort. They entered the cohort between 2002 and 2011, were between 20 and 89\u2009years, without a history of breast cancer, and with full 5-year follow-up by 2015. We examined PRS and other potential risk factors as possible predictors in Cox regression models for breast cancer incidence. With 10-fold cross-validation we estimated 3- and 5-year breast cancer incidence predicted by age alone and by PRS plus age, fitting models on 90% of the data. Calibration, discrimination, and reclassification were calculated on the left-out folds to express prognostic performance.A total of 101 (3.33\u2030) and 185 (6.1\u2030) incident breast cancers were observed within 3 and 5\u2009years, respectively. For women in a defined screening age of 50-62\u2009years, the ratio of observed vs PRS-age modelled 3-year incidence was 0.86 for women in the 75-85% PRS-group, 1.34 for the 85-95% PRS-group, and 1.41 for the top 5% PRS-group. For 5-year incidence, this was respectively 0.94, 1.15, and 1.08. Yet the number of breast cancer events was relatively low in each PRS-subgroup. For all women, the model's AUC was 0.720 (95% CI: 0.675-0.765) for 3-year and 0.704 (95% CI: 0.670-0.737) for 5-year follow-up, respectively, just 0.022 and 0.023 higher than for the model with age alone. Using a 1% risk prediction threshold, the 3-year NRI for the PRS-age model was 0.09, and 0.05 for 5\u2009years.The model including PRS had modest incremental performance over one based on age only. A larger, independent study is needed to assess whether and how the PRS can meaningfully contribute to age, for developing more efficient screening strategies.",
  "To determine screening outcomes in women who have no recorded risk factors for breast cancer.A retrospective population-based cohort study included all 1,026,137 mammography screening episodes in 323,082 women attending the BreastScreen Western Australia (part of national biennial screening) program between July 2007 and June 2017. Cancer detection rates (CDR) and interval cancer rates (ICR) were calculated in screening episodes with no recorded risk factors for breast cancer versus at least one risk factor stratified by age. CDR was further stratified by timeliness of screening (<27 versus \u226527 months); ICR was stratified by breast density.Amongst 566,948 screens (55.3%) that had no recorded risk factors, 2347 (40.9%) screen-detected cancers were observed. In screens with no risk factors, CDR was 50 (95%CI 48-52) per 10,000 screens and ICR was 7.9 (95%CI 7.4-8.4) per 10,000 women-years, estimates that were lower than screens with at least one risk factor (CDR 83 (95%CI 80-86) per 10,000 screens, ICR 12.2 (95%CI 11.5-13.0) per 10,000 women-years). Compared to timely screens with risk factors, delayed screens with no risk factors had similar CDR across all age groups and a higher proportion of node positive cancers (26.1% vs 20.7%). ICR was lowest in screens that had no risk factors nor dense breasts in all age groups.Majority of screens had no recorded breast cancer risk factors, hence a substantial proportion of screen-detected cancers occur in these screening episodes. Our findings may not justify less frequent screening in women with no risk factors.",
  "Data on the link between total and individual dairy product consumption and risk of breast cancer are controversial, especially in Middle Eastern populations.This study aimed to evaluate the association between total and individual dairy product consumption and odds of breast cancer among Iranian women.In the context of a population-based case-control study on 350 patients with pathologically confirmed cases of breast cancer and 700 age-matched controls, we assessed dietary intakes using a 106-item semi-quantitative dish-based food frequency questionnaire. Consumption of low- and high-fat dairy products as well as dietary intakes of pasteurized milk, cheese and yogurt were computed.Mean (\u00b1\u2009SD) age and BMI of study participants was 62.4\u2009\u00b1\u200910.8 y and 24.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.2\u00a0kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. After controlling for potential covariates, individuals in the top quartile of low-fat dairy product intake were less likely to have breast cancer than those in the bottom quartile (OR 0.08; 95% CI 0.05-0.16), while those with the highest intake of high-fat dairy intake had greater odds for breast cancer than those with the lowest intake (OR 8.62; 95% CI 4.78-15.55). Despite lack of a significant association between yogurt and cheese consumption and odds of breast cancer, we found a positive association between total milk intake (OR 1.76; 95% CI 1.16-2.65) and breast cancer, after controlling for potential confounders.Low-fat dairy intake was inversely and high-fat dairy consumption was positively associated with breast cancer. No significant association was found between yogurt and cheese consumption and breast cancer, while total milk intake was associated with a greater odds of breast cancer.",
  "When considering BRCA1/2 genetic testing for diagnosis of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC), family history (FH) of breast and ovarian cancer is commonly considered. However, FH of other HBOC-related cancers, such as prostate, pancreatic, and skin cancer (malignant melanoma), is often overlooked.Among 945 patients who received genetic testing of BRCA1/2 at our hospital between October 2010 and September 2021, we compared the FH of 123 patients diagnosed with HBOC and 669 other patients who had breast cancer and had a documented FH. This study focused on the FH of HBOC-related cancers such as breast, ovarian, prostate, pancreatic, and skin cancer, as well as colorectal, gastric, liver, lung, and uterine cancers, which are common among Japanese, and other cancers.FH of prostate, pancreatic, and skin cancer was significantly higher in the BRCA2 pathogenic variant (PV) cases than in the wild-type (WT) cases. The mean number of family members are as follows: BRCA1 PV/ BRCA2 PV/ WT; prostate cancer: 0.05/ 0.34/ 0.09 (P\u2009<\u20090.0001, Kruskal-Wallis multiple comparisons test), pancreatic cancer: 0.13/ 0.21/ 0.10 (P\u2009=\u20090.01637), and skin cancer: 0.03/ 0.07/ 0.01 (P\u2009=\u20090.00129), respectively.When considering BRCA1/2 genetic testing, FH of prostate, pancreatic, and skin cancers may also be examined as HBOC-related cancers to provide testing for patients who would benefit from it. However, further studies for the association between skin cancer and HBOC will be required because it has not been reported in Japan.",
  "Breast cancer risk associated with germline likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants (PV) varies by gene, often by penetrance (high >50% or moderate 20-50%), and specific locus. Germline PVs in BRCA1 and BRCA2 play important roles in the development of breast and ovarian cancer in particular, as well as in other cancers such as pancreatic and prostate cancers and melanoma. Recent studies suggest that other cancer susceptibility genes, including ATM, CHEK2, PALB2, RAD51C and RAD51D confer differential risks of breast and other specific cancers. In the era of multigene panel testing, advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have notably reduced costs in the United States (US) and enabled sequencing of BRCA1/2 concomitantly with additional genes. The use of multigene-panel testing is beginning to expand in Europe as well. Further research into the clinical implications of variants in moderate penetrance genes, particularly in unaffected carriers, is needed for appropriate counselling and risk management with data-driven plans for surveillance and/or risk reduction. For individuals at high risk without any pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in cancer susceptibility genes or some carriers of pathogenic variants in moderate-risk genes such as ATM and CHEK2, polygenic risk scores offer promise to help stratify breast cancer risk and guide appropriate risk management options. Cancer patients whose tumours are driven by the loss of function of both copies of a predisposition gene may benefit from therapies targeting the biological alterations induced by the dysfunctional gene e.g. poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and other novel pathway agents in cancers with DNA repair deficiencies. A better understanding of mechanisms by which germline variants drive various malignancies may lead to improvements in both therapeutic and preventive management options.",
  "Estrogen receptor (ER+) breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed breast cancer subtype. Currently, adjuvant treatment for early stage disease consists of endocrine therapy, with or without chemotherapy and bone-targeted therapy, delivered in a risk-adapted manner. Despite this multimodal approach, a significant proportion of high risk patients will develop incurable distant recurrences. There is an ongoing need to develop new treatment strategies that address the biologic causes of treatment failure and to identify the individual patients who can benefit from such interventions. Here we review the clinical investigation of targeted and novel therapies, including inhibitors of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, oral selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs), and PARP-inhibitors for the treatment of early ER+\u00a0breast cancer. Furthermore, we highlight opportunities in biomarker development to help guide the delivery of escalated adjuvant strategies.",
  "Recent genome-wide association studies have shown that many single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with breast cancer risk. However, it is often unclear how these SNPs are related to breast cancer. Analysis of associations between SNPs and phenotypes may be important for determining mechanisms of action, including carcinogenesis.In previous case-control studies, we found three SNPs (rs2046210, rs3757318, and rs3573318) associated with breast cancer risk in Japanese women. Among these SNPs, two (rs2046210 and rs3757318) are located at 6q25.1, in proximity to the estrogen receptor 1 gene (ESR1). Using data from these studies, we examined associations between factors related to breast cancer risk, such as height, weight, and breast density, and the three SNPs in cases and controls. We also investigated whether the SNPs correlated with breast cancer features, such as estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor type-2 (HER2) status, and clinical stage.There was a significant difference in mean height between risk and non-risk allele carriers for rs2046210 (156.0\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8 vs. 154.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.5\u00a0cm, p\u2009=\u20090.002), and rs3757318 (155.8\u2009\u00b1\u20095.7 vs. 154.7\u2009\u00b1\u20095.6\u00a0cm, p\u2009=\u20090.035) in cases, but no significant associations between height and these SNPs in controls. There was also a significant difference in breast density between risk and non-risk allele carriers for rs2046210 (p\u2009=\u20090.040) and rs3757318 (p\u2009=\u20090.044) in cases. rs2046210 and rs3757318 risk allele carriers tended to have higher breast density in all subjects and in controls. In cases, rs3757318 risk allele carriers were also significantly more likely to be ER-negative compared to non-risk allele carriers (ER-positive rate: 77% vs. 84%, p\u2009=\u20090.036).SNPs rs2046210 and rs3757318, which are associated with breast cancer risk in Japanese women, were significantly associated with height and high breast density, and this association was particularly strong in those with breast cancer. These findings suggest that SNPs in the ESR1 gene region affect phenotypes such as height and breast density.",
  "Breast cancer is one of the most frequently occurring cancers during pregnancy and its incidence is increasing. Many studies have shown poor outcomes, the causes of which remain unclear.To analyze radiologic characteristics, histology, and prognosis factors of breast cancer during pregnancy.A total of 42 patients with breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy (BCP) were matched with 84 patients with breast cancer of similar age who were not pregnant. Sensitivity of radiology, tumor characteristics, prognosis factors, disease-free survival, and overall survival were analyzed.The sensitivity of breast ultrasound was higher than that of mammography for both groups. Ultrasound sensitivity for cancer was 95.7% in patients with BCP versus 98% in the not pregnant group, with non-statistically significant differences. Mammography sensitivity for cancer was 56.5% in patients with BCP versus 61% in the not pregnant group, with non-statistically significant differences. The stage at diagnosis according to the TNM staging system was significantly higher in patients with BCP with stage IV cancer: 16.7% in patients with BCP versus 3.7% in the not pregnant group (<i>p</i> = 0.03). No statistically significant differences were observed in histologic grade, Ki-67 index, or molecular subtype. Disease-free survival and overall survival were significantly lower in patients with BCP (<i>p</i> = 0.002 and <i>p</i> = 0.04). Multivariate analysis showed no difference when adjusting for stage and surrogate molecular subtype.Breast ultrasound shows a high sensitivity to detect breast cancer during pregnancy. BCP is diagnosed at a higher stage than in nonpregnant women. In our series, patients with BCP had poorer outcomes than the not pregnant group. These results were not observed when adjusting for stage.",
  "TP53 status based on TP53 signature, a gene expression profile to determine the presence or absence of TP53 mutation, is an independent prognostic factor of breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to develop a simple diagnostic system for TP53 signature status.We developed a multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction system to determine TP53 status. Based on this system, prospectively collected 189 patients with stage I and II breast cancer were determined to have TP53 mutant signature or TP53 wild-type signature. The prognostic significance of the TP53 signature by the diagnostic system was analyzed.The diagnostic accuracy of TP53 status and reproducibility of this diagnosis system was confirmed. Using the diagnostic system, 89 patients were classified as TP53 mutant signature and the remaining 100 cases were classified as TP53 wild-type signature. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) among patients with TP53 mutant signature was significantly shorter than that among those with TP53 wild-type signature. On univariate and multivariate analyses, the TP53 signature status was an independent predictor of RFS. RFS among patients with TP53 mutant signature was significantly shorter than that among those with TP53 wild-type signature in a cohort of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Although a difference was not significant, no recurrent cases was observed in TP53 wild-type signature group in triple negative breast cancer.This simple and precise diagnostic system to determine TP53 signature status may help in prognostic assessment, therapeutic decision-making, and treatment optimization in patients with breast cancer.",
  "In response to the Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Japanese government declared a state of emergency in Saitama, Chiba, Tokyo, Kanagawa, Osaka, Hyogo and Fukuoka prefectures on April 7, 2020; this was extended to the remaining prefectures on April 16, 2020. The state of emergency was lifted on May 25, 2020. Although it was known that breast cancer screening was postponed or canceled during this period, the actual extent of postponement or cancellation has not been clarified.We investigated postponement or cancellation of breast cancer screening between April and May 2020 using a cross-sectional, web-based, self-reported questionnaire survey. In addition, we examined the association between socioeconomic and health-related factors and postponement or cancellation by multivariable log-binominal regression.Among 1874 women aged 30-79\u00a0years who had scheduled breast cancer screening during the study period, 493 women (26.3%) postponed or canceled screening. While women aged 30-39\u00a0years and 70-79\u00a0years postponed or canceled less frequently than women aged 40-49\u00a0years (prevalence ratio\u2009=\u20090.62 and 0.56, respectively), there was no significant difference between age groups in the women aged 40-69\u00a0years. Postponement or cancellation was more frequent in five prefectures, where the state of emergency was declared early (prevalence ratio\u2009=\u20091.25). Employment status, annual household income, family structure, academic background, smoking status, and fear of COVID-19 were not associated with postponement or cancellation.Although care should be taken with the interpretation of these findings due to possible biases, they suggest that the postponement or cancellation of breast cancer screening might be due more to facility suspension than to individual factors. It is necessary to explore the ideal way of encouraging breast cancer screening uptake, in an environment of coexistence with COVID-19.",
  "The cancer stage at diagnosis, treatment delays, and breast cancer mortality vary with insurance status.Using the Missouri Cancer Registry, this analysis included 31,485 women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2015. Odds ratios (ORs) of a late-stage (stage III or IV) diagnosis and a treatment delay (>60 days after the diagnosis) were calculated with logistic regression. The hazard ratio (HR) of breast cancer mortality was calculated with Cox proportional hazards regression. Mediation analysis was used to quantify the individual contributions of each covariate to mortality.The OR of a late-stage diagnosis was higher for patients with Medicaid (OR, 1.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.56-1.91) or no insurance (OR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.91-2.78) in comparison with privately insured patients. Medicare (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.10-1.37), Medicaid (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.37-1.85), and uninsured patients (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.18-2.12) had higher odds of a treatment delay. The HR of breast cancer-specific mortality was significantly increased in the groups with public insurance or no insurance and decreased after sequential adjustments for sociodemographic factors (HR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.96-2.91), tumor characteristics (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.05-1.56), and treatment (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.01-1.50). Late-stage diagnoses accounted for 72.5% of breast cancer mortality in the uninsured.Compared with the privately insured, women with public or no insurance had a higher risk for advanced breast cancer, a >60-day treatment delay, and death from breast cancer. Particularly for the uninsured, Medicaid expansion and increased funding for education and screening programs could decrease breast cancer disparities.",
  "Background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) on breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be associated with breast cancer risk, but previous studies of the association are equivocal and limited by incomplete blinding of BPE assessment. In this study, we evaluated the association between BPE and breast cancer based on fully blinded assessments of BPE in the unaffected breast.The Imaging and Epidemiology (IMAGINE) study is a multicenter breast cancer case-control study of women receiving diagnostic, screening, or follow-up breast MRI, recruited from three comprehensive cancer centers in the USA. Cases had a first diagnosis of unilateral breast cancer and controls had no history of or current breast cancer. A single board-certified breast radiologist with 12\u2009years' experience, blinded to case-control status and clinical information, assessed the unaffected breast for BPE without view of the affected breast of cases (or the corresponding breast laterality of controls). The association between BPE and breast cancer was estimated by multivariable logistic regression separately for premenopausal and postmenopausal women.The analytic dataset included 835 cases and 963 controls. Adjusting for fibroglandular tissue (breast density), age, race/ethnicity, BMI, parity, family history of breast cancer, BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations, and other confounders, moderate/marked BPE (vs minimal/mild BPE) was associated with breast cancer among premenopausal women [odds ratio (OR) 1.49, 95% CI 1.05-2.11; p\u2009=\u20090.02]. Among postmenopausal women, mild/moderate/marked vs minimal BPE had a similar, but statistically non-significant, association with breast cancer (OR 1.45, 95% CI 0.92-2.27; p\u2009=\u20090.1).BPE is associated with breast cancer in premenopausal women, and possibly postmenopausal women, after adjustment for breast density and confounders. Our results suggest that BPE should be evaluated alongside breast density for inclusion in models predicting breast cancer risk.",
  "Treatment of early breast cancer in older women is usually not guideline concordant owing to lack of routine evaluation of their potential frailty. We assessed the feasibility and impact of a self-administered geriatric assessment on the decision-making process in women aged 65 and above treated in a UK District General Hospital.One hundred and one patients, aged 65 and above, with early stage, non-metastatic breast cancer were prospectively recruited between Dec-2018 and March-2021. Patients with metastatic breast cancer, a previous history of cancer and dementia were excluded. All patients had a geriatric assessment with a self-administered questionnaire (mycarg.org). All cases were discussed in the multidisciplinary meeting (MDT) and a pre geriatric assessment recommendations was made, based on the tumour grade, size, node status and receptor status. The findings of the assessment were later discussed in a second meeting and a further recommendation was made based on the geriatric assessment. Any change in the proposed treatment was recorded. Potential factors (age, Body Mass Index, co-morbidities, medications, instrumental activities of daily living, and basic activities of daily living, social support and psychological status) associated with a change in the treatment recommendation were compared using Pearson's Chi square tests for categorized data, and Mann Whitney U test for continuous data. A multivariate logistic regression was performed to test the association between geriatric assessment domains and change in treatment decision. The multivariate model was built using variables which were associated in the bivariate analysis with a p-value<\u20090.20.Patients aged less than 70 years were more likely to be diagnosed through screening programme as compared to older women (64.4% vs. 35.6%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Self-administered geriatric assessment identified patients who were requiring assistance in their daily routine activities, and hence, were assessed to have higher morbidity status. A third of patients required assistance in their routine activities, with 18/101 patients requiring significant help during self-care. 90% patients were independent for Activity of Daily Living (ADL) at baseline and 34.76% for Instrumental Activity of Daily Living (IADL). Among the 101 patients evaluated, proposed change in the initial cancer treatment plan was made in 21.8% of patients after the second MDT. Omission of chemotherapy was recommended in 4 patients, omission of radiotherapy in 15 patients and omission of both chemo and radiotherapy in 2 patients. One patient was advised to omit Zolidronic acid, as she was noted to have renal impairment. No patient in this cohort had suggestion for omission of surgery or endocrine therapy. In the bivariate analysis, need for assistance for activities of daily living (ADLs), low physical performance (KPS), polypharmacy (3 or more medications), lack of social support as assessed using the Social Support: Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Social Support Survey and high BMI (30 or more) all showed significance but on multivariate analysis only polypharmacy was significantly associated with change in the initial cancer treatment plan.The results of this study of breast cancer patients aged 65 and above suggest that a self-administered geriatric assessment may influence treatment recommendations in a subset of patients. Recommendations that were influenced by the geriatric assessment mainly included those related to the significant morbidity that may have impacted the use of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.",
  "Three recently published prospective trials on regional nodal irradiation (RNI) in early breast cancer showed a reduction on breast cancer mortality, any first breast recurrence and/or distant recurrence rate. The positive outcomes of the modern trials reflect the development in radiotherapy by being more precise nowadays in radiation dose delivery to the lymph nodes, while reducing the radiation dose to heart and lungs. The possibility of axillary radiotherapy (ART) to replace axillary node dissection (ALND) after positive sentinel node (SLNB) biopsy is explored in a few trials. In the AMAROS trial both ALND and ART provide excellent and comparable LRR in SN+ patients. While the lymphedema was 2 times higher after ALND compared to ART. The ACOSOG Z0011 10 years results did not show a significant difference in locoregional recurrence rate or survival. These equal results were seen despite that in 27.4% of the patients had additional positive nodes removed beyond SLN in the patients who received axillary dissection (ALND). The IBCSG 23-01 phase III trial showed that there is no need for extra treatment of the axilla after micro-metastases in SLNB, however in this trial nearly all patients received breast irradiation including part of the axilla, often combined with adjuvant therapy. The introduction of neo- adjuvant systemic treatment (NACT) may lead to less RNI in early breast cancer, especially as NACT leads to pCR in axillary lymph nodes in about one third of the patient.",
  "RNA N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) modification is primarily regulated by m<sup>6</sup>A regulators, which play significant epigenetic regulatory roles in tumorigenesis, tumor development, and tumor immune microenvironment. However, the correlation between m<sup>6</sup>A regulators and immune cell infiltration in breast cancer remains unclear.In this study, m<sup>6</sup>A modification patterns were evaluated based on 31 m<sup>6</sup>A modification regulators. m<sup>6</sup>A clusters were determined by consensus clustering. Immune landscape and immune cell infiltration subgroups were characterized by m<sup>6</sup>A clusters. Key module and hub genes related to m<sup>6</sup>A regulators and immune infiltration cells were identified by WGCNA. LASSO algorithm was applied to select prognostic signatures. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was applied to assess the prognostic value of gene signatures.Two distinct m<sup>6</sup>A clusters were determined based on the expression of 31 m<sup>6</sup>A modification regulators and characterized by two tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) immune cell infiltration subgroups. Further, a total of 1971 differentially expressed genes between breast cancer patients and healthy controls were screened, nine modules associated with clinical characteristics of breast cancer patients were identified. Later, one key module and 13 hub genes correlated with m<sup>6</sup>A regulators and immune infiltration cells were identified. LASSO Cox regression analysis selected and constructed a ten-gene prognostic model to build a risk score system for individual breast cancer patient prognosis. The performance of the ten-gene-based risk score system was further validated in an independent dataset with an AUC of 0.659.This study revealed that m<sup>6</sup>A modification regulators played a significant role in the TIME regulation of breast cancer. The hub ten gene-based risk score system is valuable in predicting the prognosis of breast cancer patients, which may provide potential significance for breast cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and immunotherapy in the future.",
  "The aberrant expression of stromal gene signatures in breast cancer has been widely studied. However, the association of stromal gene signatures with tumor immunity, progression, and clinical outcomes remains lacking.Based on eight breast tumor stroma (BTS) transcriptomics datasets, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between BTS and normal breast stroma. Based on the DEGs, we identified dysregulated pathways and prognostic hub genes, hub oncogenes, hub protein kinases, and other key marker genes associated with breast cancer. Moreover, we compared the enrichment levels of stromal and immune signatures between breast cancer patients with bad and good clinical outcomes. We also investigated the association between tumor stroma-related genes and breast cancer progression.The DEGs included 782 upregulated and 276 downregulated genes in BTS versus normal breast stroma. The pathways significantly associated with the DEGs included cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, chemokine signaling, T cell receptor signaling, cell adhesion molecules, focal adhesion, and extracellular matrix-receptor interaction. Protein-protein interaction network analysis identified the stromal hub genes with prognostic value in breast cancer, including two oncogenes (COL1A1 and IL21R), two protein kinases encoding genes (PRKACA and CSK), and a growth factor encoding gene (PLAU). Moreover, we observed that the patients with bad clinical outcomes were less enriched in stromal and antitumor immune signatures (CD8\u2009+\u2009T cells and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes) but more enriched in tumor cells and immunosuppressive signatures (MDSCs and CD4\u2009+\u2009regulatory T cells) compared with the patients with good clinical outcomes. The ratios of CD8\u2009+\u2009/CD4\u2009+\u2009regulatory T cells were lower in the patients with bad clinical outcomes. Furthermore, we identified the tumor stroma-related genes, including MCM4, SPECC1, IMPA2, and AGO2, which were gradually upregulated through grade I, II, and III breast cancers. In contrast, COL14A1, ESR1, SLIT2, IGF1, CH25H, PRR5L, ABCA6, CEP126, IGDCC4, LHFP, MFAP3, PCSK5, RAB37, RBMS3, SETBP1, and TSPAN11 were gradually downregulated through grade I, II, and III breast cancers. It suggests that the expression of these stromal genes has an association with the progression of breast cancers. These progression-associated genes also displayed an expression association with recurrence-free survival in breast cancer patients.This study identified tumor stroma-associated biomarkers correlated with deregulated pathways, tumor immunity, tumor progression, and clinical outcomes in breast cancer. Our findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of breast cancer.",
  "To investigate the effect of 21-gene recurrence score (RS) on chemotherapy-decision making and prognosis in breast cancer patients aged <40 years.Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, we included patients aged <40 years with tumor size \u22645\u00a0cm, node negative, and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer between 2004 and 2015. Correlations among the 21-gene RS, chemotherapy decision-making and prognosis were analyzed.We included 2721 patients in this study. According to TAILORx cutoffs, 352 (12.9%), 1814 (66.7%), and 555 (20.4%) patients were classified as low-, intermediate-, and high-risk cohorts, respectively. The 21-gene RS categories were associated with the probability of receiving chemotherapy, with 7.1%, 33.4%, and 77.1% of patients in low-, intermediate-, and high-risk cohorts treated with chemotherapy, respectively (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Those in the intermediate-risk cohort were significantly less likely to receive chemotherapy over time (P\u00a0=\u00a00.008), and the trends of chemotherapy receipt were stable in the low-risk and high-risk cohorts over time. Multivariate analysis showed that the 21-gene RS was an independent prognostic indicator for breast cancer specific survival. In the stratified analysis, the receipt of chemotherapy was associated with better breast cancer specific survival in the high-risk cohort (P\u00a0=\u00a00.028), but not in the intermediate-risk cohort (P\u00a0=\u00a00.223).21-gene RS has clinical implications for young breast cancer patients with respect to optimizing chemotherapy-decisions. Despite increasing rates of chemotherapy receipt in young patients, more studies are needed to determine the definitive effect of chemotherapy in young patients with three RS categories.",
  "An increasing number of women is surviving breast cancer and due to that at risk of developing an isolated ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) or a contralateral breast cancer (CBC). Patients' main concern is cancer recurrence. Patient counseling on breast cancer recurrence is challenging. In order to provide healthcare professionals and patients more guidance, a systematic literature review of the incidence of isolated IBTR and CBC in women diagnosed with early invasive breast cancer was performed. Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library were searched from 2000 until October 2015. Multicenter studies reporting an IBTR or CBC rate in curatively treated adult females diagnosed with invasive breast cancer were included. The initial search yielded 6998 potentially relevant articles. Twenty were eligible for inclusion, representing 25 recurrence incidence rates. Both isolated IBTR and CBC incidence rates steadily increased with the length of follow-up, indicating that IBTR and CBC occur even more than 15 years after diagnosis. The annual incidence rate of isolated IBTR and CBC in women diagnosed with an early invasive breast cancer was 0.6% (range: 0.4-1.1%) and 0.5% (range: 0.2-0.7%), respectively. Analyzed data were lacking information about important risk factors and given treatment with regard to the incidence of recurrence, which hampers the prediction of patient tailored recurrence risks. The presented rates are therefore the best available estimates of isolated IBTR and CBC annual incidence rates based on the current literature. Healthcare professionals could use these rates in their communication with patients diagnosed with early invasive breast cancer.",
  "Patients with metastatic breast cancer are at high risk for developing vertebral compression fractures due to underlying bone metastases and bone density loss. Vertebral augmentation techniques including percutaneous vertebroplasty and percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty are techniques used to stabilize compression fractures and improve pain. However, rare complications from these interventions have been observed, including spinal cord compression, nerve root compression, venous cement embolism, and pulmonary cement embolism. These complications pose unique potential challenges for patients with cancer who may already have decreased lung function and potential for venous thromboembolism. In this review, we first describe the role of percutaneous vertebral augmentations in patients with metastatic cancer, with a particular focus on patients with breast cancer. Then, we describe complications of vertebral augmentation in two patients with metastatic breast cancer including long-term symptomatic and radiographic follow-up.",
  "Mucinous carcinoma (MC) is a rare breast cancer characterized by the presence of large extracellular mucin amount. Two main subtypes can be distinguished: pure (PMC) and mixed (MMC). We conducted a retrospective MC analysis in our prospective maintained database, calculating disease-free survival (DFS) and 5-year overall survival (OS). We found a global 92.1% OS (higher in MMC group and statistically significative) and a DFS of 95.3% (higher in MMC group but not statistically significative).",
  "<b>Background:</b> Genetic variations of mu-opioid receptors are well known to contribute to growth and progression of tumors. The most common single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the mu-opioid receptor 1 gene (OPRM1) is the A118G mutation. We examined the association between the recurrent breast cancer and genotypes of <i>OPRM1</i> A118G SNP (AA vs. AG vs. GG) in Korean women population. <b>Methods:</b> We analysed medical records and genetic data of 200 patients aged more than 20 who underwent primary breast cancer surgery from June 2012 to June 2014 and diagnosed recurrent breast cancer from June 2012 to September 2019. <b>Results:</b> The incidence of recurrent breast cancer was 6.1%, 8.2%, and 4.8% in genotype AA, AG and GG, respectively (<i>p</i>=0.780). The incidence of recurrent breast cancer in volatile anaesthesia group was 7.0% and 7.1% in total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) group (RR = 0.984, 95% CI = 0.328 - 2.951; <i>p</i> = 0.978). <b>Conclusion</b>: <i>OPRM1</i> A118G SNP had no influence on breast cancer recurrence in Korean women. Anaesthesia technique did not show significant effect on the incidence of recurrent breast cancer.",
  "FOXA1 is a pioneer transcription factor which has been established as a carcinogenic factor and can regulate the expression of downstream target genes in breast cancer. We hypothesized that genetic variants modulating FOXA1 expression might play a role in the risk of breast cancer.Physical interaction predicted by PreSTIGE analysis and CHIA-PET data integration with cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) based SNP-FOXA1 analysis were used to identify potentially regulatory variants modulating the expression of FOXA1. Then, we utilized a case-control study consisting of 855 new diagnosed breast cancer cases and 920 controls in the Chinese population to identify breast cancer associated variants. Biological assays were conducted in breast cancer cell lines to illustrate the effects of associated variants on breast cancer risk.We identified that rs7160774 G\u2009>\u2009A variant was associated with lower risk of breast cancer (OR\u2009=\u20090.77, 95% confidence interval\u2009=\u20090.62-0.96, P\u2009=\u20090.022). Biological experiments indicated that rs7160774[A] allele down-regulated the expression of FOXA1 compared to the G allele by influencing transcription factor binding affinity, thus playing an important role in the development of breast cancer.Our study suggested that the regulatory variant rs7160774 was associated with risk of breast cancer by long-range modulating FOXA1 expression and provided critical insights into pinpoint causal genetic variants.",
  "Triple negative breast cancer encompasses several biological entities with different outcomes and is a priority to identify which patients require more treatment to reduce the risk of recurrence and which patients need less treatment.Among the 210 women with first primary invasive apocrine non metastatic breast cancer operated on between January 1998 and December 2016\u00a0at the European Institute Oncology, Milan, we identified 24 patients with a pT1-pT2, node-negative, triple negative subtype and Ki-67\u00a0\u2264\u00a020% who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy (CT). We compared the outcome of this cohort with a similar group of 24 patients with ductal tumors who received adjuvant chemotherapy, matched by pathological stage and biological features and also with a similar group of 12 patients with apocrine tumors who received adjuvant chemotherapy.The median age was 64 and 61 years in the apocrine (w/o CT) and ductal group, respectively. The median value of Ki-67 expression was 12% in the apocrine group (w/o CT) and 16% in the ductal group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). After a median follow-up of 7.5 years, no patients in the apocrine group (w/o CT) experienced a breast cancer related event compared with 4 events in the ductal carcinoma group (Gray test p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.11).The outcome of selected apocrine triple negative breast cancer patients who did not received adjuvant chemotherapy is excellent and supports a treatment de-escalation. Multicenter projects focusing on the possibility of avoiding adjuvant chemotherapy in selected subtypes of triple negative breast cancers with favorable outcome are warranted.",
  "In order to minimise the risk of breast cancer patients for COVID-19 infection related morbidity and mortality prioritisation of care has utmost importance since the onset of the pandemic. However, COVID-19 related risk in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery has not been studied yet. We evaluated the safety of breast cancer surgery during COVID-19 pandemic in the West of Scotland region.A prospective cohort study of patients having breast cancer surgery was carried out in a geographical region during the first eight weeks of the hospital lockdown and outcomes were compared to the regional cancer registry data of pre-COVID-19 patients of the same units (n\u00a0=\u00a01415).188 operations were carried out in 179 patients. Tumour size was significantly larger in patients undergoing surgery during hospital lockdown than before (cT3-4: 16.8% vs. 7.4%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; pT2 - pT4: 45.5% vs. 35.6%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). ER negative and HER-2 positive rate was significantly higher during lockdown (ER negative: 41.3% vs. 17%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; HER-2 positive: 23.4% vs. 14.8%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.004). While breast conservation rate was lower during lockdown (58.6% vs. 65%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), level II oncoplastic conservation was significantly higher in order to reduce mastectomy rate (22.8% vs. 5.6%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). No immediate reconstruction was offered during lockdown. 51.2% had co-morbidity, and 7.8% developed postoperative complications in lockdown. There was no peri-operative COVID-19 infection related morbidity or mortality.breast cancer can be safely provided during COVID-19 pandemic in selected patients.",
  "<i>YAP1</i> plays a key role as a transcriptional coactivator in the Hippo pathway. Based on conflicting reports regarding <i>YAP1</i> function in cancer, this study discerned its role in breast carcinogenesis. First, a systematic review of salient breast cancer studies targeting YAP1 dysregulation was performed. Additionally, freshly excised tumor specimens of approximately\u00a0200 breast cancer patients were processed for quantification of <i>YAP1</i> expression at mRNA and protein levels using quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. <i>YAP1</i> expression was nine\u00a0folds higher in tumors versus controls and significantly associated with metastasis (p <\u00a00.05) and poor survival in Pakistani breast cancer patients. These findings establish the role of <i>YAP1</i> overexpression in tumorigenesis and metastasis. Hence, <i>YAP1</i> inhibition may be considered a possible therapeutic strategy.",
  "The TNM system, which reflects the anatomical extent of disease, was used for stage definition. In the recently published AJCC 8th edition, the new staging system of the clinical and pathological prognostic stage, which incorporates biological factors, is introduced.A total of 2622 patients with primary breast cancer at stage I-III were included in this study. The anatomic stage (aStage) and the pathological prognostic stage (ppStage) for each case were determined according to the definition of the AJCC 8th edition, and the influence of these stages on the prognosis was compared.The stage distributions of aStage and ppStage were as follows: aStage, stage IA (54.8%), IB (1.1%), IIA (26.1%), IIB (9.2%), IIIA (5.6%), IIIB (0.1%), and IIIC (3.1%); and ppStage, stage IA (66.6%), IB (13.1%), IIA (11.1%), IIB (3.2%), IIIA (3.3%), IIIB (1.4%), and IIIC (1.2%). Compared with the aStage, the ppStage stayed the same in 1710 patients (65.2%), was downstaged in 778 patients (29.7%), and was upstaged in 134 patients. The pathological tumor size (pT2) and lymph node metastasis (pN1) were associated with downstaging, and histological grade 3 was associated with upstaging. ER positivity, PgR positivity, and HER2-positivity were significantly associated with downstaging, and the TN subtype was associated with upstaging. Both the aStage and ppStage were significantly associated with the prognosis; however, the Kaplan-Meier curves for the relapse-free survival (RFS), distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS), and overall survival were better stratified by the ppStage.The ppStage reflects the prognosis of patients with early breast cancer more accurately than the aStage.",
  "Several studies have recently reported that the relationships between serum vitamin D and the prognosis or the pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer. However, there are no data regarding the clinical impacts of the vitamin D in Japanese breast cancer patients so far.In the present study, a total of 250 patients with clinical Stage I-III primary breast cancer who were treated with NAC and subsequently underwent definitive surgery were included. Serum 25-hydroxvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels were evaluated using blood samples obtained before NAC.The serum 25(OH)D was positively associated with age, and the serum 25(OH)D was significantly higher in postmenopausal women than that in pre/peri-menopausal women. Serum 25(OH)D level was not associated with the achievement of pathological complete response (pCR) in this cohort. The low 25(OH)D levels were significantly associated with shorter time to distant recurrence (TTDR). According to the univariate analysis, high clinical stage before NAC (cStage III) and low serum 25(OH)D level were significantly associated with the shorter TTDR, and pCR was significantly associated with the longer TTDR. According to a multivariate analysis, low serum 25(OH)D level were independent poor prognostic factors for TTDR.The low 25(OH)D levels were significantly associated with poorer prognosis in Japanese women with operable breast cancer patients treated with NAC.",
  "Adiposity and weight change among patients with breast cancer are associated with mortality, but there is limited evidence on the associations with distant recurrence or other causes of death or on central adiposity. Moreover, the relationship with breast cancer subtypes and by menopause status is unclear.We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies of breast cancer patients investigating the associations of general and central adiposity (body mass index [BMI] and waist circumference [WC], respectively), before and after diagnosis, and weight change, with all-cause mortality, breast cancer-specific mortality (BCSM), and recurrence.173 studies (519,544 patients, 60,249 deaths overall, and 25,751 breast cancer deaths)\u00a0were included. For BMI\u2009\u00a0<\u20091\u00a0year post diagnosis, compared with normal weight women, the summary relative risk (RR) for obese women was 1.21 (1.15-1.27) for all-cause mortality, 1.22 (1.13-1.32) for BCSM, 1.12 (1.06-1.18) for recurrence, and 1.19 (1.11-1.28) for distant recurrence. Obesity was associated with all-cause mortality and BCSM in patients with ER+\u2009or HER2+\u2009tumors, whereas no clear association was observed in patients with triple-negative tumors. Similar associations were observed by menopausal status. Stronger associations were observed in East Asians than Europeans. Central adiposity was associated with all-cause mortality, while large weight gain was associated with all-cause mortality, BCSM, and recurrence.Higher adiposity is associated with all-cause mortality, BCSM, recurrence, and distant recurrence in breast cancer patients, with similar associations by menopausal status and some evidence of heterogeneity by subtypes. Weight gain is also associated with recurrence and survival among breast cancer patients.",
  "Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, divided into subtypes based on the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Subtypes have different biology and prognosis, with accumulating evidence of different risk factors. The purpose of this study was to compare breast cancer risk factors across tumor subtypes in a large, diverse mammography population.Women aged 40-84 without a history of breast cancer with a screening mammogram at three United States health systems from 2006 to 2015 were included. Risk factor questionnaires were completed at mammogram visit, supplemented by electronic health records. Invasive tumor subtype was defined by immunohistochemistry as ER/PR+HER2-, ER/PR+HER2+, ER, and PR-HER2+, or triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Cox proportional hazards models were run for each subtype. Associations of race, reproductive history, prior breast problems, family history, breast density, and body mass index (BMI) were assessed. The association of tumor subtypes with screen detection and interval cancer was assessed using logistic regression among invasive cases.The study population included 198,278 women with a median of 6.5\u00a0years of follow-up (IQR 4.2-9.0\u00a0years). There were 4002 invasive cancers, including 3077 (77%) ER/PR+HER2-, 300 (8%) TNBC, 342 (9%) ER/PR+HER2+, and 126 (3%) ER/PR-HER2+ subtype. In multivariate models, Black women had 2.7 times higher risk of TNBC than white women (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.67, 95% CI 1.99-3.58). Breast density was associated with increased risk of all subtypes. BMI was more strongly associated with ER/PR+HER2- and HER2+ subtypes among postmenopausal women than premenopausal women. Breast density was more strongly associated with ER/PR+HER2- and TNBC among premenopausal than postmenopausal women. TNBC was more likely to be interval cancer than other subtypes.These results have implications for risk assessment and understanding of the etiology of breast cancer subtypes. More research is needed to determine what factors explain the higher risk of TNBC for Black women.",
  "To investigate whether intratumoral heterogeneity, assessed via dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), reflects the molecular subtypes of invasive breast cancers.We retrospectively evaluated data from 248 consecutive women (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 54.6 \u00b1 12.2 years) with invasive breast cancer who underwent preoperative DCE-MRI and DWI between 2019 and 2020. To evaluate intratumoral heterogeneity, kinetic heterogeneity (a measure of heterogeneity in the proportions of tumor pixels with delayed washout, plateau, and persistent components within a tumor) was assessed with DCE-MRI using a commercially available computer-aided diagnosis system. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were obtained using a region-of-interest technique, and ADC heterogeneity was calculated using the following formula: (ADC<sub>max</sub>-ADC<sub>min</sub>)/ADC<sub>mean</sub>. Possible associations between imaging-based heterogeneity values and breast cancer subtypes were analyzed.Of the 248 invasive breast cancers, 61 (24.6%) were classified as luminal A, 130 (52.4%) as luminal B, 25 (10.1%) as HER2-enriched, and 32 (12.9%) as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). There were significant differences in the kinetic and ADC heterogeneity values among tumor subtypes (p < 0.001 and p = 0.023, respectively). The TNBC showed higher kinetic and ADC heterogeneity values, whereas the HER2-enriched subtype showed higher kinetic heterogeneity values compared to the luminal subtypes. Multivariate linear analysis showed that the HER2-enriched (p < 0.001) and TNBC subtypes (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with higher kinetic heterogeneity values. The TNBC subtype (p = 0.042) was also significantly associated with higher ADC heterogeneity values.Quantitative assessments of heterogeneity in enhancement kinetics and ADC values may provide biological clues regarding the molecular subtypes of breast cancer.\u2022 Higher kinetic heterogeneity was associated with HER2-enriched and triple-negative breast cancer. \u2022 Higher ADC heterogeneity was associated with triple-negative breast cancer. \u2022 Aggressive breast cancer subtypes exhibited higher intratumoral heterogeneity based on MRI.",
  "Screening mammography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are recommended for women with ATM, CHEK2, and PALB2 pathogenic variants. However, there are few data to guide screening regimens for these women.To estimate the benefits and harms of breast cancer screening strategies using mammography and MRI at various start ages for women with ATM, CHEK2, and PALB2 pathogenic variants.This comparative modeling analysis used 2 established breast cancer microsimulation models from the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) to evaluate different screening strategies. Age-specific breast cancer risks were estimated using aggregated data from the Cancer Risk Estimates Related to Susceptibility (CARRIERS) Consortium for 32\u202f247 cases and 32\u202f544 controls in 12 population-based studies. Data on screening performance for mammography and MRI were estimated from published literature. The models simulated US women with ATM, CHEK2, or PALB2 pathogenic variants born in 1985.Screening strategies with combinations of annual mammography alone and with MRI starting at age 25, 30, 35, or 40 years until age 74 years.Estimated lifetime breast cancer mortality reduction, life-years gained, breast cancer deaths averted, total screening examinations, false-positive screenings, and benign biopsies per 1000 women screened. Results are reported as model mean values and ranges.The mean model-estimated lifetime breast cancer risk was 20.9% (18.1%-23.7%) for women with ATM pathogenic variants, 27.6% (23.4%-31.7%) for women with CHEK2 pathogenic variants, and 39.5% (35.6%-43.3%) for women with PALB2 pathogenic variants. Across pathogenic variants, annual mammography alone from 40 to 74 years was estimated to reduce breast cancer mortality by 36.4% (34.6%-38.2%) to 38.5% (37.8%-39.2%) compared with no screening. Screening with annual MRI starting at 35 years followed by annual mammography and MRI at 40 years was estimated to reduce breast cancer mortality by 54.4% (54.2%-54.7%) to 57.6% (57.2%-58.0%), with 4661 (4635-4688) to 5001 (4979-5023) false-positive screenings and 1280 (1272-1287) to 1368 (1362-1374) benign biopsies per 1000 women. Annual MRI starting at 30 years followed by mammography and MRI at 40 years was estimated to reduce mortality by 55.4% (55.3%-55.4%) to 59.5% (58.5%-60.4%), with 5075 (5057-5093) to 5415 (5393-5437) false-positive screenings and 1439 (1429-1449) to 1528 (1517-1538) benign biopsies per 1000 women. When starting MRI at 30 years, initiating annual mammography starting at 30 vs 40 years did not meaningfully reduce mean mortality rates (0.1% [0.1%-0.2%] to 0.3% [0.2%-0.3%]) but was estimated to add 649 (602-695) to 650 (603-696) false-positive screenings and 58 (41-76) to 59 (41-76) benign biopsies per 1000 women.This analysis suggests that annual MRI screening starting at 30 to 35 years followed by annual MRI and mammography at 40 years may reduce breast cancer mortality by more than 50% for women with ATM, CHEK2, and PALB2 pathogenic variants. In the setting of MRI screening, mammography prior to 40 years may offer little additional benefit.",
  "Young age is a poor prognostic factor in early stage breast cancer (BC) but its value is less established in metastatic BC (MBC). We evaluated the impact of age at MBC diagnosis on overall survival (OS) across three age groups (<40, 40 to 60 and\u00a0>\u00a060 years(y)).ESME MBC database is a national cohort, collecting retrospective data from 18 participating French cancer centers between January 01, 2008 and December 31, 2014.Among 14\u00a0403 women included, 1077 (7.5%), 6436 (44.7%) and 6890 (47.8%) pts were <40, 40-60 and\u00a0>\u00a060\u00a0y respectively. Pts <40 had significantly more aggressive presentations than other age groups: more frequent HER2+ (25.7 vs 15.3% in >60y) and triple negative subtypes (27.4 vs 14.6% in >60y), and more frequent visceral involvement (36.3 vs 29.8% in >60y). At a median follow-up of 48 months, median OS differed across age groups: 38.8, 38.4 and 35.6 months for pts <40, 40-60 and\u00a0>\u00a060y, respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Compared to pts <40y, older pts had a statistically significant higher risk of death (all causes of death included), although of limited clinical value (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.1, IC 95%:1.01-1.20). There was a significant trend for better OS in pts <40y with HER2+ and luminal diseases. A possible explanation is a greater use of anti-Her2 therapies as first-line treatments: 86.6, 81.9 and 74.9% for pts <40, 40-60 and\u00a0>\u00a060y, respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).Although young age seems associated with more aggressive presentations at diagnosis of MBC, it has no deleterious effect on OS in this large series.",
  "pN stage and breast cancer subtypes (BCS) are both well-recognized prognostic indicators. Our previous work has highlighted that patients even with the same pN stage exhibited a significant survival difference in different BCS. Given this achievement, we hypothesized that a statistical interaction might exist between pN stage and BCS. The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to compare the prognostic value of the combined pN stage and BCS (pN<sub>new</sub> stage) with either pN stage or BCS alone, and to determine if this combined new stage could serve as an alternative discriminator of outcome.We combined pN stage and BCS to create a new variable named pN<sub>new</sub> stage and then divided it into four groups: pN0<sub>new</sub>, pN1<sub>new</sub>, pN2<sub>new</sub>, and pN3<sub>new</sub>. Survival analysis was performed with the use of the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test was used for univariate analysis. For multivariate analysis, cox proportional hazard models were applied, allowing for the estimation of disease-free survival (DFS). To assess discriminatory accuracy of the models, we compared the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC), the Akaike information criterion (AIC), and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) values. Then, we used this pN<sub>new</sub> stage to generate a TN<sub>new</sub>M staging system according to the 7th AJCC staging system.A statistical interaction between pN stage and BCS was found. In multivariate survival analysis, the pN<sub>new</sub> stage has been confirmed as an independent prognostic variable of 5-year DFS. The pN<sub>new</sub> stage, with a smaller AIC or BIC value and larger AUROC, was a more powerful predictor of DFS than either pN stage or BCS alone. Results were validated in a separate cohort of patients. The TN<sub>new</sub>M stage proposed in our present study was found comparable to the new 8th AJCC edition which includes anatomic T, N, and M plus tumor grade and the status of the biomarkers Her-2, ER, and PR with respect to prognostic value for breast cancer patients.The pN<sub>new</sub> stage (combined pN stage and BCS) appears to be a more powerful predictor and discriminator for the outcome of breast cancer, as compared to pN stage or BCS alone, and the TN<sub>new</sub>M stage may serve as a simple, easy-to-use alternative to the 8th AJCC edition staging manual.",
  "Breast cancer can be classified into different molecular subtypes with important therapeutic and prognostic implications. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) increases the possibility of performing conservative surgery and allows in vivo testing of the sensitivity of the tumor. Our aim was to evaluate the pathological response to NAC in relation to the molecular phenotype and the different definitions of the pathological response.228 patients treated with NAC and subsequent surgery between 2012 and 2018 were selected from our breast cancer database. Molecular phenotypes were established based on the criteria of the St Gallen 2013 Conference. Pathological response was evaluated following Miller-Payne (breast) and Sataloff (axilla) classification systems.The most frequent molecular phenotype was luminal B/HER2 negative (30.3%), followed by luminal B/HER2 positive (26.3%), triple negative (24.6%), HER2 positive (13.2%), and luminal A (5.7%). The rate of pathological complete response (pCR) was 35.5% in breast and 15.3% in axilla. The rate of pCR considering breast and axilla together was 26.8%. The molecular phenotype with the highest rate of pCR was HER2 positive (66.7%) followed by triple negative (30.4%), luminal B/HER2 positive (21.7%), luminal B/HER2 negative (14.5%), and luminal A (7.7%) (p < 0.001). The same results were found with the different definitions of pCR we evaluated.Complete pathological response to NAC in breast cancer depends largely on the molecular phenotype of the tumor, regardless of the definition of pCR, with the highest response rates in the breast and axilla in the HER2 positive and triple negative phenotypes.",
  "There is a rising concern about treatment-associated cardiotoxicities in breast cancer patients. This study aimed to determine the time- and treatment-specific incidence of arrhythmia, heart failure, and ischemic heart disease in women diagnosed with breast cancer.A register-based matched cohort study was conducted including 8015 breast cancer patients diagnosed from 2001 to 2008 in the Stockholm-Gotland region and followed up until 2017. Time-dependent risks of arrhythmia, heart failure, and ischemic heart disease in breast cancer patients were assessed using flexible parametric models as compared to matched controls from general population. Treatment-specific effects were estimated in breast cancer patients using Cox model.Time-dependent analyses revealed long-term increased risks of arrhythmia and heart failure following breast cancer diagnosis. Hazard ratios (HRs) within the first year of diagnosis were 2.14 (95% CI = 1.63-2.81) for arrhythmia and 2.71 (95% CI = 1.70-4.33) for heart failure. HR more than 10 years following diagnosis was 1.42 (95% CI = 1.21-1.67) for arrhythmia and 1.28 (95% CI = 1.03-1.59) for heart failure. The risk for ischemic heart disease was significantly increased only during the first year after diagnosis (HR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.03-2.04). Trastuzumab and anthracyclines were associated with increased risk of heart failure. Aromatase inhibitors, but not tamoxifen, were associated with risk of ischemic heart disease. No increased risk of heart disease was identified following locoregional radiotherapy.Administration of systemic adjuvant therapies appears to be associated with increased risks of heart disease. The risk estimates observed in this study may aid adjuvant therapy decision-making and patient counseling in oncology practices.This work was supported by the Swedish Research Council (grant no: 2018-02547); Swedish Cancer Society (grant no: CAN-19-0266); and FORTE (grant no: 2016-00081).",
  "Accurate prediction of the outcome of breast cancer remains as a challenge due to its heterogeneous nature. We aimed to construct an immune-related risk signature to predict the overall outcome of breast cancer using bioinformatic approaches.In this study, transcriptome and survival data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and the Gene Expression Omnibus database were used to identify differentially expressed genes between breast cancer and normal samples. A regulatory network was constructed based on the immune-related prognostic genes and transcription factors screened from the differently expressed genes. The immune-related risk gene signature was obtained using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method and Cox regression model. The immune-related prognostic scores of breast cancer (IPSBC) calculated from the risk signature were used to group breast cancer patients by risk levels. The accuracy of IPSBC was evaluated by survival analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The independency and the relationship of IPSBC with clinicopathological characteristics and abundance of tumor-infiltrated immune cells were also investigated.A total of 4296 differentially expressed genes between breast cancer and normal samples were identified, and a total of 13 prognostic immune-related genes were eventually selected as the risk gene signature, which was an independent prognostic factor of the overall survival of breast cancer. The IPSBC stratified breast cancer patients into low- and high-risk groups. Breast cancer patients in the high-risk group were associated with worse overall outcomes, more advanced stage and less abundance of tumor-infiltrated immune cells, including B cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells compared to low-risk group.In this study, an immune-related gene signature of breast cancer was identified, which could be used as potential prognostic and therapeutic targets of breast cancer.",
  "Innovations in 3D spatial technology and augmented reality imaging driven by digital high-tech industrial science have accelerated experimental advances in breast cancer imaging and the development of medical procedures aimed to reduce invasiveness.A 57-year-old post-menopausal woman presented with screen-detected left-sided breast cancer. After undergoing all staging and pre-operative studies the patient was proposed for conservative breast surgery with tumor localization. During surgery, an experimental digital and non-invasive intra-operative localization method with augmented reality was compared with the standard pre-operative localization with carbon tattooing (institutional protocol). The breast surgeon wearing an augmented reality headset (Hololens) was able to visualize the tumor location projection inside the patient's left breast in the usual supine position.This work describes, to our knowledge, the first experimental test with a digital non-invasive method for intra-operative breast cancer localization using augmented reality to guide breast conservative surgery. In this case, a successful overlap of the previous standard pre-operative marks with carbon tattooing and tumor visualization inside the patient's breast with augmented reality was obtained.Breast cancer conservative guided surgery with augmented reality can pave the way for a digital non-invasive method for intra-operative tumor localization.",
  "To understand the association between various treatments and survival for older women with higher-risk breast cancer when controlling for patient and tumor factors.We conducted a retrospective, population-based study. Women aged 80 years or older and diagnosed between 2004 and 2017 with non-metastatic, higher-risk breast cancer were identified form the provincial cancer registry in Alberta, Canada. Higher-risk was defined as any of following: T3/4, node positive, human epidermal factor receptor-2 (Her2) positive or triple negative disease. Treatments were surgery, radiotherapy and systemic therapy (hormonal therapy, and/or chemotherapy and/or trastuzumab) or a combination of the previous. Cox regression models were used to examine the association between treatments and breast cancer specific survival (BCSS) and overall survival (OS).1369 patients were included. The median age was 84 years. 332 (24%) of women had T3-T4 tumors, 792 (58%) had nodal involvement, 130 (10%) had Her2 positive tumors, 124 (9%) had triple negative tumors. After a median follow-up of 35 months, 29.5% of patients died of breast cancer whereas 34.2% died from other causes. Patients had a lower adjusted hazard for BCSS if they had surgery (hazard ratio [HR]\u00a0=\u00a00.37 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.27, 0.51), or systemic therapy (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.75, 95%CI: 0.58, 0.98). Patients had an increased probability of breast cancer death in the first 5 years after diagnosis compared to death from other causes.Surgery and systemic therapy were associated with longer BCSS and OS. This suggests that maximizing treatments might benefit higher-risk patients.",
  "The ESR1 gene encodes Estrogen Receptor alpha (ER\u03b1), which plays a role in the tumourigenesis of breast cancer. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in intron 1 of this gene called ESR1 PvuII (rs2234693) has been reported to increase the risk of breast cancer. This study aimed to investigate the ESR1 PvuII polymorphism as a prognostic and predictive factor guiding the choice of therapy for advanced breast cancer.This retrospective study was conducted in 104 advanced breast cancer patients at Dharmais Cancer Hospital from 2011 to 2018. The ESR1 PvuII polymorphism was analysed by Sanger sequencing of DNA from primary breast tumour samples.The percentages of patients with ESR1 PvuII genotypes TT, TC, and CC were 42.3, 39.4, and 18.3%, respectively. Looking at prognosis, patients with ESR1 PvuII TC\u2009+\u2009CC had shorter overall survival than those with the TT genotype [HR\u2009=\u20091.79; 95% CI 1.05-3.04; p\u2009=\u20090.032]. As a predictive marker, TC\u2009+\u2009CC was associated with shorter survival (p\u2009=\u20090.041), but TC\u2009+\u2009CC patients on primary hormonal therapy had a median overall survival longer than TC\u2009+\u2009CC patients on primary chemotherapy (1072 vs 599\u2009days).The ESR1 PvuII TC\u2009+\u2009CC genotypes confer poor prognosis in advanced breast cancer, but these genotypes could be regarded as a good predictor of the therapeutic effect of hormonal treatment.",
  "Data on treatment and outcome of advanced breast cancer in routine practice are rare, especially concerning recurrent disease, but important to complement the results from clinical trials and to improve the standard of care. We present data on choice of systemic first-line treatment, number of treatment lines, and survival of patients treated by medical oncologists in Germany. 1395 patients recruited by 124 sites at start of first-line therapy into the ongoing, prospective German clinical cohort study TMK (Tumour Registry Breast Cancer) between February 2007 and October 2015 were analysed. The median OS was 33.8 months (95% CI 30.2-40.2) for HR-positive/HER2-negative, 38.2 months (95% CI 31.3-43.0) for HER2-positive and 16.8 months (95% CI 11.5-22.0) for triple negative breast cancer. Patients with triple negative tumours more often died before start of a third-line therapy than patients with HR-positive or HER2-positive tumours (44% vs. 25%). Use of taxane-based chemotherapies has increased since 2007, with 65% of all first-line chemotherapy-treatments containing taxanes in 2013-15 (60% HR-positive/HER2-negative, 75% HER2-positive, 56% triple negative). 52% of the patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative tumours received first-line endocrine therapy in 2013-15; when restricted to patients with only non-visceral metastases this percentage increased to 63%. To our knowledge, this is the first cohort study showing systemic first-line therapy for all subtypes of advanced breast cancer. Overall survival in the TMK is comparable to that reported by clinical trials despite the inclusion of older and comorbid patients.",
  "Results of the associations between weight change after breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis were inconsistent. The modification effects of menopausal status and endocrine therapy on the associations remain poorly understood.A total of 2016 breast cancer patients were recruited between October 2008 and January 2018 and followed up until December 31, 2019 in Guangzhou. Multivariate Cox models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for progression-free survival (PFS) in association with weight change after diagnosis.Weight loss at 2\u00a0years (HR\u2009=\u20091.34, 95% CI 0.87-2.06) or more than 2\u00a0years (HR\u2009=\u20091.95, 95% CI 1.22-3.10) after diagnosis increased risk of breast cancer progression. The adverse effect of weight loss was significantly more pronounced in post-menopausal than pre-menopausal women, particularly for weight loss at 2\u00a0years after diagnosis, with the HRs and 95% CIs of 2.41 (1.25-4.63) and 0.90 (0.49-1.64), respectively. Weight gain tended to reduce the risk of disease progression among patients with endocrine therapy but not for those with non-endocrine therapy; the significant interaction between weight gain at 2\u00a0years after diagnosis and endocrine therapy was observed (P<sub>interaction</sub>\u2009=\u20090.042).Our finding suggested that weight loss was detrimental to breast cancer prognosis, particularly for post-menopausal women, while weight gain may be a potential beneficial indicator for the patients with endocrine therapy but not for those with non-endocrine therapy.",
  "Although chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) after breast cancer surgery is a common and prevalent postsurgical adverse event, the need for CPSP treatment has not been investigated. This study examined the proportion of patients who needed treatment for CPSP and associated predictors.We conducted a cross-sectional study with female patients who underwent breast cancer surgery at our institution. Participants were aged\u2009\u2264\u200965\u00a0years at the time of this study and were at least 1\u00a0year post surgery. The questionnaire examined the presence of and need for treatment for CPSP and included the Japanese version of the Concerns about Recurrence Scale (CARS-J). Multivariate analyses were used to identify independent predictors of needing treatment for CPSP.In total, 305 patients completed the questionnaire. The mean time since surgery was 67.1\u00a0months; 156 (51%) patients developed CPSP after breast cancer surgery and 61 (39%) needed treatment for CPSP. Among patients that developed CPSP, the fear of breast cancer recurrence as assessed by the CARS-J (odds ratio [OR] 2.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-6.28, P\u2009=\u20090.028) and\u2009\u2265\u20092 postsurgical pain regions (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.16-5.57, P\u2009=\u20090.020) were independent predictors of needing treatment for CPSP.This study is the first to identify the proportion and predictors of patients who need treatment for CPSP. Fear of breast cancer recurrence and\u2009\u2265\u20092 postsurgical pain regions may predict the need for CPSP treatment among patients following breast cancer surgery.",
  "To assess morphology on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and intratumoral signal intensity (SI) on T2-weighted images (T2WI) of breast carcinomas, and to evaluate the association between the combined DWI and T2WI findings and breast cancer subtypes.Two hundred and eighty breast cancer patients who underwent breast MRI prior to therapy were included in this retrospective study. All had invasive carcinomas, which were classified into five subtypes: Luminal A-like (n\u2009=\u2009149), Luminal B-like (n\u2009=\u200963), Hormone receptor-positive HER2 (n\u2009=\u200931), Hormone receptor-negative HER2 (n\u2009=\u200913), or Triple-negative (TN) (n\u2009=\u200924). Based on the morphology on DWI, the tumors were classified into two patterns: DWI-homogeneous or DWI-heterogeneous. If DWI-heterogeneous, an assessment of intratumoral SI on T2WI was performed: tumors with intratumoral high/low SI on T2WI were classified as Hete-H/Hete-L, respectively. The associations between (1) the morphological patterns on DWI and the five subtypes, and (2) the intratumoral SI patterns on T2WI and the five subtypes in DWI-heterogeneous were evaluated.There was a significant association between (1) the morphological patterns on DWI and the five subtypes (p\u2009<\u20090.0001), and (2) the intratumoral SI patterns on T2WI and the five subtypes in DWI-heterogeneous (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). DWI-homogeneous was dominant in Luminal A-like (67.1%), and Hete-H was dominant in TN type (75%). Hete-H, suggesting the presence of intratumoral necrosis, included high proliferative and/or aggressive subtypes more frequently (80%) than Hete-L, suggesting the presence of fibrotic focus. Fibrotic focus was seen more commonly in the luminal subtypes.The combined findings on DWI and T2WI revealed breast carcinomas that were associated with particular subtypes.",
  "In breast cancer, FoxP3-positive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (FoxP3+\u2009TILs) vary depending on lymph node status, histological grade, and subtype. All these studies have compared the numbers of FoxP3+\u2009TILs among different hosts, but recruitment of FoxP3+\u2009TILs might depend on each individual's immune environment and each tumor's biological characteristics. In the present study, FoxP3+\u2009TIL numbers were investigated in patients with synchronous bilateral breast cancer (SBBC) to determine the factors that affect FoxP3+\u2009TIL recruitment in the same anti-tumor immune environment.Patients diagnosed with SBBC who underwent curative surgery at two institutions were enrolled in this study. Patients who underwent primary systemic therapy or who were diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ or who had distant metastases at diagnosis were excluded. The average numbers of Foxp3+\u2009TILs were determined from the scores of five high-power microscopic fields (HPF). The associations between Foxp3+\u2009TIL numbers and the clinicopathological features of bilateral breasts in a single individual were examined.Nuclear grade (NG) (p\u2009=\u20090.007) and subtype (p\u2009=\u20090.03), but not size (p\u2009=\u20090.18) and axillary lymph node (p\u2009=\u20090.23) were significantly associated with increase of FoxP3\u2009+\u2009TIL numbers by univariate analysis. Further, only NG was a statistically significant clinicopathological factor for change in the number of FoxP3+\u2009TILs by multivariate analysis (p\u2009=\u20090.046) CONCLUSIONS: There was no relationship between FoxP3+\u2009TIL numbers and cancer progression as reflected in tumor size and axillary lymph node in patients with SBBC. Aggressive biological factors, especially high NG, were significantly related to enhanced recruitment of FoxP3+\u2009TILs.",
  "Approval of eribulin for metastatic breast cancer was based on data primarily from Western patients, and there is a paucity of data on the effectiveness and safety of eribulin for Asian patients. To determine the effectiveness and safety of eribulin in Korean women with breast cancer in a real-world setting, we conducted a nationwide, multicenter, retrospective study.Patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who were treated with eribulin in 14 centers throughout Korea were included in this study. Eribulin was generally administered at a dose of 1.23\u00a0mg/m<sup>2</sup> (equivalent to 1.4\u00a0mg/m<sup>2</sup> eribulin mesylate) by intravenous infusion for 2-5\u00a0min, or as a diluted solution, on Days 1 and 8 of every 21-day cycle. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 6 months. Secondary endpoints included median PFS, overall survival (OS), time-to-treatment failure (TTF), tumor response rate, and incidence of hematologic treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).The safety and full analysis populations included 398 and 360 (38 had no efficacy data) patients, respectively. The PFS rate at 6 months was 37.8%. Median PFS, OS, and TTF were 134, 631, and 120 days, respectively. Objective response rate, clinical benefit rate, and disease control rate were 18.1%, 50.6%, and 49.4%, respectively. Hematologic TEAEs were reported in 65.1% of patients; neutropenia (56.8%) and anemia (11.3%) were most common.Real-world effectiveness and safety of eribulin in Korean breast cancer patients were consistent with previous reports; no new safety concerns were identified.",
  "Metastatic regional lymph nodes (LN) is a strong predictor of worse long-term outcome. Therefore, different LN staging systems have been proposed in recent years. In this study, we proposed a modified lymph node ratio (mLNR) as a new lymph node staging system and then compared the prognostic performance of mLNR with American Joint Committee on Cancer N stage, lymph node ratio (LNR) and log odds of metastatic lymph nodes in breast cancer patients.Breast cancer patients who underwent surgery between 2004 and 2012 were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Restricted cubic spline functions were calculated to characterize the association between variables and the risk of death. The Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to assess the predictive ability of different lymph node staging systems using the Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and Harrell's concordance index (C-index).A total of 264,096 breast cancer patients were enrolled and 187,785 (71.1%) patients had a limited number of LNs harvested. In the limited LN harvest cohort, the prognostic performance of LNR decreased and mLNR could greatly solve this problem. In addition, among the entire cohort, mLNR modeled as a continuous value had the best predictive ability (AIC: 922021.9 and C-index: 0.727) than other lymph node staging systems.The predictive ability of LNR is restricted by a limited LN harvest. However, mLNR shows superiority to LNR and other lymph node staging systems especially in a limited LN harvest cohort, making mLNR the most powerful lymph node staging systems.",
  "Earlier age at menarche is an established risk factor for breast cancer. While age at menarche has been fairly stable over the past half-century, age at breast development (thelarche) has continued to decrease. Recently, earlier age at thelarche and a longer time between thelarche and menarche (pubertal tempo) were shown to be associated with increased breast cancer risk. Our objective was to examine how breast cancer risk was associated with pubertal timing and tempo in a prospective US cohort.Women ages 35-74\u2009years without a history of breast cancer, but who had a sister previously diagnosed with breast cancer, were enrolled in the Sister Study from 2003 to 2009 (N\u00a0=\u200950,884). At enrollment, participants reported their ages at thelarche and menarche. Pubertal tempo was age at menarche minus age at thelarche. We estimated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each pubertal milestone and risk of breast cancer (invasive or ductal carcinoma in situ) using Cox proportional hazards regression. We examined whether associations between age at thelarche and breast cancer risk were modified by birth cohort, race/ethnicity, weight at age 10, and extent of breast cancer family history, as characterized by a Bayesian score based on first-degree family structure.During follow-up (mean\u2009=\u20099.3\u2009years), 3295 eligible women were diagnosed with breast cancer. Early ages at thelarche (HR\u2009=\u20091.23, 95% CI 1.03-1.46 for <\u200910 vs. 12-13\u2009years) and menarche (HR\u2009=\u20091.10, 95% CI 1.01-1.20 for <\u200912 vs. 12-13\u2009years) were positively associated with breast cancer risk. Pubertal tempo was not associated with breast cancer risk (HR\u2009=\u20090.99, 95% CI 0.97-1.02 per 1-year longer tempo). When considering early thelarche (<\u200910\u2009years) and early menarche (<\u200912\u2009years) jointly, women with both had a 30% greater risk of breast cancer compared with women with neither risk factor (95% CI 1.07-1.57). The association between age at thelarche and breast cancer risk did not significantly vary by birth cohort, race/ethnicity, childhood weight, or Bayesian family history score.Earlier ages at thelarche and menarche may enhance susceptibility to breast carcinogenesis. Age at thelarche is an important risk factor to consider given secular trends towards earlier development.",
  "To evaluate the effect of the 21-gene recurrence score (RS) assay in breast cancer-specific mortality (BCSM) and decision-making for chemotherapy in older (aged \u226565 years) breast cancer.We retrospectively included older patients with T1-2N0 and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Cox regression model and competing-risks model were used for data analysis.This study included 8524 patients, 1987 (23.3%) had low RS, 5059 (59.4%) had intermediate RS, and 1478 (17.3%) had high RS. Chemotherapy was administrated in 2.0%, 8.6%, and 51.2% for low, intermediate, and high RS cohorts, respectively (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). A total of 597 deaths were recorded, including one-quarter of breast cancer-related deaths and three-quarters as competing causes of death. The 5-year BCSM was 5.4%, 4.7%, and 9.1% for low, intermediate, and high RS cohorts, respectively (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), using the Cox regression model, and was 0.8%, 0.9%, and 5.2% for low, intermediate, and high RS cohorts using the competing-risks regression, respectively (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). RS was independently correlated with BCSM in both prognostic models. The stratified analysis demonstrated that chemotherapy was not correlated with a lower risk of BCSM in intermediate and high RS cohorts in both prognostic models. Sensitivity analyses replicated similar findings after stratification by the year of diagnosis and patients' age.The competing-risks model is useful in dealing with multiple end events for older breast cancer patients. 21-gene RS was independently associated with BCSM. However, chemotherapy did not significantly decrease the risk of BCSM in intermediate and high RS cohorts.",
  "The optimal number of cycles of adjuvant docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (DC) in patients with node negative breast cancer is not known. We aimed to analyse the survival outcomes of patients with node negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2)-negative breast cancer treated with four cycles of DC.Patients with node negative and HER2-negative breast cancer treated with four cycles of DC after surgery in a large Canadian province from 2008 to 2012 were identified. We analysed the 4-year and 9-year invasive disease free survival (iDFS) and overall survival (OS). Cox regression models were constructed to examine the associations of clinical characteristics with survival outcomes.A total of 657 patients were eligible for the current analysis. The median age was 53 years and 71.2% of patients had hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Approximately three-fourths of patients had grade III tumours. At a median follow-up of nine years, the 4-year iDFS and OS were 91.0% and 95.5% and the corresponding 9-year rates were 80.5% and 88.0%, respectively. On multivariable Cox regression analysis, grade III tumour predicted worse iDFS (hazard ratio [HR], 2.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-4.21; P\u00a0=\u00a00.026) and OS (HR, 3.15; 95% CI, 1.18-8.45; P\u00a0=\u00a00.022).Adjuvant chemotherapy with four cycles of DC in a select population of node negative breast cancer was associated with encouraging long-term survival. In the absence of a randomized comparison between four and six cycles of DC, this study presents real-world evidence to consider four cycles of DC as a reasonable option.",
  "Health-related quality of life and utility scores of patients with breast cancer and precancerous lesions are sparse in China. This study aimed to derive utility scores of patients with breast cancer and precancer in China.An interviewer-administered cross-sectional survey was conducted in 12 provinces across China from 2013 to 2014. The three-level EuroQol-5-Dimension instrument was used to evaluate quality of life, and utility scores were generated using the Chinese value set. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to explore the determinants of utility scores.In total, 2626 breast cancer and 471 precancer patients were included. Mean age was 49.1 for breast cancer and 41.4 years for precancer (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Among the five dimensions, pain/discomfort was the most reported problem, 53.9% in breast cancer and 29.3% in precancer patients. Mean (95% CI) utility scores for breast cancer and precancer patients were estimated as 0.887 (0.875-0.899) and 0.781 (0.774-0.788), and the scores of breast cancer at stage-I, stage-II, stage-III and stage-IV were 0.789 (0.774-0.805), 0.793 (0.783-0.802), 0.774 (0.759-0.788) and 0.686 (0.654-0.717), respectively. Mean (95% CI) visual analogue scale scores for breast cancer and precancer were 75.6 (74.0-77.3) and 72.8 (72.3-73.3). Multiple regression showed advanced clinical stage, lower educational level, lower household income, surgery treatment, and undergoing treatment were independently associated with lower utility scores for breast cancer patients.The utility scores deteriorate with the severity of breast neoplasms. Detailed utility scores of breast cancer and precancer are fundamental for further cost-utility analysis in China.",
  "Earlier diagnosis and improved treatments have led to better outcomes in breast cancer, making quality of life a key issue. Sexuality represents a pillar of quality of life, although it is often neglected by both healthcare providers and patients when it comes to cancer. This study aims to explore the differences in sexual functioning, distress, psychopathology, emotions, and cognitions between breast cancer patients under hormonal treatment and controls.Seventy-nine women (age range between 24 and 69\u00a0years) in hormonal therapy for breast cancer completed a self-reported protocol. A matched control group of 103 women was randomly extracted from an Italian general population database. Eight self-report questionnaires exploring biopsychosocial factors were administered.The current study showed an impaired sexuality in breast cancer patients compared to controls. Breast cancer women under hormonal treatment were characterized by diminished or absent sexual activity (chi<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u200936.16; p\u2009<\u20090.001), lower level of sexual functioning in all areas except for pain (F<sub>(1,180)</sub>\u2009=\u20098.1; p\u2009<\u20090.01), higher sexual (F<sub>(1,180)</sub>\u2009=\u200910.08; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and psychological distress (F<sub>(1,180)</sub>\u2009=\u20096.23; p\u2009<\u20090.05), higher scores in Difficulties in Identifying Feelings (F<sub>(1,180)</sub>\u2009=\u20097.31; p\u2009<\u20090.01) and Externally Oriented Thinking (F<sub>(1,180)</sub>\u2009=\u20096.64; p\u2009<\u20090.05), higher level of negative emotions related to sexuality (F<sub>(1,180)</sub>\u2009=\u200911.13; p\u2009<\u20090.001), and more rigid cognition towards peculiar aspects of sexuality, such as Failure Disengagement Thoughts (F<sub>(1,180)</sub>\u2009=\u200922.01; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and Age related Beliefs (F<sub>(1,180)</sub>\u2009=\u20095.7; p\u2009<\u20090.05).Health care providers do not usually assess those issues in their routine practice, so that sexuality remains an unmet need with remarkable effects on general health and quality of life.",
  "Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) MAF BZIP transcription factor G antisense RNA 1 (MAFG\u2011AS1) has been demonstrated to serve an important role in the progression of various types of cancer, whereas its role in breast cancer has not been fully elucidated. The present study aimed to explore the potential role and underlying mechanism of MAFG\u2011AS1 in breast cancer. To achieve this, the expression of MAFG\u2011AS1, microRNA (miR)\u2011150\u20115p and MYB was detected by reverse transcription\u2011quantitative PCR. The binding between miR\u2011150\u20115p and MAFG\u2011AS1 or MYB was verified using a luciferase reporter assay. Cell proliferation was analyzed by MTS, apoptosis and cell cycle were detected by Annexin V/propidium iodide, and cell migration was analyzed by wound healing assay. The results demonstrated that the expression levels of MAFG\u2011AS1 were significantly upregulated in breast cancer tissues and cells compared with those in normal breast tissues and cells. High MAFG\u2011AS1 expression promoted the proliferation, migration and epithelial\u2011mesenchymal transition of breast cancer cells. By contrast, miR\u2011150\u20115p expression was reduced in breast cancer tissues compared with that in healthy breast tissues, and low expression of miR\u2011150\u20115p was associated with poor overall survival in patients with breast cancer. Bioinformatics and luciferase assay revealed that MAFG\u2011AS1 served as a sponge of miR\u2011150\u20115p, and that miR\u2011150\u20115p bound to MYB. The functional rescue assay results demonstrated that MAFG\u2011AS1 knockdown suppressed the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells by regulating miR\u2011150\u20115p, which in turn targeted MYB. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that MAFG\u2011AS1 functioned as a novel oncogenic lncRNA in the development of human breast cancer via regulating the miR\u2011150\u20115p/MYB axis, which suggested that MAFG\u2011AS1 may be a novel biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of human breast cancer.",
  "Fewer than 1% of all breast cancers occur in men. As a result, a distinct lack of data exists regarding the management and outcomes in this cohort.Any male patient with pathologically confirmed breast cancer diagnosed between August 2000 and October 2017 at either Massachusetts General Hospital or Brigham and Women's Hospital/Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and their affiliate satellite locations were included. Primary chart review was used to assess clinical and pathologic characteristics. Patient and treatment variables were reported via descriptive statistics. Local-regional failure (LRF), overall survival (OS), breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.100 patients were included in this study. Median follow-up was 112\u00a0months (range 1-220\u00a0months). Approximately 1/3 of patients experienced at least a 3-month delay to presentation. 83 patients ultimately underwent mastectomy as definitive surgical treatment. 46 patients received adjuvant radiation therapy, and 37 patients received chemotherapy. Of 82 hormone receptor-positive patients with invasive cancer, 94% (n\u2009=\u200977) received endocrine therapy. Of the fifty-eight patients who underwent genetic testing, 15 (26%) tested positive. The 5-year OS, BCSS, DFS, and LRF rates were 91.5%, 96.2%, 86%, and 4.8%, respectively. Delay to presentation was not associated with worse survival.Male breast cancer remains a rare diagnosis. Despite this, the majority of patients in this study received standard of care therapy and experienced excellent oncologic outcomes. Penetration for genetic testing improved over time.",
  "SPTBN1 (spectrin beta, non-erythrocytic 1) has been linked to tumor progression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the role of SPTBN1 has yet to be investigated in breast cancer. This study aimed to evaluate the viability, growth, and migration ability of the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and BT549 using CCK-8 assay, xenograft models, and Transwell assays. The expression of SPTBN1, EMT-related genes, and miRNA21 in breast cancer cells and tissues were assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot. SPTBN1 staining of breast cancer tissues was analyzed by the Human Protein Atlas databases. Both chromatin immunoprecipitation qPCR and immunofluorescence were performed to detect how SPTBN1 regulates miRNA21. Our results showed that the expression of SPTBN1 in primary breast cancer tumors was dramatically lower than that in normal tissues and that lower levels of SPTBN1 were associated with significantly shorter progression-free survival. We also discovered that the loss of SPTBN1 promotes EMT, the viability of MDA-MB-231 and BT549 in vitro, and the growth of MDA-MB-231 tumor xenografts in vivo by upregulating miR-21 level. Furthermore, loss of SPTBN1-mediated miR-21 upregulation was dependent on the stability and nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65. Therefore, SPTBN1 is a pivotal regulator that inhibits EMT and the growth of breast cancer.",
  "In Europe, inappropriate reimbursement and funding rules and regulations act as disincentives to best breast cancer care or, at worst, hinder best care. This problem was the focus of the 12th European Breast Cancer Conference (EBCC) manifesto, discussed during the virtual conference. As patient involvement is indispensable in driving changes to clinical practice, Europa Donna the European patient advocacy group was closely involved in the 12th manifesto. Reimbursement policies have rarely evolved with advances in breast cancer care such as outpatient (ambulatory) care rather than inpatient admission, use of oral or subcutaneous anti-cancer drugs rather than day-hospital intravenous administration, oncoplastic surgery techniques to minimize mastectomy rates, breast reconstructive surgery, risk-reducing surgery for BRCA mutation carriers, or use of hypo-fractionated breast radiation therapy. Although each European country, region and centre will have to understand how their reimbursement policies may hinder best care and find their own solutions, the problems are similar throughout Europe and some solutions can be broadly applied. This manifesto is not calling for more funding or demanding changes that will result in more expensive care. Reimbursement, if better aligned with guidelines and optimal clinical practice, will deliver more cost-effective healthcare. This will release resources, support more equitable use of finite funding and resources, so allowing more European breast cancer patients to benefit from evidence-based treatment recommended by national and international guidelines.",
  "Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) is more intense in younger women. Because FCR is a powerful determinant of quality of life, identifying those at risk for persistently elevated FCR can inform timing of interventions.A total of 965 women with stage 0 to stage III breast cancer enrolled in the Young Women's Breast Cancer Study, a prospective cohort of women diagnosed with breast cancer at age \u226440 years, completed the 3-item Lasry Fear of Recurrence Index. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to classify distinct FCR patterns from baseline through 5 years post-diagnosis. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify patient, disease, and treatment characteristics associated with each trajectory.Five FCR trajectories were identified with the majority of participants having moderate (33.1%) or high FCR (27.6%) that improved over time. A total of 6.9% participants had moderate FCR that worsened, whereas 21.7% had high FCR at baseline that remained high throughout. In the fully adjusted multinomial model, stages II and III (vs stage I) were associated with lower odds (of being in the high/stable trajectory). White (vs non-White) were associated with higher odds of being in a trajectory that improved over time.Although FCR improves over time for many young women with breast cancer, approximately one-third had FCR that was severe and did not improve or worsened over 5 years after diagnosis. Ongoing monitoring is warranted, with early referral to mental health professionals indicated for those at highest risk for unresolved FCR.Fear of recurrence is common among young women with breast cancer. The authors followed a large cohort of young women diagnosed with breast cancer when they were 40 years of age and younger, and found 5 distinct trajectories that show moderate and severe fears do not always improve over time and may require targeted mental health intervention.",
  "Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) was developed with the expectation of improving cancer detection in women with dense breasts. Studies are needed to evaluate interval invasive and advanced breast cancer rates, intermediary outcomes related to breast cancer mortality, by breast density and breast cancer risk.To evaluate whether DBT screening is associated with a lower likelihood of interval invasive cancer and advanced breast cancer compared with digital mammography by extent of breast density and breast cancer risk.Cohort study of 504\u202f427 women aged 40 to 79 years who underwent 1\u202f003\u202f900 screening digital mammography and 375\u202f189 screening DBT examinations from 2011 through 2018 at 44 US Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) facilities with follow-up for cancer diagnoses through 2019 by linkage to state or regional cancer registries.Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) breast density; BCSC 5-year breast cancer risk.Rates per 1000 examinations of interval invasive cancer within 12 months of screening mammography and advanced breast cancer (prognostic pathologic stage II or higher) within 12 months of screening mammography, both estimated with inverse probability weighting.Among 504\u202f427 women in the study population, the median age at time of mammography was 58 years (IQR, 50-65 years). Interval invasive cancer rates per 1000 examinations were not significantly different for DBT vs digital mammography (overall, 0.57 vs 0.61, respectively; difference, -0.04; 95% CI, -0.14 to 0.06; P\u2009=\u2009.43) or among all the 836\u202f250 examinations with BCSC 5-year risk less than 1.67% (low to average-risk) or all the 413\u202f061 examinations with BCSC 5-year risk of 1.67% or higher (high risk) across breast density categories. Advanced cancer rates were not significantly different for DBT vs digital mammography among women at low to average risk or at high risk with almost entirely fatty, scattered fibroglandular densities, or heterogeneously dense breasts. Advanced cancer rates per 1000 examinations were significantly lower for DBT vs digital mammography for the 3.6% of women with extremely dense breasts and at high risk of breast cancer (13\u202f291 examinations in the DBT group and 31\u202f300 in the digital mammography group; 0.27 vs 0.80 per 1000 examinations; difference, -0.53; 95% CI, -0.97 to -0.10) but not for women at low to average risk (10\u202f611 examinations in the DBT group and 37\u202f796 in the digital mammography group; 0.54 vs 0.42 per 1000 examinations; difference, 0.12; 95% CI, -0.09 to 0.32).Screening with DBT vs digital mammography was not associated with a significant difference in risk of interval invasive cancer and was associated with a significantly lower risk of advanced breast cancer among the 3.6% of women with extremely dense breasts and at high risk of breast cancer. No significant difference was observed in the 96.4% of women with nondense breasts, heterogeneously dense breasts, or with extremely dense breasts not at high risk.",
  "Breast cancer is the primary cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Tamoxifen (TAM) is the preferred drug for treating premenopausal luminal-type breast cancer, but TAM resistance restricts its ability to benefit patients. To date, the mechanism of this resistance remains unclear, and there is currently no effective treatment for reversing it. The expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) has been shown to be elevated in various malignancies. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of IDO1 in TAM-resistant breast cancer. We confirmed that IDO1 is strongly expressed in TAM-resistant breast cancer, and it mediates drug-resistant cell proliferation, metastasis, and TAM resistance in vivo and in vitro through interleukin-6/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (IL-6/STAT3). We also found that the mechanism by which TAM upregulates IDO1 is dependent on STAT1 activation. In summary, IDO1 regulates TAM resistance and can serve as a novel target for treatment of TAM-resistant breast cancer.",
  "Breast-conserving therapy was once a contraindication in young breast cancer patients (aged \u226440 years). Emerging studies suggest that breast-conserving therapy and mastectomy could achieve similar prognosis in this population. However, the effect of molecular subtype disparity on surgical strategy in these patients remains unclear. Data from 8656 young patients (aged \u226440 years) diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between in 2010 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate subtype-dependent relationships between the surgical method and survival. Of the 8656 patients, 4132 (47.7%) underwent breast-conserving therapy and 4524 (52.3%) underwent mastectomy. The median follow-up period was 30.0 months. Patients in the breast-conserving therapy group demonstrated better overall survival and breast cancer-specific survival than those in the mastectomy group (both <i>p</i> < 0.05). Patients with different molecular subtypes exhibited significant differences in overall survival and breast cancer-specific survival (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Patients with luminal subtypes experienced better overall survival and breast cancer-specific survival than those with the triple-negative subtype. Multivariate analysis revealed that overall mortality risk of the breast-conserving therapy group was lower than that of the mastectomy group among HR(+)HER-2(-) and HR(-)HER-2(-) patients (overall mortality risk of 36.3% [adjusted hazard ratio = 0.637 {95% confidence interval = 0.448-0.905}, p = 0.012] and 36.0% [adjusted hazard ratio = 0.640 {95% confidence interval = 0.455-0.901}, p = 0.010] respectively.) The breast cancer-specific mortality risk was also lower by a percentage similar to that of the overall mortality risk. In the HR(+)HER-2(+) group, the surgical method was an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer-specific survival (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.275 [95% confidence interval = 0.089-0.849], <i>p</i> = 0.025), while there was a trend that patients with breast-conserving therapy had better overall survival than those with mastectomy (<i>p</i> = 0.056). In the HR(-)HER-2(+) group, no significant difference was observed in overall survival and breast cancer-specific survival (<i>p</i> = 0.791 and <i>p</i> = 0.262, respectively). Breast-conserving therapy resulted in significantly better prognosis in patients with luminal and triple-negative subtypes, while no significant difference was observed in patients with the HER-2 enriched subtype. These results may be helpful in informing clinically precise decision-making for surgery in this population.",
  "Luminal B-like breast cancer is sensitive to both chemotherapy and endocrine therapy. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of concomitant chemotherapy and endocrine therapy compared with chemotherapy alone in the preoperative setting in luminal B-like breast cancer.This two-arm randomized clinical trial enrolled patients with luminal B-like human epithelial growth factor 2-negative breast cancer, who were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to receive preoperative chemotherapy alone or preoperative endocrine therapy concurrent with chemotherapy for 24\u00a0weeks before surgery. The primary endpoint was the pathological complete response (pCR) rate. The secondary endpoints included the clinical response rate, toxicity, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL).Overall, 70 patients were randomly assigned to the chemotherapy and chemo-endocrine therapy groups. The pCR rates were 9.7% and 3.0% (P\u2009=\u20090.319), and the clinical complete response rates were 5.9% and 5.6% (P\u2009=\u20090.745) in the chemotherapy and chemo-endocrine therapy groups, respectively. There were no clear differences in treatment-related adverse events or HRQOL between the two groups.In patients with luminal B-like breast cancer, the pCR, clinical response rate, toxicity, and HRQOL with the concomitant administration of endocrine therapy and chemotherapy were not superior to chemotherapy alone in the preoperative setting.",
  "Over 50% of breast tumors harbor alterations in one or more genes of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway including PIK3CA mutations (31%), PTEN loss (34%), PTEN mutations (5%) and AKT1 mutations (3%). While PI3K and mTOR inhibitors are already approved in advanced breast cancer, AKT inhibitors have been recently developed as a new therapeutic approach. Capivasertib (AZD5363) is a novel, selective ATP-competitive pan-AKT kinase inhibitor that exerts similar activity against the three AKT isoforms, AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3. Preclinical studies demonstrated efficacy of capivasertib in breast cancer cell lines as a single agent or in combination with anti-HER2 agents and endocrine treatment, especially in tumors with PIK3CA or MTOR alterations. Phase I/II studies demonstrated greater efficacy when capivasertib was co-administered with paclitaxel, fulvestrant in hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer or olaparib. The recommended phase II dose of capivasertib as monotherapy was 480\u00a0mg bid on a 4-days-on, 3-days-off dosing schedule. Toxicity profile proved to be manageable with hyperglycemia (20-24%), diarrhea (14-17%) and maculopapular rash (11-16%) being the most common grade \u22653 adverse events. Ongoing Phase III trials of capivasertib in combination with fulvestrant (CAPItello-291), CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib (CAPItello-292) and paclitaxel (CAPItello- 290) will better clarify the therapeutic role of capivasertib in breast cancer.",
  "Symptomatic breast cancers share aggressive clinico-pathological characteristics compared to screen-detected breast cancers. We assessed the association between the method of cancer detection and genomic and clinical risk, and its effect on adjuvant chemotherapy recommendations.Patients with early hormone receptor positive (HR+) HER2neu-negative (HER2-) breast cancer, and known OncotypeDX Breast Recurrence Score test were included. A natural language processing (NLP) algorithm was used to identify the method of cancer detection. The clinical and genomic risks of symptomatic and screen-detected tumors were compared.The NLP algorithm identified the method of detection of 401 patients, with 216 (54%) diagnosed by routine screening, and the remainder secondary to symptoms. The distribution of OncotypeDX recurrence score (RS) varied between the groups. In the symptomatic group there were lower proportions of low RS (13% vs 23%) and higher proportions of high RS (24% vs. 13%) compared to the screen-detected group. Symptomatic tumors were significantly more likely to have a high clinical risk (59% vs 40%). Based on genomic and clinical risk and current guidelines, we found that women aged 50 and under, with a symptomatic cancer, had an increased probability of receiving adjuvant chemotherapy recommendation compared to women with screen-detected cancers (60% vs. 37%).We demonstrated an association between the method of cancer detection and both genomic and clinical risk. Symptomatic breast cancer, especially in young women, remains a poor prognostic factor that should be taken into account when evaluating patient prognosis and determining adjuvant treatment plans.",
  "Experimental studies indicate that neuroendocrine pathways might play a role in progression of breast cancer. We aim to test the hypothesis that somatic mutations in the genes of neuroendocrine pathways influence breast cancer prognosis, through dysregulated gene expression in tumor tissue.We conducted an extreme case-control study including 208 breast cancer patients with poor invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) and 208 patients with favorable iDFS who were individually matched on molecular subtype from the Breast Cancer Cohort at West China Hospital (WCH; N\u2009=\u2009192) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; N\u2009=\u2009224). Whole exome sequencing and RNA sequencing of tumor and paired normal breast tissues were performed. Adrenergic, glucocorticoid, dopaminergic, serotonergic, and cholinergic pathways were assessed for differences in mutation burden and gene expression in relation to breast cancer iDFS using the logistic regression and global test, respectively.In the pooled analysis, presence of any somatic mutation (odds ratio\u2009=\u20091.66, 95% CI: 1.07-2.58) of the glucocorticoid pathway was associated with poor iDFS and a two-fold increase of tumor mutation burden was associated with 17% elevated odds (95% CI: 2-35%), after adjustment for cohort membership, age, menopausal status, molecular subtype, and tumor stage. Differential expression of genes in the glucocorticoid pathway in tumor tissue (P\u2009=\u20090.028), but not normal tissue (P\u2009=\u20090.701), was associated with poor iDFS. Somatic mutation of the adrenergic and cholinergic pathways was significantly associated with iDFS in WCH, but not in TCGA.Glucocorticoid pathway may play a role in breast cancer prognosis through differential mutations and expression. Further characterization of its functional role may open new avenues for the development of novel therapeutic targets for breast cancer.",
  "Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling and control of local bioavailability of free IGF by the IGF binding proteins (IGFBP) are important regulators of both mammary development and breast cancer. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified small nucleotide polymorphisms that reduce the expression of IGFBP-5 as a risk factor of developing breast cancer. This observation suggests that genetic alterations leading to a decreased level of IGFBP-5 may also contribute to breast cancer. In the current review, we focus on Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein A (PAPP-A), a protease involved in the degradation of IGFBP-5. PAPP-A is overexpressed in the majority of breast cancers but its role in cancer has only begun to be explored. More specifically, this review aims at highlighting the role of post-partum involution in the oncogenic function of PAPP-A. Notably, we summarize recent studies indicating that PAPP-A plays a role not only in the degradation of IGFBP-5 but also in the deposition of collagen and activation of the collagen receptor discoidin 2 (DDR2) during post-partum involution. Finally, considering the immunosuppressive microenvironment of post-partum involution, we also discuss the unexpected finding made in Ewing Sarcoma that PAPP-A plays a role in immune evasion. While the immunosuppressive role of PAPP-A in breast cancer remains to be determined, collectively these studies highlight the multifaced role of PAPP-A in cancer that extends well beyond its effect on IGF-signaling.",
  "The purpose of this review is to clarify the association of body composition with breast cancer risk and treatment, including physiological mechanisms, and to elucidate strategies for overcoming unfavorable body composition changes that relate to breast cancer progression.We have summarized updated knowledge regarding the mechanism of the negative association of altered body composition with breast cancer risk and treatment. We also review strategies for reversing unfavorable body composition based on the latest clinical trial results.Body composition changes in patients with breast cancer typically occur during menopause or as a result of chemotherapy or endocrine therapy. Dysfunction of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in the setting of obesity underlies insulin resistance and chronic inflammation, which can lead to breast cancer development and progression. Insulin resistance and chronic inflammation are also observed in patients with breast cancer who have sarcopenia or sarcopenic obesity. Nutritional support and a personalized exercise program are the fundamental interventions for reversing unfavorable body composition. Other interventions that have been explored in specific situations include metformin, testosterone, emerging agents that directly target the adipocyte microenvironment, and bariatric surgery.A better understanding of the biology of body composition phenotypes is key to determining the best intervention program for patients with breast cancer.",
  "Breast density is associated with breast cancer risk in women aged 40 to 65 years, but there is limited evidence of its association with risk of breast cancer among women aged 65 years or older.To compare the association between breast density and risk of invasive breast cancer among women aged 65 to 74 years vs women aged 75 years or older and to evaluate whether the association is modified by body mass index (BMI).This prospective cohort study used data from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium from January 1, 1996, to December 31, 2012, for US women aged 65 years or older who underwent screening mammography. Data were analyzed from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2020.Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System breast density category, age, and BMI.The 5-year cumulative incidence of invasive breast cancer by level of breast density (almost entirely fat, scattered fibroglandular densities, or heterogeneous or extreme density) and age (65-74 vs \u226575 years) was calculated using weighted means. Cox proportional hazards models were fit to estimate the association of breast density with invasive breast cancer risk. The likelihood ratio test was used to test the interaction between BMI and breast density.A total of 221\u202f714 screening mammograms from 193\u202f787 women were included in the study; a total of 38% of the study population was aged 75 years or older. Of the mammograms, most were from women aged 65 to 74 years (64.6%) and non-Hispanic White individuals (81.4%). The 5-year cumulative incidence of invasive breast cancer increased in association with increasing breast density among women aged 65 to 74 years (almost entirely fatty breasts: 11.3 per 1000 women [95% CI, 10.4-12.5 per 1000 women]; scattered fibroglandular densities: 17.2 per 1000 women [95% CI, 16.1-17.9 per 1000 women]; extremely or heterogeneously dense breasts: 23.7 per 1000 women [95% CI, 22.4-25.3 per 1000 women]) and among those aged 75 years or older (fatty breasts: 13.5 per 1000 women [95% CI, 11.6-15.5]; scattered fibroglandular densities: 18.4 per 1000 women [95% CI, 17.0-19.5 per 1000 women]; extremely or heterogeneously dense breasts: 22.5 per 1000 women [95% CI, 20.2-24.2 per 1000 women]). Extreme or heterogeneous breast density was associated with increased risk of breast cancer compared with scattered fibroglandular breast density in both age categories (65-74 years: hazard ratio [HR], 1.39 [95% CI, 1.28-1.50]; \u226575 years: HR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.10-1.37]). Women with almost entirely fatty breasts had a decrease of approximately 30% (range, 27%-34%) in the risk of invasive breast cancer compared with women with scattered fibroglandular breast density (65-74 years: HR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.58-0.75]; \u226575 years: HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.62-0.86). Associations between breast density and breast cancer risk were not significantly modified by BMI (for age 65-74 years: likelihood ratio test, 2.67; df, 2; P\u2009=\u2009.26; for age \u226575 years, 2.06; df, 2; P\u2009=\u2009.36).The findings suggest that breast density is associated with increased risk of invasive breast cancer among women aged 65 years or older. Breast density and life expectancy should be considered together when discussing the potential benefits vs harms of continued screening mammography in this population.",
  "To compare the diagnostic performances of contrast-enhanced digital mammography (CEDM) and breast MRI in evaluations of breast cancer, with a focus on the impact of background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) levels.The present study included women who underwent CEDM and breast MRI to evaluate the disease extent of breast cancer between January 2018 and December 2019. Readers judged BPE levels (minimal-mild or moderate-marked) on CEDM, and were asked to assign findings suggesting malignancy using the following criteria: (1) enhancement other than BPE and (2) BI-RADS 4/5 calcifications without enhancement. On MRI, BI-RADS 3 and BI-RADS 4/5 lesions were evaluated as benign and malignant, respectively. The diagnostic performances of CEDM and MRI were compared separately between women with minimal-mild BPE and those with moderate-marked BPE.Sixty-nine patients comprising 43 postmenopausal and 26 premenopausal women were included in the present study. In total, 195 lesions (94 malignant and 101 benign) were identified. The sensitivity and specificity of CEDM for the diagnosis of all lesions were 90.8 and 91.5% with minimal-mild BPE and 79.3 and 76.2% with moderate-marked BPE, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of MRI were 90.0% and 71.0% with minimal-mild BPE and 87.5% and 78.1% with moderate-marked BPE, respectively. The accuracy of CEDM was significantly superior to that of MRI in women with minimal-mild BPE on both CEDM and MRI (p\u2009=\u20090.002). Regarding the negative impact of a correct diagnosis on CEDM, the odds ratio of \"moderate-marked BPE\" was 0.382.In patients with minimal-mild BPE, the diagnostic performance of CEDM was superior to that of MRI.",
  "BAP1 cancer syndrome is a rare and highly penetrant hereditary cancer predisposition. Uveal melanoma, mesothelioma, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and cutaneous melanoma are considered BAP1 cancer syndrome core cancers, whereas association with breast cancer has previously been suggested but not confirmed so far. In view of BAP1 immunomodulatory functions, BAP1 alterations could prove useful as possible biomarkers of response to immunotherapy in patients with BAP1-associated cancers. We present a case of a patient with BAP1 cancer syndrome who developed a metastatic breast cancer with loss of BAP1 demonstrated on immunohistochemistry. She carried a germline BAP1 likely pathogenic variant (c.898_899delAG p.(Arg300Glyfs*6)). In addition, tumor tissue sequencing identified a concurrent somatic variant in BAP1 (partial deletion of exon 12) and a low tumor mutational burden. As her triple negative tumor was shown to be PD-L1 positive, the patient was treated with combination of atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel. She had a complete and sustained response to immunotherapy even after discontinuation of nab-paclitaxel. This case strengthens the evidence for including breast cancer in the BAP1 cancer syndrome tumor spectrum with implications for future cancer prevention programs. It also indicates immune checkpoint inhibitors might prove to be an effective treatment for BAP1-deficient breast cancer.",
  "Mammography is the only screening method with evidence in support of reduced breast cancer mortality, but yields poor accuracy outcomes in women with dense breast tissue. The Japan Strategic Anti-cancer Randomized Trial (J-START) was conducted as part of the measures implemented to deal with women with dense breast tissue. Although the sensitivity was increased, the specificity was significantly lower in the intervention group because further examination was required in all positive cases classified by either mammography or ultrasound in the J-START. To address the issue, an overall assessment system of combined mammography and adjunctive ultrasound for breast cancer screening has been developed in Japan. The basic concept is based on a comprehensive assessment that includes a mammography assessment followed by an adjunctive assessment for ultrasound similar to the clinical setting. Currently, mammography alone is recommended for population-based breast cancer screening in Japan, but additional ultrasonography is extensively available for women, especially for women with dense breasts with shared decision-making for personalized breast cancer screening. The overall assessment system is recommended for use in Japan when breast cancer screening is conducted using both mammography and ultrasonography. In this article, we summarize the advantages of the overall assessment and the simultaneous mammography/ultrasound method, the basic approach used in Japan to assign the overall assessment category for breast cancer screening, and we outline the future directions of adjunctive screening ultrasound.",
  "<b>Background:</b> Breast cancer is the most common malignancy, and approximately 70% of breast cancers are estrogen receptor-\u03b1 (ER\u03b1) positive. The anti-estrogen tamoxifen is a highly effective and commonly used treatment for patients with ER+ breast cancer. However, 30% of breast cancer patients fail adjuvant tamoxifen therapy and most of metastatic breast cancer patients develop tamoxifen resistance. Although increasing evidence suggests that microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation influences tamoxifen sensitivity, the mechanism of the cross-talk between miRNA and ER\u03b1 signaling remains unclear. miR-575 has been reported to be involved in carcinogenesis and progression, however, the role of miR-575 in breast cancer remains limited. The aim of this study was to understand the mechanism of miR-575 in breast cancer tamoxifen resistance. <b>Method:</b> RT-qPCR was employed to assess miR-575 expression in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. The association of miR-575 expression with overall survival in patients with breast cancer was evaluated with KM plotter. Additionally, the effects of miR-575 on breast cancer proliferation and tamoxifen sensitivity were investigated both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Bioinformatic analyses and luciferase reporter assays were performed to validate CDKN1B and BRCA1 as direct targets of miR-31-5p. The ER\u03b1 binding sites in the miR-575 promoter region was validated with ChIP and luciferase assays. ER\u03b1 interactions with CDKN1B, cyclin D1 or BRCA1 were determined by IP analysis, and protein expression levels and localization were analyzed by western blotting and immunofluorescence, respectively. <b>Results:</b> miR-575 levels were higher in ER+ breast cancer than in ER- breast cancer and patients with high miR-575 expression had a significantly poorer outcome than those with low miR-575 expression. ER\u03b1 bound the miR-575 promoter to activate its transcription, and tamoxifen treatment downregulated miR-575 expression in ER+ breast cancer. Overexpression of miR-575 decreased tamoxifen sensitivity by targeting CDKN1B and BRCA1. CDKN1B and BRCA1 were both able to antagonize ER\u03b1 activity by inhibiting ER\u03b1 nuclear translocation and interaction with cyclin D1. Furthermore, miR-575 expression was found to be upregulated in ER+ breast cancer cell with acquired tamoxifen resistance, whereas depletion of miR-575 partially re-sensitized these cells to tamoxifen by regulation of CDKN1B. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our data reveal the ER\u03b1-miR-575-CDKN1B feedback loop in ER+ breast cancer, suggesting that miR-575 can be used as a prognostic biomarker in patients with ER+ breast cancer, as well as a predictor or a promising target for tamoxifen sensitivity.",
  "Data from a nationwide sample of US breast cancer survivors were used to examine associations between patient characteristics (breast cancer clinical features, prognostic factors, and treatments) and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Associations between postdiagnosis HRQOL and mortality were then evaluated.The authors identified female breast cancer survivors (n = 2453) from the Sister Study or Two Sister Study who were at least 1 year from breast cancer diagnosis and who had responded to a survivorship survey in 2012. HRQOL was assessed with the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global 10 measures. Multivariable linear regression was used to assess predictors associated with HRQOL. Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between HRQOL and all-cause mortality.HRQOL, assessed an average of 4.9 years after the cancer diagnosis (standard deviation of 1.9 years), was negatively associated with a higher cancer stage at diagnosis; a higher comorbidity score at the survey; experience of surgical complications; dissatisfaction with breast surgery; and experience of any recent recurrence, metastasis, or secondary malignancy. Since the completion of the survey, there were 85 deaths (3.5%) during a mean follow-up of 4 years (standard deviation of 0.5 years). In multivariate models, decreases in PROMIS physical T scores and mental T scores were associated with increased mortality (HR for physical T scores, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.05-1.11; HR for mental T scores, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06).Prognostic and cancer treatment-related factors affect HRQOL in breast cancer survivors and may inform targeted survivorship care. PROMIS global health measures may offer additional insights into patients' well-being and mortality risk.Findings from a study suggest that prognostic and cancer treatment-related factors affect health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in breast cancer survivors and that poor HRQOL may increase the mortality risk. The evaluation of HRQOL is important because it may hold potential as a tool for optimizing survivorship care.",
  "Approximately 30% of breast cancer patients develop endocrine resistance after tamoxifen therapy. There still lacks a comprehensive understanding on the mechanism of tamoxifen resistance. This study aims to explore the dynamic process of ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancer resistance to tamoxifen through the time course transcriptomic analysis.The transcriptome profiles of human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 treated with tamoxifen at different time scales were collected from LINCS, SRA and GEO databases. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the short-term tamoxifen treatment and tamoxifen-resistant cell lines. The time course analysis was used to explore the dynamic development of tamoxifen resistance using the transcriptome profiles of tamoxifen-cultured MCF-7 for 1-12\u00a0weeks.After the short-term treatment of MCF-7 with tamoxifen for 6\u00a0h or 24\u00a0h, the expression level of gene PRSS23 was significantly reduced. However, its expression recovered in the resistant cell lines. The time course analysis identified 9 clusters of the DEGs based on the temporal trend of their expression levels. Gene PRSS23 belongs to cluster 2 in which the expression levels were significantly down-regulated in the first 4\u00a0weeks but gradually recovered afterwards. Functional enrichment analysis of the DEGs in cluster 2 showed that they are significantly enriched in DNA replication, mismatch repair and cell cycle pathways. Their specific role in the resistance development needs to be further explored. The protein-protein interaction network analysis indicates that gene PRSS23 participates in the drug resistance by regulating multiple tamoxifen drug targets.The acquired drug resistance in ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancer is a complex and dynamic biological process. PRSS23 plays an important role in the development of resistance and is a potential target for overcoming resistance.",
  "The lncRNAs have been made certain to take part in the development of most cancers in multiple ways. Here, our purpose is to making observation of the biological role and function of lncRNA CDKN2B-AS1 in human breast cancer. Twenty-eight pairs of breast cancer tissue and adjacent normal tissue from breast cancer patients were used to investigate the expression of CDKN2B-AS1 by qRT-PCR. And a lentivirus-shRNA guided CDKN2B-AS1 were to reduce its expression. The function of CDKN2B-AS1 was analyzed using a series of <i>in vitro</i> assays. Meanwhile, the xenograft model was used to further explicate the role of CDKN2B-AS1 in breast cancer. As for the results, there is a relative rich expression of CDKN2B-AS1 in breast cancer tissues compared with the corresponding adjacent normal tissues. Compared with the human breast epithelial cell line, the abundant expression of CDKN2B-AS1 in breast cancer cells were revealed as well. Then, knockdown CDKN2B-AS1 inhibited the malignant biological behaviors of MCF7 and T47D cells. In mechanism, CDKN2B-AS1 sponged the miR-122-5p to regulate STK39 expression. Furthermore, the inhibition effect with sh-CDKN2B-AS1 on breast cancer cells was alleviated by miR-122-5p inhibitor. Last, an i<i>n vivo</i> model also confirmed that knockdown CDKN2B-AS1 retarded the growth of breast cancer. Our data concluded that knockdown of CDKN2B-AS1 suppresses the progression of breast cancer by miR-122-5p/STK39 axis.",
  "Previously, we reported that Wnt5a-positive breast cancer can be classified as estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer; its prognosis is worse than that of Wnt5a-negative breast cancer. This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the poor prognosis in Wnt5a-positive breast cancer patients.In total, 151 consecutive ER-positive breast cancer patients who underwent resection between January 2011 and February 2014 were enrolled. DNA microarray and pathway analyses were conducted using MCF-7 cells stably expressing Wnt5a [MCF-7/Wnt5a (+)]. Based on the outcomes, cell viability/drug sensitivity assays, and mutation analysis were performed using cell cultures and breast cancer tissues. The relationship between Wnt5a and the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway was also examined.The relapse-free survival rate in patients with Wnt5a-positive breast cancer was significantly lower than that in patients with Wnt5a-negative breast cancer (P\u2009=\u20090.047). DNA microarray data suggest that only the cytochrome P450 (CYP) pathway was significantly upregulated in MCF-7/Wnt5a (+) cells (P\u2009=\u20090.0440). Additionally, MCF-7/Wnt5a (+) cells displayed reduced sensitivity to the metabolic substrates of CYP, tamoxifen (P\u2009<\u20090.001), paclitaxel (P\u2009<\u20090.001), and cyclophosphamide (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Of note, PIK3CA mutations were not associated with the expression of Wnt5a in breast cancer tissue and culture cells.In ER-positive breast cancer, Wnt5a upregulates the CYP metabolic pathway and suppresses tamoxifen, paclitaxel, and cyclophosphamide resistance, all of the three, standard treatment methods for ER-positive breast cancer. Wnt5a is thus potentially involved in the poor prognosis of ER-positive breast cancer independently of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway.",
  "Black race is associated with worse outcome in patients with breast cancer. The distant relapse-free survival (DRFS) between Black and White women with localized breast cancer who participated in National Cancer Institute-sponsored clinical trial was evaluated.Pooled data were analyzed from 8 National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) trials including 9702 women with localized breast cancer treated with adjuvant chemotherapy (AC, n = 7485) or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC, n = 2217), who self-reported as Black (n = 1070) or White (n = 8632) race. The association between race and DRFS was analyzed using log-rank tests and multivariate Cox regression.After adjustment for covariates including age, tumor size, nodal status, body mass index and taxane use, and treatment (AC vs NAC), Black race was associated with an inferior DRFS in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+; hazard ratio [HR], 1.24; 95% CI, 1.05-1.46; P = .01), but not in ER- disease (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.83-1.14; P = .73), and significant interaction between race and ER status was observed (P = .03). There was no racial disparity in DRFS among patients with pathologic complete response (pCR) (log-rank P = .8). For patients without pCR, Black race was associated with worse DRFS in ER+ (HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.14-2.45; P = .01), but not in ER- disease (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.65-1.28; P = .59).Black race was associated with significantly inferior DRFS in ER+ localized breast cancer treated with AC or NAC, but not in ER- disease. In the NAC group, racial disparity was also observed in patients with residual ER+ breast cancer at surgery, but not in those who had pCR.Black women with breast cancer have worse outcomes compared with White women. We investigated if this held true in the context of clinical trials that provide controlled treatment setting. Black women with cancer expressing estrogen receptors (ERs) had worse outcome than White women. If breast cancers did not express ERs, there was no racial disparity in outcome. We also observed racial disparity in women who received chemotherapy before their cancer was removed, but only if they had cancer expressing ERs and residual disease on completion of treatment. If the cancer disappeared with presurgical chemotherapy, there was no racial disparity.",
  "The 8th edition American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) proposed a prognostic stage (PS), which included not only anatomical factors, but also biological factors. We aimed to investigate the clinicopathological significance of the PS and to compare PS and anatomical stage (AS) that has been established by the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC).Between 2002 and 2017, 800 patients were included in the study. Patients were classified using pathological UICC AS and pathological AJCC PS. The usefulness of PS in comparison with AS was validated using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Harrell concordance index (C-index).A total of 401 (50.1%) patients had pathological AS I, 324 (40.5%) had AS II, and 75 (9.4%) had AS III. Meanwhile, 535 (66.8%) had pathological PS I, 163 (20.4%) had PS II, and 102 (12.8%) had PS III. The number of AS II cases was 1.99-fold higher than that of PS II cases. For each stage, these survival curves were almost similar between AS and PS classification. Therefore, many patients to be classified into stage I and stage III were included in AS II group, while many patients to be classified into stage II were included in AS I group. To trichotomize the survival groups, PS appeared to be more specific than AS, and AIC and C-index confirmed the speculation.For the prognostication of primary breast cancer patients, AJCC PS appeared to be able to stratify the cases more appropriately than UICC AS.",
  "Since 1998, the Ontario Breast Screening Program (OBSP) has offered organized assessment through Breast Assessment Centres (BAC). This study compares survival between screened women diagnosed with breast cancer who have undergone assessment through a BAC and usual care (UC).A retrospective design identified two concurrent cohorts of women aged 50 to 69 within the OBSP diagnosed with screen-detected invasive breast cancer at a BAC (n\u202f=\u202f2010) and UC (n\u202f=\u202f1844) between 2002 and 2010 and followed until 2016. Demographic and assessment characteristics were obtained from the OBSP. Abstraction of medical charts provided prognostic and treatment data. Death data were assessed from the Registered Person's Database and the Ontario Registrar General All-Cause Mortality File. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models compared overall survival by assessment type (BAC/UC), stratified by stage.There were 505 deaths during the study (BAC\u202f=\u202f239; UC\u202f=\u202f266). Among women with stage I screen-detected breast cancer, those diagnosed through a BAC had 31% reduced risk of all-cause mortality (HR\u202f=\u202f0.69, 95% CI\u202f=\u202f0.53-0.90) compared to UC. Diagnosis within 7 weeks of an abnormal mammogram reduced the hazard of death from all causes by 34% among all women with stage I breast cancers (HR\u202f=\u202f0.66, 95% CI\u202f=\u202f0.47-0.91), and was more likely in BAC (79.7%) than UC (66.9%).The significant improvement in overall survival for women with stage I screen-detected invasive breast cancer assessed through BACs further supports the recommendation that women with abnormal mammograms should be managed through organized assessment.",
  "Triple-negative (TN) breast cancer represents one third of pregnancy-associated breast cancers (PABC). The aims of the current study were to describe oncological and obstetrical outcomes of patients with TN-PABC and to compare their prognosis with TN-non-PABC patients using a propensity score.Between January 2005 and December 2020, data of patients with histologically proven TN-PABC were collected and compared with data of TN-non-PABC patients under the age of 46 years diagnosed during the same period using a propensity score (PS).After PS matching (tumor size and lymph node involvement),there were 59 patients in each group. The median follow-up was 14 months (IQR 4.8-40.1) for the TN-PABC group and 60 months (IQR 30.7-101.4) for the TN-non-PABC group. Eight recurrences occurred in the TN-PABC group and 10 in the TN-non-PABC group (adjusted OR (AOR)\u00a0=\u00a00.60 (0.21-1.60), HR (Cox adjusted model- AHR)\u00a0=\u00a01.25 (0.53-2.94)). Two patients died in the TN-PABC group, and six in the TN-non-PABC group with an AOR\u00a0=\u00a00.23 (0.03-1.01) and an AHR\u00a0=\u00a00.58 (0.12-2.69). All the patients diagnosed during the second (n\u00a0=\u00a017) and third trimesters (n\u00a0=\u00a028) continued their pregnancies, with a median term at delivery of 38 WG (IQR 36-39). All patients gave birth to healthy newborns.Although the TN subtype is associated with poor prognosis in pregnant patients due to advanced stage at diagnosis and high lymph node involvement, our PS-matched case-control study showed that pregnancy per se does not worsen the prognosis in terms of recurrence-free and overall survival.",
  "In Taiwan, breast cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death in women. A nationwide screening program with biennial mammography for women aged 40-69 in Taiwan was implemented since July 2004, but the impact on breast cancer mortality has not been investigated.The interrupted time-series analysis was used to estimate the impact of mammographic screening on temporal trends of breast cancer mortality and to calculate the level of temporal changes due to the mammographic screening.The annual average percentage changes of the age-standardized breast cancer mortality rates for all women aged 40-69 were 1.06% from 1991 to 2004 (before mammographic screening) and 0.33-0.34% from 2005 to 2019 (after mammographic screening). For all women aged 40-69, the results of interrupted time-series analysis showed that the increasing trends of breast cancer mortality were all attenuated after the implementation of mammographic screening. An estimation of 2114 women prevented from death of breast cancer may be attributable to screening. For women aged 40-44, 55-59, 60-64 and 65-69, the percentage changes in mortality rates were - 12.1% (- 5.1 to - 19.6%), - 20.8% (- 16.5 to - 25.2%), - 12.8% (- 8.5 to - 17.3%) and - 13.0% (- 7.9 to - 18.3%), respectively, after screening. For women aged 45-49 and 50-54, the reduction of deaths and mortality rates of breast cancer were a little.This study revealed that the nationwide screening program with biennial mammography may be associated with the attenuation of breast cancer mortality trends in women aged 40-69 in Taiwan.",
  "We evaluated strategies to identify and recruit a racially/ethnically diverse cohort of women at high-risk for breast cancer to a randomized controlled trial (RCT). We enrolled 300 high-risk women and 50 healthcare providers to a RCT of standard educational materials alone or in combination with web-based decision support tools. We implemented five strategies to identify high-risk women: (i) recruitment among patients previously enrolled in a study evaluating breast cancer risk; (ii) automated breast cancer risk calculation using information extracted from the electronic health record (EHR); (iii) identification of women with atypical hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) using International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9/10 diagnostic codes; (iv) clinical encounters with enrolled healthcare providers; (v) recruitment flyers/online resources. Breast cancer risk was calculated using either the Gail or Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) models. We identified 6,229 high-risk women and contacted 3,459 (56%), of whom 17.2% were identified from prior study cohort, 37.5% through EHR risk information, 14.8% with atypical hyperplasia/LCIS, 29.0% by clinical encounters, and 1.5% through recruitment flyers. Women from the different recruitment sources varied by age and 5-year invasive breast cancer risk. Of 300 enrolled high-risk women, 44.7% came from clinical encounters and 27.3% from prior study cohort. Comparing enrolled with not-enrolled participants, there were significant differences in mean age (57.2 vs. 59.1 years), proportion of non-Whites (41.5% vs. 54.8%), and mean 5-year breast cancer risk (3.0% vs. 2.3%). We identified and successfully recruited diverse high-risk women from multiple sources. These strategies may be implemented in future breast cancer chemoprevention trials.We describe five strategies to identify and successfully recruit a large cohort of racially/ethnically diverse high-risk women from multiple sources to a randomized controlled trial evaluating interventions to increase chemoprevention uptake. Findings could inform recruitment efforts for future breast cancer prevention trials to increase recruitment yield of high-risk women.",
  "In the United States, Europe, and Asia, a consensus has been reached that there is a higher risk of breast cancer in high density breasts. However, there are some contrary reports that suggest the absence of an association between breast composition and breast cancer subtype; thus, there is conflicting evidence. The purpose of this study was to investigate trends in the incidence of breast cancer subtypes according to breast composition and analyze the survival rates in Japanese women.Between 2007 and 2008, 1258 Japanese patients with invasive breast cancer who underwent mammography and obtained a pathological diagnosis in our institution were included in the study. We compared cancer subtypes with breast composition types (dense and non-dense breast), and classified them based on initial mammography findings. Information on 5- and 10-year survival rates was collected by chart review for patients with dense and nondense breasts. Statistical analysis was performed using the Pearson's chi-square test for breast composition and cancer subtype. The effect of breast composition on mortality was examined using a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, and adjusted hazard ratios were calculated.No significant difference was found between breast cancer subtype and breast composition (P\u00a0=\u00a0.08). Five-year (log-rank test, P\u00a0=\u00a0.09) and 10-year (log-rank test, P\u00a0=\u00a0.31) survival rates were not significantly different between breast composition types.There was no significant association between breast composition and cancer subtypes. There was also no significant difference in the prognosis between patients with and without dense breasts.",
  "In older patients with breast cancer, the risk of dying from other causes than breast cancer strongly increases after the age of 70. The aim of this study was to assess contributions of breast cancer mortality versus other-cause mortality after locoregional or distant recurrence in a population-based cohort of older patients analysed by multi-state models.Surgically treated patients \u226570 years diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer in 2003-2009 were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. A novel multi-state model with locoregional and distant recurrence that incorporates relative survival was fitted. Other-cause and breast cancer mortality were indicated as population and excess mortality.Overall, 18,419 patients were included. Ten-year cumulative incidences of locoregional and distant recurrence were 2.8% (95%CI 2.6-3.1%) and 12.5% (95%CI 11.9-13.1%). Other-cause mortality increased from 23.9% (95%CI 23.7-24.2%) in patients 70-74 years to 73.8% (95%CI 72.2-75.4%) in those \u226580 years. Ten-year probabilities of locoregional or distant recurrence with subsequent breast cancer death were 0.4-1.3% and 10.2-14.6%, respectively. For patients with a distant recurrence in the first two years after diagnosis, breast cancer death probabilities were 95.3% (95%CI 94.2-96.4%), 93.1% (95%CI 91.6-94.6%), and 88.6% (95%CI 86.5-90.8%) in patients 70-74, 75-79, and \u226580 years.In older patients without recurrence, prognosis is driven by other-cause mortality. Although locoregional recurrence is a predictor for worse outcome, given its low incidence it contributes little to breast cancer mortality after diagnosis. For patients who develop a distant recurrence, breast cancer remains the dominant cause of death, even at old age.",
  "To analyse the role of repeated breast surgery (RBS) after breast conserving surgery (BCS) as a quality indicator in a consecutive series of breast cancer patients.Data from 1233 breast cancer patients submitted to BCS from 2015 to 2019 were reviewed. The influence of several variables on RBS rate (182/1232; 14.8%) was examined. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to look for significant associations with the risk of RBS.Surgical workload, BCS rate and clinicopathological variables were consistent over the study period, while RBS rate decreased after the introduction of shaving of cavity margins (from 17.9% to 9.5%). Tumor persistence at RBS was higher for mastectomy vs. re-excision (87.3% vs. 37.8%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.05), inconclusive vs. positive diagnostic biopsy (48.2% vs. 69.4%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), ductal carcinoma in situ vs. invasive carcinoma (69.0% vs. 51.3%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.046) and lower after neoadjuvant therapy (14.3% vs. 57.8%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.044). Several clinicopathological variables were associated with the risk of RBS, but only multifocality [Odds Ratio (OR): 1.8; p\u00a0=\u00a00.009], microcalcifications (OR: 2.0, p\u00a0=\u00a00.000), neoadjuvant therapy (OR: 0.4; p\u00a0=\u00a00.014), pathological intraoperative assessment (OR: 0.6; p\u00a0=\u00a00.010) and shaving of cavity margins (OR: 0.3; p\u00a0=\u00a00.000) retained independent value at multivariate analysis.RBS rate can be reduced by shaving of cavity margins. Current standards for RBS should not be made more stringent due to the existence of non-actionable risk factors. The value of RBS as a quality indicator should be scrutinzed.",
  "Combined endocrine therapy with a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor has been indicated to improve not only progression-free survival, but also overall survival in patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. However, resistance to this combination therapy inevitably develops. How to manage this resistant breast cancer is one of the most important clinical issues. To investigate the mechanisms of action responsible for resistance, we developed breast cancer cells resistant to CDK4/6 inhibitors, and analyzed their biological characteristics and sensitivity to different anticancer agents.HR-positive, HER2-negative MCF-7 and KPL-1 breast cancer cells were cultivated in palbociclib (PAL) or abemaciclib (ABE)-added culture medium for over 5\u00a0months, and we successfully developed PAL- or ABE-resistant cells. The effects of PAL or ABE on the cell growth, basal RB expression, RB phosphorylation, cell cycle and cell senescence were compared between resistant and parental cells. Effects of the other CDK4/6 inhibitor, different chemotherapeutic agents and estrogen on the cell growth were also examined. The expression levels of cyclin D1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, cyclin E1 and estrogen receptor (ER)-\u0251 were measured using RT-PCR.Long-term exposure to up to 200\u00a0nM PAL or ABE resulted in the development of PAL- or ABE-resistant MCF-7 or KPL-1 breast cancer cells. Basal expression levels of RB in both resistant cells were down-regulated. Inhibitory effects of either PAL or ABE on RB phosphorylation were reduced in both resistant cells. Accordingly, G1-S cell cycle retardation and cell senescence induced by either inhibitor were also attenuated in both resistant cells. Both resistant cells were cross-resistant to the other CDK4/6 inhibitor but almost as equally sensitive to different chemotherapeutic agents (5-fluorouracil, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, doxorubicin and eribulin) as the parental cells. The mRNA expression level of CDK6 significantly increased in the resistant MCF-7 cells and that of Rb1 significantly decreased in the resistant KPL-1 cells. Although both resistant cells were less sensitive to estrogen than the parental cells, the expression levels of ER-\u0251 did not significantly change in either.Our study suggests that acquired resistance to PAL or ABE confers cross-resistance to the other CDK4/6 inhibitor but not to chemotherapeutic agents in HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer cells. Down-regulation of basal RB expression and normalized RB phosphorylation reduced by CDK4/6 inhibitors may be responsible for the attenuated anti-cell growth effects of the inhibitors.",
  "Hormone Therapy (HT) reduces the risk of breast cancer recurrence and mortality in women with breast cancer. Despite these clinical benefits, rates of HT non-adherence and non-persistence are high. Research suggests this may be due to the impact of HT side effects. However, little research has explored the individual contribution of side effects to non-adherence and non-persistence behaviours, thereby hindering the implementation of targeted intervention strategies. Our aim is to review the published literature on breast cancer survivors' lived experiences of HT side effects and explore how these may be related to non-adherence and non-persistence behaviour.Electronic searches were conducted from inception to May 2020, utilising Cochrane CENTRAL, Medline, Embase, Web of Science and PsycINFO databases. Searches included a combination of terms related to breast cancer, adherence, hormone therapy and side effects.Sixteen eligible papers were identified, and study quality was high. Data were thematically synthesised into four analytical themes, which encompassed 13 descriptive sub-themes: 'Daily impact of side-effects', 'Role of Health Care Professionals', 'Managing HT side-effects', and 'Weighing up the pros and cons'.HT side effects significantly impact breast cancer survivor's quality of life. A lack of support from healthcare providers leads to self-management strategies, which negatively affects adherence and persistence behaviour.",
  "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a group of environmental pollutants associated with multiple cancers, including female breast cancer. Several xenobiotic metabolism genes (XMGs), including the CYP450 family, play an important role in activating and detoxifying PAHs, and variations in the activity of the enzymes they encode can impact this process. This study aims to examine the association between XMGs and breast cancer, and to assess whether these variants modify the effects of PAH exposure on breast cancer risk.In a case-control study in Vancouver, British Columbia, and Kingston, Ontario, 1037 breast cancer cases and 1046 controls had DNA extracted from blood or saliva and genotyped for 138 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and tagSNPs in 27 candidate XMGs. Occupational PAH exposure was assessed using a measurement-based job-exposure matrix.An association between genetic variants and breast cancer was observed among six XMGs, including increased risk among the minor allele carriers of AKR1C3 variant rs12387 (OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.42-5.19) and AKR1C4 variant rs381267 (OR 2.50, 95% CI 1.23-5.07). Heterogeneous effects of occupational PAH exposure were observed among carriers of AKR1C3/4 variants, as well as the PTGS2 variant rs5275.Our findings support an association between SNPs of XMGs and female breast cancer, including novel genetic variants that modify the toxicity of PAH exposure. These results highlight the interplay between genetic and environmental factors, which can be helpful in understanding the modifiable risks of breast cancer and its complex etiology.",
  "Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. South Africa has the largest global burden of HIV infection and the largest anti-retroviral treatment (ART) program. This study aimed to analyse the association of HIV and ART use with breast cancer clinico-pathological characteristics.Study participants were females, newly diagnosed from May 2015 through September 2017 with invasive breast cancer at two academic Surgical Breast Units in Johannesburg, South Africa at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital and Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital. We compared HIV-positive and HIV negative patients' demographic and clinical-pathological characteristics at the time of breast cancer diagnosis.Of 1050 patients enrolled, 1016 (96.8%) had known HIV status, with 226 (22.2%) being HIV positive. HIV positive patients were younger (median (IQR) age 45 (40-52) years), than HIV-negative patients (median (IQR) age 57 (46-67)) (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). HIV positive patients were more likely to be diagnosed with late stage breast cancer (p\u202f=\u202f0.01). However, HIV positive patients receiving ART at the time of breast cancer diagnosis were less likely to present with metastatic disease than those not on ART (p\u202f=\u202f0.05).HIV-positive patients present with breast cancer at a younger age and later stage disease than HIV-negative patients. Neither the duration of HIV infection nor ART use was associated with clinico-pathological characteristics of breast cancer.",
  "The number of breast cancer survivors increases, but information about long-term adverse health effects in breast cancer survivors is sparse. We aimed to get an overview of the health effects for which survivors visit their general practitioner up to 14 years after diagnosis.We retrieved data on 11,671 women diagnosed with breast cancer in 2000-2016 and 23,242 age and sex matched controls from the PSCCR-Breast Cancer, a database containing data about cancer diagnosis, treatment and primary healthcare. We built Cox regression models for 685 health effects, with time until the health effect as the outcome and survivor/control and cancer treatment as predictors. Models were built separately for four age groups (aged 18/44, 45/59, 60/74 and 75/89) and two follow-up periods (1/4 and 5/14 years after diagnosis).229 health effects occurred statistically significantly more often in survivors than in controls (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Health effects varied by age, time since diagnosis and treatment, but coughing, respiratory and urinary infections, fatigue, sleep problems, osteoporosis and lymphedema were statistically significantly increased in breast cancer survivors. Osteoporosis and chest symptoms were associated with hormone therapy; respiratory and skin infections with chemotherapy and lymphedema and skin infections with axillary dissection.Breast cancer survivors may experience numerous adverse health effects up to 14 years after diagnosis. Insight in individual risks may assist healthcare professionals in managing patient expectations and improve monitoring, detection and treatment of adverse health effects.",
  "Aging is a comorbidity of breast cancer suggesting that aging-associated transcriptome changes may promote breast cancer progression. However, the mechanism underlying the age effect on breast cancer remains poorly understood.We analyzed transcriptomics of the matched normal breast tissues from the 82 breast cancer patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset with linear regression for genes with age-associated expression that are not associated with menopause. We also analyzed differentially expressed genes between the paired tumor and non-tumor breast tissues in TCGA for the identification of age and breast cancer (ABC)-associated genes. A few of these genes were selected for further investigation of their malignancy-regulating activities with in vitro and in vivo assays.We identified 148 upregulated and 189 downregulated genes during aging. Overlapping of tumor-associated genes between normal and tumor tissues with age-dependent genes resulted in 14 upregulated and 24 downregulated genes that were both age and breast cancer associated. These genes are predictive in relapse-free survival, indicative of their potential tumor promoting or suppressive functions, respectively. Knockdown of two upregulated genes (DYNLT3 and P4HA3) or overexpression of the downregulated ALX4 significantly reduced breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, and clonogenicity. Moreover, knockdown of P4HA3 reduced growth and metastasis whereas overexpression of ALX4 inhibited the growth of xenografted breast cancer cells in mice.Our study suggests that transcriptome alterations during aging may contribute to breast tumorigenesis. DYNLT3, P4HA3, and ALX4 play significant roles in breast cancer progression.",
  "The outcome of patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is highly dependent on demographic factors and ethnicity. We aimed to evaluate the clinicopathological determinants of prognosis among women with TNBC using data from one of the largest breast cancer (BC) registries.A total of 6145 patients with BC from our referral center were evaluated from 1995 to 2018, among whom 523 had TNBC. The baseline, menstrual and reproductive, treatment and pathology related characteristics were evaluated.Among TNBC patients, the rate of stage 3 and 4 BC (29.9% vs. 14.4% and 7.8% vs. 0% for stage 3 and 4, respectively; <i>P</i><0.001), invasive ductal carcinoma (90.7% vs. 75.6%; <i>P</i>=0.004), nodal involvement (46.7% vs. 33.4%; <i>P</i>=0.026), mastectomy (57.3% vs. 37.8%; <i>P</i>=0.001) and axillary node dissection (76.7% vs. 59.8%; <i>P</i>=0.019) was significantly higher in the group that developed recurrence. Disease-free-survival was 80.6% (157.76 \u00b1 9.48 months) and overall-survival was 90.1% (182.73 \u00b1 3.28 months). For death, stage 3 BC (compared to stages 0 and 1 as base) showed a higher risk of earlier death (adjusted HR: 4.191, 95% CI=1.392-12.621; <i>P</i>=0.011). For recurrence, stage 3 BC (adjusted HR: 1.044, 95% CI=1.209-6.673; <i>P</i>=0.017) (compared to stages 0 and 1 as base) showed significantly higher risk for developing earlier recurrence. Moreover, those who had invasive ductal carcinoma (compared to other types of BCs) had a higher risk for developing earlier recurrence (adjusted HR: 3.307, 95% CI=1.191-0.724; <i>P</i>=0.012).BC stage plays a significant role in both earlier recurrence and earlier mortality among patients with TNBC.",
  "c-Myc is frequently upregulated in breast cancers, however, targeting c-Myc has proven to be a challenge. Targeting of downstream mediators of c-Myc, such as the 'cyclin-like' cell cycle regulator Spy1, may be a viable therapeutic option in a subset of breast cancer subtypes.Mouse mammary tumor cells isolated from MMTV-Myc mice and human breast cancer cell lines were used to manipulate Spy1 levels followed by tamoxifen or chemotherapeutic treatment with a variety of endpoints. Patient samples from TNBC patients were obtained and constructed into a TMA and stained for c-Myc and Spy1 protein levels.Over time, MMTV-Myc cells show a decreased response to tamoxifen treatment with increasing levels of Spy1 in the tamoxifen-resistant cells. shRNA against Spy1 re-establishes tamoxifen sensitivity. Spy1 was found to be highly elevated in human TNBC cell and patient samples, correlating to c-Myc protein levels. c-Myc was found to be stabilized by Spy1 and knocking down Spy1 in TNBC cells shows a significant increase in response to chemotherapy treatments.Understanding the interplay between protein expression level and response to treatment is a critical factor in developing novel treatment options for breast cancer patients. These data have shown a connection between Spy1 and c-Myc protein levels in more aggressive breast cancer cells and patient samples. Furthermore, targeting c-Myc has proven difficult, these data suggest targeting Spy1 even when c-Myc is elevated can confer an advantage to current chemotherapies.",
  "Breast cancer patients undergo extended treatments that affect their psychological state and quality of life. There is a lack of studies examining the effects of holistic stress management interventions (that combine stress perception, cognitive and lifestyle interventions) on mental health and biological indices (e.g. cortisol concentrations) of breast cancer patients.This pilot randomized controlled trial provided the first assessment of the effects of a novel, cognitive-based intervention, the Pythagorean Self-Awareness Intervention (PSAI), on psychological symptoms, quality of life, sleep quality and lifestyle as well as on stress-related biological measures of breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant therapy. Standardized questionnaires were administered at baseline and 8-weeksafter the intervention to evaluate quality of life, stress, depression, and anxiety (primary outcomes). Sleep quality, lifestyle and hair cortisol concentrations were also assessed (secondary outcomes).Forty-five breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant therapy were randomly assigned to the PSAI group (n\u00a0=\u00a025) or the control group (n\u00a0=\u00a020).Women in the PSAI group reported significant improvements post-intervention in total Quality of Life, specific aspects of Quality of Life [Physical well-being, Social well-being, Emotional well-being, Functional well-being, Breast cancer concerns] as well as Perceived stress, depression, anxiety and stress. Improvements in secondary outcomes included increase in sleep quality, empowerment for healthy lifestyle and reduction of hair cortisol concentrations.The PSAI was beneficial as complementary therapy in the women studied. Larger randomized controlled trials with longer follow-up are needed to ascertain these findings.",
  "Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) might be associated with host-cell mediated immunity, which could be partly reflected by peripheral blood cell counts. In addition, lymphocyte-predominant breast cancer (LPBC), which was defined as tumors having high TIL levels, showed a favorable prognosis among triple-negative breast cancer or HER2-positive breast cancer. We aimed to investigate whether peripheral blood cell counts are associated with LPBC.We evaluated the percentage of stromal TILs in breast cancer patients who underwent primary surgery, using the standardized methodology proposed by the international TIL Working Group. Lymphocyte-predominant breast cancer (LPBC) was defined as tumors having high TIL levels (\u226550%). Peripheral blood cell counts including absolute neutrophil counts (ANC), absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was obtained from pretreatment laboratory data.Of the 810 patients, 132 (16.3%) had LPBC, and 678 (83.7%) had non-LBPC. In a comparison of 3 markers of peripheral blood counts, LPBC had a significantly lower mean ANC than non-LPBC (3,304 vs. 3,564; P\u202f=\u202f0.023), but the other means were not different. In multivariable analysis, each 1K increment in ANC corresponded to an odds ratio of 0.790 (95% CI, 0.642 to 0.971) for LPBC. In the ER-negative and high-Ki67 subgroups identified by interaction tests, significant inverse correlations between continuous ANC and TILs were noted.Low peripheral ANC could be linked with LPBC, supporting the hypothesis that systemic immune cell counts might be associated with the tumor-immune microenvironment.",
  "We investigated the association between reproductive risk factors and breast cancer subtype in Black women. On the basis of the previous literature, we hypothesized that the relative prevalence of specific breast cancer subtypes might differ according to reproductive factors.We conducted a pooled analysis of 2,188 (591 premenopausal, 1,597 postmenopausal) Black women with a primary diagnosis of breast cancer from four studies in the southeastern United States. Breast cancers were classified by clinical subtype. Case-only polytomous logistic regression models were used to estimate ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for HER2<sup>+</sup> and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) status in relation to estrogen receptor-positive (ER<sup>+</sup>)/HER2<sup>-</sup> status (referent) for reproductive risk factors.Relative to women who had ER<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> tumors, women who were age 19-24 years at first birth (OR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.22-2.59) were more likely to have TNBC. Parous women were less likely to be diagnosed with HER2<sup>+</sup> breast cancer and more likely to be diagnosed with TNBC relative to ER<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> breast cancer. Postmenopausal parous women who breastfed were less likely to have TNBC [OR, 0.65 (95% CI, 0.43-0.99)].This large pooled study of Black women with breast cancer revealed etiologic heterogeneity among breast cancer subtypes.Black parous women who do not breastfeed are more likely to be diagnosed with TNBC, which has a worse prognosis, than with ER<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> breast cancer.",
  "Amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) gene is associated with worse prognosis and decreased overall survival in breast cancer patients. The HER2 gene contains several polymorphisms; two of the best-characterized HER2 polymorphisms are Ile655Val and Ala1170Pro. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between these two HER2 polymorphisms in normal breast and breast cancer tissues and known breast cancer prognostic factors in a retrospective cohort study of 73 women with non-metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. HER2 polymorphisms were assessed in breast cancer tissue and normal breast tissue using TaqMan assay. Ala1170Pro polymorphism in normal breast tissue was associated with age at diagnosis (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007), tumor size (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004) and lymphovascular invasion (p\u00a0=\u00a00.06). Similar significant associations in cancer tissues were observed. No association between the Ile655Val polymorphism and prognostic factors were observed. However, we found significant differences in the distribution of Ile655Val (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and Ala1170Pro (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) genotypes between normal breast and breast tumor tissues. This study demonstrates that only the Ala1170Pro polymorphism is associated with prognostic factors in HER2-positive breast cancer patients. Moreover, our results suggest that both HER2 polymorphisms could play a significant role in carcinogenesis in non-metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer women.",
  "Opioid binding protein/cell adhesion molecule-like (OPCML) has been demonstrated to be a tumor suppressor gene, as it has been shown in previous studies to play a tumor-suppressive role in a variety of cancers. However, the role of OPCML in breast tumorigenesis remains unclear.In this study, we analyzed OPCML expression in breast cancers and adjacent non-tumor tissue samples and examined its molecular function in the breast cancer-derived cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF7.We found that OPCML was downregulated in most breast cancer samples but that this protein was expressed in most adjacent non-tumor samples. The loss or downregulation of OPCML is associated with hypermethylation of its promoter. Methylation of the OPCML promoter was detected in all breast cancer cell lines and primary tumors but was not detected in surgical margin tissues and normal breast tissues. Furthermore, functional assays showed that ectopic OPCML expression could inhibit breast tumor cell proliferation in vivo and in vitro and further suppresses tumor cell migration and invasion.Our results show that OPCML exerts its tumor-suppressive functions in human breast cancer cells. Moreover, the promoter-specific hypermethylation of OPCML plays an important role in human breast cancer development.",
  "Occult breast cancer (OBC) is described as an axillary metastatic carcinoma without detection of a primary breast lesion and is uncommon. Significant advances in breast imaging have occurred since its description, decreasing its incidence. However current management is based upon old studies, with variable clinical, radiological and pathological definitions of OBC. We suggest standardised definitions of OBC to facilitate more homogenous data representation in the literature. This review also discusses the conflicting heterogeneous data and its influence in determining the current management guidelines. We discuss whether the current significant surgical recommendations are necessary and postulate whether they could be safely substituted with less invasive management.",
  "Early detection of cancer facilitates treatment and improves patient survival. We hypothesized that molecular biomarkers of cancer could be rationally predicted based on even partial knowledge of transcriptional regulation, functional pathways and gene co-expression networks. To test our data mining approach, we focused on breast cancer, as one of the best-studied models of this disease. We were particularly interested to check whether such a 'guilt by association' approach would lead to pan-cancer markers generally known in the field or whether molecular subtype-specific 'seed' markers will yield subtype-specific extended sets of breast cancer markers. The key challenge of this investigation was to utilize a small number of well-characterized, largely intracellular, breast cancer-related proteins to uncover similarly regulated and functionally related genes and proteins with the view to predicting a much-expanded range of disease markers, especially that of extracellular molecular markers, potentially suitable for the early non-invasive detection of the disease. We selected 23 previously characterized proteins specific to three major molecular subtypes of breast cancer and analyzed their established transcription factor networks, their known metabolic and functional pathways and the existing experimentally derived protein co-expression data. Having started with largely intracellular and transmembrane marker 'seeds' we predicted the existence of as many as 150 novel biomarker genes to be associated with the selected three major molecular sub-types of breast cancer all coding for extracellularly targeted or secreted proteins and therefore being potentially most suitable for molecular diagnosis of the disease. Of the 150 such predicted protein markers, 114 were predicted to be linked through the combination of regulatory networks to basal breast cancer, 48 to luminal and 7 to Her2-positive breast cancer. The reported approach to mining molecular markers is not limited to breast cancer and therefore offers a widely applicable strategy of biomarker mining.",
  "French breast cancer screening is based on organized screening with a mammography every two years for women between 50 and 74, and individualized screening for women at high or very high risk of breast cancer (personal history of breast cancer or atypical breast lesion or thoracic radiotherapy before the age of 25, high family risk without genetic mutation, genetic mutation). A novel approach of risk-based breast cancer screening is currently under evaluation in many countries, including France. This personalized screening, based on individual risk of having breast cancer in the next years, uses algorithms which combine clinical parameters, mammographic density, familial history and genomic (using polygenic risk score), to estimate breast cancer risk and adapt screening's frequency.",
  "Autofluorescence is an image enhancement technique used for the detection of cancer precursor lesions in pulmonary and gastrointestinal endoscopy. This study evaluated the feasibility of addition of autofluorescence to ductoscopy for the detection of intraductal breast cancer precursor lesions.An autofluorescence imaging system, producing real-time computed images combining fluorescence intensities, was coupled to a conventional white light ductoscopy system. Prior to surgery, ductoscopy with white light and autofluorescence was evaluated under general anaesthesia in women scheduled for therapeutic or prophylactic mastectomy. Endoscopic findings in both modes were compared, marked and correlated with histology of the surgical specimen.Four breast cancer patients and five high-risk women, with a median age of 47\u00a0years (range 23-62) were included. In autofluorescence mode, two intraductal lesions were seen in two breast cancer patients, which had an increase in the red-to-green fluorescence intensity compared with the surrounding tissue. One lesion had initially been missed by white light ductoscopy but was clearly visible in subsequent autofluorescence mode. One endoscopic finding was classified as suspicious by white light, but was negative in autofluorescence mode and showed normal histology.This study demonstrates for the first time the in vivo feasibility of autofluorescence ductoscopy to detect pathologically confirmed breast cancer precursor lesions in both breast cancer patients and high-risk women that were occult under white light.",
  "Cognitive impairment has a great negative impact on quality of life for breast cancer survivors. Emerging evidence suggested that physical exercise can improve cognitive function in order adults with Alzheimer's disease. However, less is known about the effects of physical exercise on cognitive function for breast cancer survivors. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of physical exercise on cognitive function in breast cancer survivors.EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science and PubMed were searched from the establishment of the databases to June 2021. Randomized controlled trials were included. All analysis were conducted using the Revman 5.3.12 studies (936 participants) indicated that exercise improved self-reported cognitive function (MD 10.12, 95% CI [5.49,14.76], p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), cognitive fatigue (MD -5.41, 95% CI [-10.31,-0.51], p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and executive function (MD -13.63, 95% CI [-21.86,-5.39], p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001).Physical exercise can improve cognitive function for breast cancer survivors, particularly in self-reported cognitive function, and executive function. Future studies need to explore the effect of exercise on cognitive function from the frequency and duration of exercise.",
  "The objective of this study was to describe the perspective of patients with early breast cancer toward research biopsies. The authors hypothesized that more patients at academic sites than at community-based sites would be willing to consider these procedures.In total, 198 patients with early stage breast cancer were recruited from 3 academic centers (n = 102) and from 1 community oncology practice (n = 96). The primary objective was to compare the proportion of patients willing to consider donating excess tissue biospecimens from surgery, from a clinically indicated breast biopsy, or from a research purposes-only biopsy (RPOB) between practice types.Most patients (93% at academic sites, 94% at the community oncology site) said they would consider donating excess tissue from surgery for research. One-half of patients from academic or community sites would consider donating tissue from a clinically indicated breast biopsy. On univariate analysis, significantly fewer patients from academic sites would consider an RPOB (22% at academic sites, 42% at the community site; P = .003); however, this difference was no longer significant on multivariate analysis (P = .96). Longer transportation times and unfavorable prior experiences were associated with less willingness to consider an RPOB on multivariate analysis. Significantly fewer patients from academic sites (14%) than from the community site (35%) would consider a research biopsy in a clinical trial (P = .04). Contributing to scientific knowledge, return of results, and a personal request by their physician were the strongest factors influencing patients' willingness to undergo research biopsies.The current results rejected the hypothesis that more patients with early breast cancer at academic sites would be willing to donate tissue biospecimens for research compared with those at community oncology sites. These findings identify modifiable factors to consider in biobanking studies and clinical trials.",
  "Although chemotherapy-induced congestive heart failure (CHF) is a well-known adverse event in cancer survivors, the long-term risk of standard low-dose anthracycline has not yet been reported. This study aimed to investigate the long-term effects of standard anthracycline on late CHF in breast cancer survivors.A nationwide retrospective cohort study was conducted using the national insurance claims data for nearly 98% of Korean citizens. Between Jan 2010 and Dec 2015, a total of 56,338 newly diagnosed female breast cancer survivors were included.The total number of person-years was 199,648 and the incidence rate of late CHF was 3.57 per 1000 person-years. In multivariate analysis according to the subject's age at diagnosis, only in the 50-59 age group, anthracycline-based [hazard ratio (HR) 1.765, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.206-2.583] and taxane plus anthracycline-based regimens (HR 1.816, 95% CI 1.192-2.768) significantly increased the risk of late CHF. In the 50-59 age group, standard low-dose anthracycline significantly increased the risk of late CHF (HR 1.627, 95% CI 1.080-2.451) in Cox proportional hazard regression models. In competing risk model with recurrence and in-hospital death as competing risks, standard low-dose anthracycline was a significant risk factor for late CHF [subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) 1.553, 95% CI 1.029-2.340].This nationwide study showed that standard chemotherapy with low-dose anthracycline is a risk factor for late-onset CHF in breast cancer survivors who were in their 50\u00a0s\u00a0at breast cancer diagnosis. Long-term monitoring of late CHF should be considered in these younger breast cancer survivors.",
  "We conducted a retrospective study to assess the follow-up of patients with localized breast cancer and the first indicators of advanced breast cancer recurrence. All patients with advanced breast cancer recurrence treated between January 2010 and June 2016 in our institution were registered. Among these patients, 303 patients initially treated for early breast cancer with curative intent were identified. After initial curative treatment, follow-up involved the oncologist, the general practitioner and the gynecologist in 68.0%, 48.9% and 19.1% of cases, respectively. The median DFI was 4 years for luminal A, 3.8 years for luminal B, 3.7 years for HER2-positive and 1.5 years for TNBC (p\u00a0=\u00a00.07). Breast cancer tumor marker was prescribed for 164 patients (54.1%). No difference in terms of follow-up was observed according to the molecular subtype. Symptoms were the primary indicator of relapse for 143 patients (47.2%). Breast cancer recurrence was discovered by CA 15.3 elevation in 57 patients (18.8%) and by CAE elevation in 3 patients (1%). The rate of relapse diagnosed by elevation of CA 15.3 or CAE was not statistically associated with the molecular subtype (p\u00a0=\u00a00.65). Luminal A cases showed a significantly higher rate of bone metastases (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0003). TNBC cases showed a significantly higher rate of local recurrence (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and a borderline statistical significant higher rate of lung/pleural metastases (p\u00a0=\u00a00.07). Follow-up recommendations could be adapted in clinical practice according to the molecular subtype. General practitioners should be more involved by the specialists in breast cancer follow-up.",
  "Breast density is strongly associated with breast cancer risk; however, studies on the association between density changes and breast cancer risk have controversial results. The aim of our study was to determine the association between breast density changes and breast cancer risk in East-Asian women. We included 3\u2009301\u2009279 women aged \u226540\u2009years screened for breast cancer twice during 2009 to 2010 and 2011 to 2012. Data were obtained from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) database. Breast density was evaluated using the Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS). Relative risk (RR) and 5-year risk of developing breast cancer according to density category changes were calculated. Overall, 23.0% of the women had a higher breast density and 22.2% of the women had a lower breast density in second screening compared to the first. An increase in the BI-RADS density category between two subsequent mammographic screenings was associated with an increase in breast cancer risk and vice versa in terms of RR. The 5-year breast cancer risk was affected by the initial BI-RADS density category, changes in density category and patients' characteristics such as age, menopausal status and family history of breast cancer. In patients with breast cancer family history, the 5-year breast cancer risk was prominent, at a maximum of 2.39% (95% CI = 1.23-3.55) in women with breast density category of 2 to 4. Changes in the BI-RADS density category were associated with breast cancer risk. Longitudinal measures of BI-RADS density may be helpful in identifying high-risk women, especially those with a breast cancer family history.",
  "Beta-2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) mediates proliferation and treatment resistance in preclinical models of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+) breast cancer. We evaluated ADRB2 gene expression as a prognostic and predictive biomarker in patients with HER2+ early breast cancer.ADRB2 expression was retrieved from HER2+ patients enrolled in the FinHer study (N\u00a0= 202), and 2 public datasets containing data from patients with HER2+ early breast cancer: one including patients who did not receive systemic treatment (disease-free survival [DFS] dataset; n\u00a0= 175) and another including patients who received neoadjuvant treatment (pathologic complete response [pCR] dataset; n\u00a0= 207). Survival was estimated with Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression was used for uni-multivariate analyses. ADRB2 expression was correlated with several gene signatures.ADRB2 high expression was associated with improved DFS rates in HER2+ patients (hazard ratio [HR] 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32-0.84; P\u00a0= .0068). No association between ADRB2 expression and pCR was observed (odds ratio 1.14; 95% CI, 0.63-2.10; P\u00a0= .67). No association between ADRB2 and relapse-free survival (RFS) was observed in HER2+ patients enrolled in the FinHer study (HR 0.93; 95% CI, 0.69-1.25; P\u00a0= .61). ADRB2 was associated with a low expression of angiogenesis-related (vascular endothelial growth factor\u00a0-0.38, P\u00a0< .001) and proliferation-related (aurora kinase A\u00a0-0.36, P\u00a0< .001; genomic grade index\u00a0-0.028, P\u00a0< .001; signal transducers and activators of transcription\u00a0-0.17, P\u00a0< .001) genes; and a high expression of immune-related genes (Perez\u00a0+0.45, P\u00a0< .001; STAT1\u00a0+0.28, P\u00a0< .001; immune response gene expression module\u00a0+0.29, P\u00a0< .001).Opposing our initial hypothesis, a high ADRB2 expression may be a favorable prognostic factor in patients with HER2+ early breast cancer. This association appears to be mediated by antiproliferative, antiangiogenic, and immunogenic effects of ADRB2.",
  "DNAJC10 (ERDJ5), a member of HSP40 family, was considered as an anti-oncogenic gene in neuroblastoma, prostate and colon cancers. But, the role and importance of DNAJC10 gene in breast cancer is currently unknown. In this study, in vitro/in vivo expression, biomarker potential and genetic/epigenetic alterations of DNAJC10 were analyzed in breast cancer.Real-time qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry methods were used to determine the expression level of DNAJC10 gene in breast cancer cell lines and clinical samples. The Kaplan-Meier plotter was used to evaluate the survival prognostic value of DNAJC10 mRNA expression in breast cancer patients. Mutation screening software and methylation-specific PCR were used to screen genetic alterations and methylation status of DNAJC10 promoter regions, respectively.DNAJC10 mRNA expression was significantly reduced in 3 out of 4 breast cancer cell lines compared to the nontumorigenic mammary epithelial cell line (MCF 10A). DNAJC10 protein expression was significantly less frequent in invasive ductal carcinoma samples (n\u2009=\u2009121) compared with adjacent normal breast tissues (n\u2009=\u200932) (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Downregulation of DNAJC10 mRNA was associated with poor overall survival (OS) (n\u2009=\u2009626) (p\u2009=\u20090.0096) and relapse-free survival (n\u2009=\u20091764) (p\u2009=\u20095.3e-12). According to the COSMIC and cBioPortal databases, point mutations and copy number variations of DNAJC10 were very rare in breast cancer samples. Besides, no genetic alterations on the experimentally validated promoter regions were found in breast cell lines. CpG island located in the promoter regions of DNAJC10 gene was found to be frequently hypomethylated in breast cell lines.In the light of previous knowledge regarding the role of DNAJC10 in carcinogenesis, findings of this study suggest that DNAJC10 is a potential diagnostic/prognostic biomarker and tumor suppressor candidate for breast cancer. Epigenetic factors other than promoter methylation could contribute to the downregulation of DNAJC10 expression.",
  "<i>Background and objectives</i>: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and its mortality is increasing. Therefore, research to improve treatment is of paramount importance. One method of treatment is photodynamic therapy. Photodynamic therapy selectively stimulates apoptosis in photosensitizer-treated neoplastic breast cells as a result of cytotoxic singlet oxygen generation via collisions between triplet excited state photosensitizer and triplet ground state oxygen upon tissue irradiation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of photodynamic action on cancerous breast tissue samples as a model of photodynamic therapy. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: Breast cancer tissue samples were obtained from post-operative material and the patterns of histopathological changes in breast cancer tissue before and after photodynamic action on post-chemotherapy tissue were evaluated. Excised tissue samples were obtained from 48 female breast cancer patients who had previously undergone chemotherapy. Breast cancer tissues for this study were taken from macroscopically visible tumors larger than 10 mm. Histopathological analysis was performed to evaluate any morphological changes prior to and after photodynamic action on the post-chemotherapy tissue samples. Eighteen breast cancer tissue samples were analyzed before chemotherapy, fifteen after chemotherapy, and fifteen samples were analyzed after chemotherapy and application of photodynamic action. The photosensitizer Rose Bengal was applied to the samples subjected to photodynamic action. <i>Results</i>: Photodynamic action on post-chemotherapy neoplastic tissue showed histological changes under a light microscope. The results showed that morphological changes in breast cancer tissues after chemotherapy and photodynamic action were dependent on the concentration of Rose Bengal. In all cases, follow-up imaging showed tumor shrinkage of an average of 35% from baseline size. <i>Conclusions</i>: Histopathological examination revealed photosensitizer-concentration-dependent changes after photodynamic action in excised post-chemotherapy tissue. The effects of photodynamic action observed in this study suggest that the application of photodynamic therapy after chemotherapy can aid in breast cancer cell eradication.",
  "Hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) is a transcription factor that facilitates the adaptation of cancer cells to hypoxic conditions and may be prognostic of breast cancer recurrence. We evaluated the association of HIF-1\u03b1 expression with breast cancer recurrence, and its association with timing of breast cancer recurrence.In this population-based case-control study, we included women diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer between 1985 and 2001, aged 35-69\u00a0years, registered in the Danish Breast Cancer Group. We identified 541 cases of breast cancer recurrence among women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive disease who were treated with tamoxifen for at least 1\u00a0year (ER+\u2009TAM+). We also enrolled 300 breast cancer recurrence cases among women with ER-negative disease, not treated with tamoxifen, who survived at least 1\u00a0year (ER-/TAM-). Controls were recurrence-free breast cancer patients at the time of case diagnosis, matched to recurrence cases on ER/TAM status, date of surgery, menopausal status, cancer stage, and county of residence. Expression of HIF-1\u03b1 was measured by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. We fitted logistic regression models to compute odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) associating HIF-1\u03b1 expression with recurrence, and with timing of recurrence.HIF-1\u03b1 expression was observed in 23% of cases and 20% of controls in the ER+/TAM+\u2009stratum, and in 47% of cases and 48% of controls in the ER-/TAM-\u2009stratum. We observed a near-null association between HIF-1\u03b1 expression in both ER/TAM groups (ER+/TAM+\u2009OR\u2009=\u20091.21, 95%CI 0.88, 1.67 and ER-/TAM-\u2009OR\u2009=\u20090.97, 95%CI 0.68, 1.39). HIF-1\u03b1 expression was not associated with time to recurrence among women in the ER+/TAM+\u2009stratum, but was associated with early recurrence among women in the ER-/TAM-\u2009stratum.In this study, HIF-1\u03b1 expression was not associated with breast cancer recurrence overall but may be associated with early recurrence among women diagnosed with ER-\u2009breast cancer.",
  "The aetiology of breast cancers diagnosed\u2009\u2264\u200950\u00a0years of age remains unclear. We aimed to compare reproductive risk factors between molecular subtypes of breast cancer, thereby suggesting possible aetiologic clues, using routinely collected cancer registry and maternity data in Scotland.We conducted a cross-sectional study of 4108 women aged\u2009\u2264\u200950\u00a0years with primary breast cancer diagnosed between 2009 and 2016 linked to maternity data. Molecular subtypes of breast cancer were defined using immunohistochemistry (IHC) tumour markers, oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), and tumour grade. Age-adjusted polytomous logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association of number of births, age at first birth and time since last birth with IHC-defined breast cancer subtypes. Luminal A-like was the reference compared to luminal B-like (HER2-), luminal B-like (HER2+), HER2-overexpressed and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).Mean (SD) for number of births, age at first birth and time since last birth was 1.4 (1.2) births, 27.2 (6.1) years and 11.0 (6.8) years, respectively. Luminal A-like was the most common subtype (40%), while HER2-overexpressed and TNBC represented 5% and 15% of cases, respectively. Larger numbers of births were recorded among women with HER2-overexpressed and TNBC compared with luminal A-like tumours (>\u20093 vs 0 births, OR 1.87, 95%CI 1.18-2.96; OR 1.44, 95%CI 1.07-1.94, respectively). Women with their most recent birth\u2009>\u200910\u00a0years compared to\u2009<\u20092\u00a0years were less likely to have TNBC tumours compared to luminal A-like (OR 0.63, 95%CI 0.41-0.97). We found limited evidence for differences by subtype with age at first birth.Number of births and time since last birth differed by molecular subtypes of breast cancer among women aged\u2009\u2264\u200950\u00a0years. Analyses using linked routine electronic medical records by molecularly defined tumour pathology data can be used to investigate the aetiology and prognosis of cancer.",
  "Particular breast cancer subtypes pose a clinical challenge due to limited targeted therapeutic options and/or poor responses to the existing targeted therapies. While cell lines provide useful pre-clinical models, patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and organoids (PDO) provide significant advantages, including maintenance of genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, 3D architecture and for PDX, tumor-stroma interactions. In this study, we applied an integrated multi-omic approach across panels of breast cancer PDXs and PDOs in order to identify candidate therapeutic targets, with a major focus on specific FGFRs.MS-based phosphoproteomics, RNAseq, WES and Western blotting were used to characterize aberrantly activated protein kinases and effects of specific FGFR inhibitors. PDX and PDO were treated with the selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors AZD4547 (FGFR1-3) and BLU9931 (FGFR4). FGFR4 expression in cancer tissue samples and PDOs was assessed by immunohistochemistry. METABRIC and TCGA datasets were interrogated to identify specific FGFR alterations and their association with breast cancer subtype and patient survival.Phosphoproteomic profiling across 18 triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) and 1 luminal B PDX revealed considerable heterogeneity in kinase activation, but 1/3 of PDX exhibited enhanced phosphorylation of FGFR1, FGFR2 or FGFR4. One TNBC PDX with high FGFR2 activation was exquisitely sensitive to AZD4547. Integrated 'omic analysis revealed a novel FGFR2-SKI fusion that comprised the majority of FGFR2 joined to the C-terminal region of SKI containing the coiled-coil domains. High FGFR4 phosphorylation characterized a luminal B PDX model and treatment with BLU9931 significantly decreased tumor growth. Phosphoproteomic and transcriptomic analyses confirmed on-target action of the two anti-FGFR drugs and also revealed novel effects on the spliceosome, metabolism and extracellular matrix (AZD4547) and RIG-I-like and NOD-like receptor signaling (BLU9931). Interrogation of public datasets revealed FGFR2 amplification, fusion or mutation in TNBC and other breast cancer subtypes, while FGFR4 overexpression and amplification occurred in all breast cancer subtypes and were associated with poor prognosis. Characterization of a PDO panel identified a luminal A PDO with high FGFR4 expression that was sensitive to BLU9931 treatment, further highlighting FGFR4 as a potential therapeutic target.This work highlights how patient-derived models of human breast cancer provide powerful platforms for therapeutic target identification and analysis of drug action, and also the potential of specific FGFRs, including FGFR4, as targets for precision treatment.",
  "Pregnancy associated breast cancer (PABC) is a rare entity and defined as breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy or one-year post-partum. There is sparse data especially from low and middle-income countries (LMIC) and merits exploration.The study (2013-2020) evaluated demographics, treatment patterns and outcomes of PABC.There were 104 patients, median age of 31 years; 43 (41%) had triple-negative disease, 31(29.8%) had hormone-receptor (HR) positive and HER2 negative, 14 (13.5%) had HER2-positive and HR negative and 16(15.4%) had triple positive disease. 101(97%) had IDC grade III tumors and 74% had delayed diagnosis. 72% presented with early stage (24, EBC) or locally advanced breast cancer (53, LABC) and received either neoadjuvant (n\u00a0=\u00a049) or adjuvant (n\u00a0=\u00a026) chemotherapy and surgery. Trastuzumab, tamoxifen, and radiotherapy were administered post-delivery. At a median follow up of 27 (IQR:19-35) months, the estimated 3-year event-free survival (EFS) for EBC and LABC was 82% (95% CI: 65.2-100) and 56% (95% CI: 42-75.6%) and for metastatic 24% (95% CI: 10.1%-58.5%) respectively. Of the 104 patients, 34 were diagnosed antepartum (AP) and 15 had termination, 2 had preterm and 16 had full-term deliveries(FTDs). Among postpartum cohort (n\u00a0=\u00a070), 2 had termination, 1 had preterm, 67 had FTDs. 83(including 17 from AP) children from both cohorts were experiencing normal milestones.Data from the first Indian PABC registry showed that the majority had delayed diagnosis and aggressive features(TNBC, higher grade). Treatment was feasible in majority and stage matched outcomes were comparable to non-PABCs.",
  "To investigate the prevalence of symptomatic dry eye (SDE) on women undergoing systemic adjuvant therapy for breast cancer and its association with treatment settings.Woman undergoing breast cancer systemic adjuvant therapy were included in exposure group. An age-matched non-treatment control group was recruited. This cross-sectional questionnaire-based study utilised validated Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and NCCN-FACT-Breast Cancer Symptom Index (NFBSI-16) questionnaires to determine the presence of SDE and investigate other breast cancer treatment complications. Additionally, demographic data and medical histories were collected.Of 423 eligible participants, 200 in each of the control group and the exposure group were included in the final analysis. The prevalence of SDE was 59.0% in breast cancer patients with adjuvant treatment, statistically significantly higher than 25.5% in the control group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Additionally, exposure group experienced higher prevalence of moderate and severe SDE, which were 20.0% and 19.5% respectively compared with 9.0% and 4.0% in the control group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.002, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). There was a significantly high prevalence of SDE among patients who had received over four cycles of systemic therapy (71.0%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and the application of targeted therapy (71.2%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.014). The severity of SDE positively correlated with the cycles of treatment administered.SDE was significantly predominant in women with breast cancer undergoing systemic adjuvant treatment. Our findings suggest dry eye assessments among patients receiving more than four cycles of chemotherapy or targeted therapy, thus early revealing possible dry eye conditions to both patients and clinicians for further specialized examination and treatment.",
  "The 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) pathological staging system for breast cancer considers biologic factors in addition to the anatomical features included in the previous systems. The purpose of this study was to determine the validity of the 8th AJCC staging system for T1-2N1 breast cancer and to assess the effect of additional chemotherapy and radiotherapy according to the new pathologic stages.The cohort included patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program (2010-2012) who had stage T1-2N1 invasive breast carcinoma and underwent mastectomy. All patients were restaged using the 8th AJCC staging system. The Kaplan-Meier method, Cox proportional hazards regression, and competing risks models were used for data analysis.We identified 9908 patients including 3022 (30.5%), 3131 (31.6%), 1940 (19.6%), 1194 (12.1%), and 621 (6.3%) were classified with stage IA, IB, IIA, IIB, and IIIA disease, respectively. The 5-year breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) was 97.3%, 94.3%, 88.3%, 84.0%, and 71.1% for stage IA, IB, IIA, IIB, and IIIA disease, respectively. Higher pathological stage was associated with a significantly higher risk of breast cancer-related death. Chemotherapy was associated with better BCSS regardless of the pathological stage, but radiotherapy was only associated with better BCSS in stage IIIA disease.The 8th AJCC pathological staging system provides more refined stratification for T1-2N1 breast cancer patients after mastectomy and may meet the needs of the current trend of individualized decision making for chemotherapy and radiotherapy in this patient subset.",
  "<b><i>Background:</i></b> The Gail, Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC), and Tyrer-Cuzick breast cancer risk prediction models are recommended for use in primary care. Calculating breast cancer risk is particularly important for women in their 40s when deciding on mammography, with some guidelines recommending screening for those with 5-year risk similar to women age 50 (\u22651.1%). Yet, little is known about risk estimate agreement among models for these women. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> Four hundred nine Boston-area women 40-49 years of age completed a risk questionnaire before a primary care visit to compute their breast cancer risk. The kappa statistic was used to examine when (1) Gail and BCSC agreed on 5-year risk \u22651.1%; (2) Gail estimated 5-year risk \u22651.7% and Tyrer-Cuzick estimated 10-year risk \u22655% (guideline thresholds for recommending prevention medications); and when (3) Gail and Tyrer-Cuzick agreed on lifetime risk \u226520% (threshold for breast MRI using Tyrer-Cuzick). <b><i>Results:</i></b> Participant mean age was 44.1 years, 56.7% were non-Hispanic white, and 7.8% had a first-degree relative with breast cancer. Of 266 with breast density information to estimate both Gail and BCSC, the models agreed on 5-year risk being \u22651.1% for 36 women, kappa\u2009=\u20090.34 (95% confidence interval: 0.23-0.45). Gail and Tyrer-Cuzick estimates led to agreement about prevention medications for 8 women, kappa 0.41 (0.20-0.61), and models agreed on lifetime risk \u226520% for 3 women, kappa 0.08 (-0.01 to 0.16). <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> There is weak agreement on breast cancer risk estimates generated by risk models recommended for primary care. Using different models may lead to different clinical recommendations for women in their 40s.",
  "Recent studies have shown better postoperative outcomes in mildly obese patients, a phenomenon called the obesity paradox. In the field of breast cancer surgery, however, previous studies have only shown an association between obesity and worse postoperative outcomes using multivariable analysis; the obesity paradox has not been investigated in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery.We identified patients who underwent mastectomy for stage 0 to III breast cancer from July 2010 to March 2017 using a Japanese nationwide inpatient database. We used restricted cubic spline analyses to investigate potential nonlinear associations between body mass index (BMI) and outcomes (postoperative complications, 30-day readmission, duration of anesthesia, length of hospital stay, and hospitalization costs). We also performed multivariable regression analyses for the outcomes.Among 239,108 eligible patients, 25.6% had a BMI of > 25.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. BMI showed U-shaped associations with postoperative complications, length of stay, and hospitalization costs, and a linear association with duration of anesthesia. The proportion of postoperative complications was lowest at a BMI of around 22.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, while the length of stay was shortest and total costs were lowest at a BMI of around 20.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Compared to a BMI of 22.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, a BMI of > 30.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> was significantly associated with greater postoperative complications, 30-day readmission, duration of anesthesia, length of stay, and hospitalization costs.Restricted cubic spline analyses displayed U-shaped associations between BMI and in-hospital complications, length of stay, and hospitalization costs, but none of the associations showed the obesity paradox.",
  "For patients with breast cancer undergoing breast-conserving surgery (BCS), adjuvant radiation (RT) and hormonal therapy (HT) reduce the risk of locoregional recurrence (LRR). Although several studies have evaluated adjuvant HT \u00b1 RT, the outcomes of HT versus RT monotherapy remain less clear. In this study, the risk of LRR is characterized among older patients with early-stage breast cancer following adjuvant RT alone, HT alone, neither, or both.This study included female patients from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (New York, New York) who were aged \u226565 years with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) T1N0 breast cancer treated with BCS. The primary endpoint was time to LRR evaluated by Cox regression analysis.There were 888 women evaluated with a median age of 71 years (range, 65-100 years) and median follow-up of 4.9 years (range, 0.0-9.5 years). There were 27 LRR events (3.0%). Five-year LRR was 11% for those receiving no adjuvant treatment, 3% for HT alone, 4% for RT alone, and 1% for HT and RT. LRR rates were significantly different between the groups (P < .001). Compared with neither HT nor RT, HT or RT monotherapy each yielded similar LRR reductions: HT alone (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.10-0.68; P = .006) and RT alone (HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.11-0.92; P = .034). Distant recurrence and breast cancer-specific survival rates did not significantly differ between groups.LRR risk following BCS is low among women aged \u226565 years with T1N0, ER+/HER2- breast cancer. Adjuvant RT and HT monotherapy each similarly reduce this risk; the combination yields a marginal improvement. Further study is needed to elucidate whether appropriate patients may feasibly receive adjuvant RT monotherapy versus the current standards of HT monotherapy or combined RT/HT.",
  "Cellular senescence (CS) is a major homeostatic biological process, which plays a key role in normal tissue development and provides protection from stressful cell insults. The role of CS in mammary-gland development and breast cancer is not well understood. While there is a lack of experimental data on the role of CS in the development of the pre-pubertal mammary gland, there is evidence for a biphasic senescence response in adult normal-mammary-epithelial cells, where the bypass of the first senescence barrier (M0) seems to be a key step in the development of premalignant lesions, with genetic abnormalities that resemble in situ breast carcinoma. Further, there is accumulating evidence for the role of cellular senescence in breast-cancer response, regarding treatment and patient outcome. Here, we review the current literature on cellular senescence, in epithelial-mammary cells, breast-cancer cells, and breast-tumor-microenvironment-resident cells. Furthermore, we discuss its putative role in breast-cancer response, regarding treatment and disease progression. In addition, we provide preliminary evidence of CS in breast-cancer-microenvironment cells, such as tumor-associated fibroblasts and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, by employing the novel GL13 lipofuscin stain, as a marker of cellular senescence.",
  "Adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) for breast cancer is associated with an increased risk of ischemic heart disease. We examined the risk of coronary artery stenosis in a\u00a0large cohort of women with breast cancer receiving adjuvant RT.A\u00a0cohort of women diagnosed with breast cancer between 1992 and 2012 in three Swedish health care regions (n\u202f=\u200957,066) were linked to the Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty Registry (SCAAR) to identify women receiving RT who subsequently underwent a\u00a0percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to coronary stenosis. Cox regression analyses were performed to examine risk of a\u00a0coronary intervention and competing risk analyses were performed to calculate cumulative incidence.A\u00a0total of 649 women with left-sided breast cancer and 494\u00a0women with right-sided breast cancer underwent a\u00a0PCI. Women who received left-sided RT had a\u00a0significantly higher risk of a\u00a0PCI in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) compared to women who received right-sided RT, hazard ratio (HR) 1.44 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21-1.77, p\u202f<\u20090.001). For the proximal, mid, and distal LAD, the HRs were 1.60 (95% CI 1.22-2.10), 1.38 (95% CI 1.07-1.78), and 2.43 (95% CI 1.33-4.41), respectively. The cumulative incidence of coronary events at 25\u00a0years from breast cancer diagnosis were 7.0% in women receiving left-sided RT and 4.4% in women receiving right-sided RT.Implementing and further developing techniques that lower cardiac doses is important in order to reduce the risk of long-term side effects of adjuvant RT for breast cancer.",
  "Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women worldwide. As survival rates increase, breast reconstruction and quality of life gain importance. Of all women undergoing breast reconstruction, approximately, 70% opt for silicone implants and 50% of those develop capsular contracture, the most prevalent long-term complication. The collagenase of the bacterium Clostridium histolyticum (CCH) showed promising results in the therapy of capsule contracture; however, its influence on residual cancer cells is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate whether CCH-treatment negatively impacts breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were used in this study. In vitro, we tested the influence of CCH on proliferation, wound healing, migration and cell cycle by MTT-assay, scratch-assay, transwell-migration-assay, and flow cytometry. In vivo, solid tumors were induced in immune-deficient mice. CCH was injected into the tumors and tumor growth and metastasis formation was monitored by caliper measurement, in vivo bioluminescence imaging and histology. Gene expression analysis was performed by microarray including 27,190 genes.CCH-incubation led to a dose-dependent reduction in proliferation for both cell lines, while wound healing was reduced only in MDA-MB-231 cells. No morphological alterations were monitored in cell cycle or apoptosis. In vivo, bioluminescence imaging and histology did not show any evidence of metastasis. Although CCH led to changes in gene expression of breast cancer cells, no relevant alterations in metastasis-related genes were monitored.CCH has no impact on tumor growth or metastasis formation in vitro and in vivo. This paves the way for first clinical trials.",
  "Breast cancer patients with bone metastases are usually managed with bone modifying agents, such as zoledronic acid and denosumab, and some bone turnover markers (BTMs) have been recognized as prognostic indicators in such patients. Although several studies have demonstrated the validity of BTMs as prognostic markers in patients treated with zoledronic acid, few studies have reported the utility of BTMs with denosumab treatment. In this study, we evaluated whether urinary N-telopeptide of type I collagen (u-NTX) can be a prognostic indicator in patients treated with denosumab.Thirty-six breast cancer patients newly diagnosed with bone metastases were evaluated retrospectively. Patients were treated with denosumab and anti-cancer drugs. u-NTX levels were measured 1\u00a0month before and after administration of denosumab, and the ratio of u-NTX levels before and after denosumab (change ratio) was assessed for its association with prognosis.Levels of u-NTX decreased after denosumab administration in all patients except for one. The median value of the u-NTX change ratio was 0.766. Based on the change ratio, patients were divided into either a \"high group\" (n\u2009=\u200918) or a \"low group\" (n\u2009=\u200918). The low group showed significantly shorter overall survival (OS) compared with the high group (low group 15.0\u00a0months; high group 54.0\u00a0months; P\u2009=\u20090.012). Multivariate analysis indicated that the \"low group\" was an independent prognostic factor for OS (P\u2009=\u20090.028).We demonstrated that the u-NTX change ratio in denosumab-treated breast cancer patients with bone metastases can be a prognostic marker.",
  "Heparanase (HPSE), an endoglycosidase that cleaves heparan sulfate, regulates a variety of biological processes that promote tumor progression. In this study, we analyzed the correlation between HPSE expression and prognosis in cancer patients, using multiple databases (Oncomine, TIMER, PrognoScan, GEPIA, Kaplan-Meier plotter, miner v4.1, DAVID). HPSE expression was significantly increased in bladder, breast, lung, and stomach cancer compared to matched normal tissues. The increased HPSE expression correlated with poor prognosis and increased immune infiltration levels of B cells, CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils and dendritic cells in bladder and breast cancer. In breast cancer, the high HPSE expression was associated with basal-like subtypes, younger age (0-40), advanced Scarff-Bloom-Richardson grade, Nottingham Prognostic Index and p53 mutation status. In addition, using a mouse model of breast cancer, our data showed that HPSE upregulated IL-10 expression and promoted macrophage M2 polarization and T cell exhaustion. Together, our data provide a novel immunological perspective on the mechanisms underlying breast cancer progression, and indicate that HPSE may serve as a biomarker for immune infiltration and prognosis in breast cancer.",
  "Epidemiological studies have indicated a higher prevalence of hypothyroidism in breast cancer patients, possibly related to shared risk factors and breast cancer treatments. However, few studies have evaluated how hypothyroidism impacts survival outcomes in breast cancer patients. We aimed to determine the association between hypothyroidism and breast cancer-specific and all-cause mortality.We conducted a population-based study using the Scottish Cancer Registry to identify women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2010 and 2017. A matched comparison cohort of breast cancer-free women was also identified. Using hospital diagnoses and dispensed prescriptions for levothyroxine, we identified hypothyroidism diagnosed before and after breast cancer diagnosis and determined associations with breast cancer-specific and all-cause mortality. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for potential confounders.A total of 33,500 breast cancer patients were identified, of which 3,802 had hypothyroidism before breast cancer diagnosis and 565 patients went on to develop hypothyroidism after. Breast cancer patients had higher rates of hypothyroidism compared with cancer-free controls (HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01-1.30). Among breast cancer patients, we found no association between hypothyroidism (diagnosed before or after) and cancer-specific mortality (before: HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88-1.12, after: HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.63-1.49). Similar associations were seen for all-cause mortality.In a large contemporary breast cancer cohort, there was little evidence that hypothyroidism, either at diagnosis or diagnosed after breast cancer, was associated with cancer-specific or all-cause mortality.",
  "Breast cancer therapies have made significant strides in improving survival for patients over the past decades. However, recurrence and drug resistance continue to challenge long-term recurrence-free and overall survival rates. Mounting evidence supports the cancer stem cell model in which the existence of a small population of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) within the tumor enables these cells to evade conventional therapies and repopulate the tumor, giving rise to more aggressive, recurrent tumors. Thus, successful breast cancer therapy would need to target these BCSCs, as well the tumor bulk cells. Since the Women's Health Initiative study reported an increased risk of breast cancer with the use of conventional hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women, many have turned their attention to phytoestrogens as a natural alternative. Phytoestrogens are plant compounds that share structural similarities with human estrogens and can bind to the estrogen receptors to alter the endocrine responses. Recent studies have found that phytoestrogens can also target BCSCs and have the potential to complement conventional therapy eradicating BCSCs. This review summarized the latest findings of different phytoestrogens and their effect on BCSCs, along with their mechanisms of action, including selective estrogen receptor binding and inhibition of molecular pathways used by BCSCs. The latest results of phytoestrogens in clinical trials are also discussed to further evaluate the use of phytoestrogen in the treatment and prevention of breast cancer.",
  "Women with unilateral breast cancer are at an increased risk for the development of contralateral breast cancers. We hypothesis that combined breast MRI would detect more contralateral synchronous breast cancer than conventional imaging alone, and resulted in less contralateral metachronous breast cancer during follow-up.We retrospectively collected two groups of breast cancer patients diagnosed from 2009 to 2013 for evaluating the effectiveness and value of adding pre-operative breast MRI to conventional breast images (mammography and sonography) for detection of contralateral synchronous breast cancer. The new metachronous contralateral breast cancer diagnosed during follow-up was prospectively evaluated and compared.Group A (n = 733) comprised patients who underwent conventional preoperative imaging and group B (n = 735) combined with MRI were enrolled and compared. Seventy (9.5%) of the group B patients were found to have contralateral lesions detected by breast MRI, and 65.7% of these lesions only visible with MRI. The positive predictive value of breast MRI detected contralateral lesions was 48.8%. With the addition of breast MRI to conventional imaging studies, more surgical excisions were performed in contralateral breasts (6% (44/735) versus 1.4% (10/733), P< 0.01), more synchronous contralateral breast cancer detected (2.9% (21/735) versus 1.1% (8/733), P = 0.02), and resulted in numerical less (2.2% (16/714) versus 3% (22/725), p = 0.3) metachronous contralateral breast cancer during a mean follow-up of 102 months.Our study provides useful estimates of the pre-operative breast MRI for the increased detection of contralateral synchronous breast cancer and less subsequent contralateral metachronous breast cancer.",
  "To clarify the characteristics, treatment trends, and long-term outcomes of patients with pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC).PABC includes breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy (PBC) and breast cancer diagnosed within 1\u00a0year after childbirth or during lactation (LBC). We compared clinical characteristics of 126 patients with LBC and 49 patients with PBC who underwent surgery at our hospital from 1946 to 2018. Survival was compared between patients with LBC and those with PBC in terms of breast cancer-specific disease-free survival (BC-DFS) and overall survival (OS).Patients with LBC were more likely to have family history, lymph node metastasis, lymphatic invasion, and to receive chemotherapy than patients with PBC. Patients with LBC showed poorer BS-DFS and OS than patients with PBC. Among patients with LBC, those treated after 2005 were older at surgery, had a smaller tumor size, received more systemic therapy, and had a more favorable prognosis than patients treated before 2004. Family history, breast cancer within 1\u00a0year after childbirth, and surgery before 2004 as well as cStage, lymph node metastasis, and lymphatic invasion were significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients with LBC. In the multivariate analysis for BC-DFS and OS among patients with PABC, LBC vs PBC did not remain as an independent prognostic factor while cStage remained.Patients with LBC had a poorer prognosis than those with PBC, most likely due to disease progression rather than biological characteristics. Early detection and optimization of systemic treatments are critical for improving the outcomes of patients with LBC.",
  "Long-term follow-up of Japanese women with breast cancer who underwent hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation (HF-WBI) has not been well documented. Therefore, we compared the treatment results of HF-WBI and conventional fractionated (CF)-WBI.Patients with stage 0-II breast cancer receiving partial mastectomy were eligible for this prospective observational study. The HF-WBI consisted of 43.2\u00a0Gy in 16 fractions to the whole breast, with an additional tumor-bed boost of 8.1\u00a0Gy in three fractions for patients with positive or less than 5\u00a0mm surgical margins. A total of 615 patients (400: HF-WBI and 215: CF-WBI) who were treated between 2006 and 2008 were investigated. Propensity score matching was conducted based on age, tumor grade, and margin status, and 372 matched cases were investigated for examining factors relating to intrabreast tumor recurrence (IBTR).With a median follow-up period of 9.4\u00a0years, age and margin status were independent factors associated with IBTR occurrence (P\u2009=\u20090.006 and 0.016, respectively). The 10-year ipsilateral breast tumor control (IBTC) rates after HF-WBI and CF-WBI were 96.5% and 95.3%, respectively (P\u2009=\u20090.606). The 10-year IBTC rates according to margin status were 88.0% with positive margins, 94.9% with 5\u00a0mm margins, and 98.0% with negative margins (P\u2009=\u20090.014).There was no difference in IBTC between CF-WBI and HF-WBI in our patients. Positive surgical margin was a risk factor independently associated with IBTC rates after CF-WBI and HF-WBI. Further investigation is required to establish adequate treatment strategies for patients with positive surgical margins.",
  "Breast cancer is one of the top causes of death, particularly among women, and it affects many women. Cancer can also be caused by various factors, including acquiring genetic alteration. Doctors use radiation to detect and treat breast cancer. As a result, breast cancer becomes radiation-resistant, necessitating a new strategy for its treatment. The approach discovered by the researchers is a flavonoid, which is being researched to see if it might help treat radiation-resistant breast cancer more safely than an approved medicine already being used in the field. As a result, this study focuses on the role of flavonoids in breast cancer suppression, breast cancer gene anomalies, and the resulting apoptotic mechanism.",
  "Estrogen is involved in both bone metabolism and breast cancer proliferation. However, evidence about the risk of breast cancer according to women's bone mineral density (BMD) is scarce, and little is known about their causal associations.Women participating in the UK Biobank cohort were used to investigate the association between BMD and the risk of breast cancer using Cox regression models. Instrumental variants associated with estimated BMD (eBMD) were extracted from genome-wide association studies with European ancestry. Logistic regression was used to calculate the genetic association with breast cancer in the UK Biobank and 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to assess their causal associations with breast cancer. Finally, the pleiotropic conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) method was conducted to further detect common genetic variants between BMD and breast cancer.Compared with the general population, postmenopausal women with BMD T scores <-2.5 had a lower risk of breast cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 0.77; 95% CI, 0.59-1.00), and this effect was stronger in women with fracture (HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.12-0.82). In MR analysis, no causal associations between eBMD and breast cancer were observed. The cFDR method identified 63 pleiotropic loci associated with both BMD and breast cancer, of which CCDC170, ESR1, and FTO might play crucial roles in their pleiotropy.An association between BMD and the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer in the UK Biobank was observed, whereas no evidence supported their causal association. Instead, their association could be explained by pleiotropic genetic variants leading to the pathology of osteoporosis and breast cancer.",
  "Oxidoreductase protein disulphide isomerases (PDI) are involved in the regulation of a variety of biological processes including the modulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, unfolded protein response (UPR), ER\u2011mitochondria communication and the balance between pro\u2011survival and pro\u2011death pathways. In the current study the role of the PDIA1 family member in breast carcinogenesis was investigated by measuring ROS generation, mitochondrial membrane disruption, ATP production and HLA\u2011G protein levels on the surface of the cellular membrane in the presence or absence of PDIA1. The results showed that this enzyme exerted pro\u2011apoptotic effects in estrogen receptor (ER\u03b1)\u2011positive breast cancer MCF\u20117 and pro\u2011survival in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA\u2011MB\u2011231 cells. ATP generation was upregulated in PDIA1\u2011silenced MCF\u20117 cells and downregulated in PDIA1\u2011silenced MDA\u2011MB\u2011231 cells in a manner dependent on the cellular redox status. Furthermore, MCF\u20117 and MDA\u2011MB\u2011231 cells in the presence of PDIA1 expressed higher surface levels of the non\u2011classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA\u2011G) under oxidative stress conditions. Evaluation of the METABRIC datasets showed that low PDIA1 and high HLA\u2011G mRNA expression levels correlated with longer survival in both ER\u03b1\u2011positive and ER\u03b1\u2011negative stage\u00a02 breast cancer patients. In addition, analysis of the PDIA1 vs.\u00a0the HLA\u2011G mRNA ratio in the subgroup of the living stage 2 breast cancer patients exhibiting low PDIA1 and high HLA\u2011G mRNA levels revealed that the longer the survival time of the ratio was high PDIA1 and low HLA\u2011G mRNA and occurred predominantly in ER\u03b1\u2011positive breast cancer patients whereas in the same subgroup of the ER\u03b1\u2011negative breast cancer mainly this ratio was low PDIA1 and high HLA\u2011G mRNA. Taken together these results provide evidence supporting the view that PDIA1 is linked to several hallmarks of breast cancer pathways including the process of antigen processing and presentation and tumor immunorecognition.",
  "Women diagnosed with breast cancer during working age are at increased risk of permanent absence from work, but the underlying medical causes have rarely been studied. We examined the risk of cause-specific sick leave, disability pension, and the competing event death after a breast cancer diagnosis in a population-based cohort study.From the Breast Cancer Data Base Sweden, we identified 16,603 women diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer between 2000 and 2012, and 63,773 control women. Using multi-state modelling, we calculated probabilities and durations of sick leave, disability pension, and death by registered cause, together with cause-specific hazard ratios.Five years after diagnosis, causes other than cancer accounted for around half of all sick leave (3.5% out of 6.8% of women) and disability pension (1.4% out of 2.6%) in women with breast cancer. Compared with control women, women with breast cancer were at increased risk of sick leave and disability pension due to mental disorders (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.15-1.33 and HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.29-1.85, respectively) and disability pension due to inflammatory diseases (HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.05-2.03). The risk of sick leave and disability pension due to cardiovascular disease was also elevated, although only statistically significant for disability pension in women diagnosed after 2005 (HR 2.24, 95% CI 1.22-4.13).Follow-up, support, and rehabilitation programs for women diagnosed with breast cancer must address a wide range of psychological and physical conditions to limit the consequences on working life.",
  "Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network and American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines recommend against screening breast cancer patients for asymptomatic brain metastases. Because brain metastases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality from breast cancer, we undertook a literature review to ascertain whether there might be a role for brain metastases screening in high-risk patient subgroups.A literature search was conducted on the OvidSP platform in the MedLine database, using MeSH terms and subject headings related to breast cancer, brain metastases, and incidence. The search was conducted without language or publication restrictions, and included articles indexed from January 1, 2006 to June 10, 2018. Experimental and observational studies that reported the incidence of brain metastases in patients with nonmetastatic or metastatic breast cancer were included.One hundred seventy studies were identified, with 33 included in the final analysis. Among nonmetastatic breast cancer patients, incidence of brain metastases as site of first recurrence per year of median follow-up ranged from 0.1% to 3.2%. Although incidence of brain metastases was much higher among the metastatic breast cancer population overall, it was particularly high among metastatic HER2-overexpressing (HER2<sup>+</sup>) and triple-negative populations, ranging between 22% and 36% for the former, and 15%-37% for the latter in the absence of screening.In patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer, screening for asymptomatic brain metastases cannot currently be justified. However, due to the high incidence of brain metastases among patients with metastatic HER2<sup>+</sup> and triple-negative breast cancer, studies to determine the value of screening for brain metastases should be undertaken in these subgroups.",
  "In the scope of the European Commission Initiative on Breast Cancer (ECIBC) the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) subgroup was tasked to identify breast cancer screening programme (BCSP) performance indicators, including their acceptable and desirable levels, which are associated with breast cancer (BC) mortality. This paper documents the methodology used for the indicator selection.The indicators were identified through a multi-stage process. First, a scoping review was conducted to identify existing performance indicators. Second, building on existing frameworks for making well-informed health care choices, a specific conceptual framework was developed to guide the indicator selection. Third, two group exercises including a rating and ranking survey were conducted for indicator selection using pre-determined criteria, such as: relevance, measurability, accurateness, ethics and understandability. The selected indicators were mapped onto a BC screening pathway developed by the M&E subgroup to illustrate the steps of BC screening common to all EU countries.A total of 96 indicators were identified from an initial list of 1325 indicators. After removing redundant and irrelevant indicators and adding those missing, 39 candidate indicators underwent the rating and ranking exercise. Based on the results, the M&E subgroup selected 13 indicators: screening coverage, participation rate, recall rate, breast cancer detection rate, invasive breast cancer detection rate, cancers >\u200920\u2009mm, cancers \u226410\u2009mm, lymph node status, interval cancer rate, episode sensitivity, time interval between screening and first treatment, benign open surgical biopsy rate, and mastectomy rate.This systematic approach led to the identification of 13 BCSP candidate performance indicators to be further evaluated for their association with BC mortality.",
  "Although it is uncommon in general, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer during pregnancy. While treatment for pregnant patients should adhere to treatment guidelines for non-pregnant patients, there exist specific considerations concerning diagnosis, staging, oncological treatment, and obstetrical care. Imaging and staging are preferably performed using breast ultrasound and mammography. Other ionizing radiation imaging modalities, including computed tomography (CT) and Positron Emission Tomography/ Computed Tomography (PET/CT), can be selectively performed when the estimated benefit for the mother outweighs the risks to the foetus, e.g., when the results will change clinical management. MRI is appropriate to stage for distant disease on the indication. Breast cancer during pregnancy is less often hormone receptor-positive and more frequently triple-negative breast cancer compared to age-matched controls. The basic principle is that women should receive state-of-the-art oncological treatment without delay if possible and that the pregnancy should be maintained as long as possible. Treatment strategy should be multidisciplinary defined, carefully weighing the selection, sequence, and timing of treatment modalities depending on patient-, tumour-, and pregnancy-related characteristics, as well as patient preferences. Initiating cancer treatment during pregnancy often decreases the risks of early delivery and prematurity. Breast cancer surgery is possible during all trimesters. Radiotherapy is possible during pregnancy in the first half of pregnancy. Chemotherapy can be safely administered starting from 12 weeks of gestational age, but endocrine and HER2 targeted therapy are contraindicated throughout the whole pregnancy. Importantly, foetal growth should be monitored and long-term follow-up of the children is encouraged in dedicated centres.",
  "Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy among women. However, the role of microRNA (miRNA) expression in breast cancer progression is not fully understood. In this study we examined predictive interactions between differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs in breast cancer cell lines representative of the common molecular subtypes. Integrative bioinformatics analysis identified miR-193 and miR-210 as potential regulatory biomarkers of mRNA in breast cancer. Several recent studies have investigated these miRNAs in a broad range of tumors, but the mechanism of their involvement in cancer progression has not previously been investigated.The miRNA-mRNA interactions in breast cancer cell lines were identified by parallel expression analysis and miRNA target prediction programs. The expression profiles of mRNA and miRNAs from luminal (MCF-7, MCF-7/AZ and T47D), HER2 (BT20 and SK-BR3) and triple negative subtypes (Hs578T e MDA-MB-231) could be clearly separated by unsupervised analysis using HB4A cell line as a control. Breast cancer miRNA data from TCGA patients were grouped according to molecular subtypes and then used to validate these findings. Expression of miR-193 and miR-210 was investigated by miRNA transient silencing assays using the MCF7, BT20 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. Functional studies included, xCELLigence system, ApoTox-Glo triplex assay, flow cytometry and transwell inserts were performed to determine cell proliferation, cytotoxicity, apoptosis, migration and invasion, respectively.The most evident effects were associated with cell proliferation after miR-210 silencing in triple negative subtype cell line MDA-MB-231. Using in silico prediction algorithms, TNFRSF10 was identified as one of the potential regulated downstream targets for both miRNAs. The TNFRSF10C and TNFRSF10D mRNA expression inversely correlated with the expression levels of miR-193 and miR210 in breast cell lines and breast cancer patients, respectively. Other potential regulated genes whose expression also inversely correlated with both miRNAs were CCND1, a known mediator on invasion and metastasis, and the tumor suppressor gene RUNX3.In summary, our findings identify miR-193 and miR-210 as potential regulatory miRNA in different molecular subtypes of breast cancer and suggest that miR-210 may have a specific role in MDA-MB-231 proliferation. Our results highlight important new downstream regulated targets that may serve as promising therapeutic pathways for aggressive breast cancers.",
  "The IBIS/Tyrer-Cuzick model is used clinically to guide breast cancer screening and prevention, but was developed primarily in non-Hispanic White women. Little is known about its long-term performance in a racially/ethnically diverse population.The Women's Health Initiative study enrolled postmenopausal women from 1993-1998. Women were included who were aged <80 years at enrollment with no prior breast cancer or mastectomy and with data required for IBIS/Tyrer-Cuzick calculation (weight; height; ages at menarche, first birth, and menopause; menopausal hormone therapy use; and family history of breast or ovarian cancer). Calibration was assessed by the ratio of observed breast cancer cases to the number expected by the IBIS/Tyrer-Cuzick model (O/E; calculated as the sum of cumulative hazards). Differential discrimination was tested for by self-reported race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, Asian or Pacific Islander, and American Indian or Alaskan Native) using Cox regression. Exploratory analyses, including simulation of a protective single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs140068132 at 6q25, were performed.During follow-up (median 18.9 years, maximum 23.4 years), 6783 breast cancer cases occurred among 90,967 women. IBIS/Tyrer-Cuzick was well calibrated overall (O/E ratio = 0.95; 95% CI, 0.93-0.97) and in most racial/ethnic groups, but overestimated risk for Hispanic women (O/E ratio = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62-0.90). Discrimination did not differ by race/ethnicity. Exploratory simulation of the protective SNP suggested improved IBIS/Tyrer-Cuzick calibration for Hispanic women (O/E ratio = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.66-0.96).The IBIS/Tyrer-Cuzick model is well calibrated for several racial/ethnic groups over 2 decades of follow-up. Studies that incorporate genetic and other risk factors, particularly among Hispanic women, are essential to improve breast cancer-risk prediction.",
  "Black women have a 40% increased risk of breast cancer-related mortality. These outcome disparities may reflect differences in tumor pathways and a lack of targetable therapies for specific subtypes that are more common in Black women. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a targetable pathway that promotes breast cancer tumorigenesis, is associated with basal-like breast cancer, and is differentially expressed by race. This study assessed whether a 38-gene HGF expression signature is associated with recurrence and survival in Black and non-Black women.Study participants included 1957 invasive breast cancer cases from the Carolina Breast Cancer Study. The HGF signature was evaluated in association with recurrence (n\u2009=\u20091251, 171 recurrences), overall, and breast cancer-specific mortality (n\u2009=\u2009706, 190/328 breast cancer/overall deaths) using Cox proportional hazard models.Women with HGF-positive tumors had higher recurrence rates [HR 1.88, 95% CI (1.19, 2.98)], breast cancer-specific mortality [HR 1.90, 95% CI (1.26, 2.85)], and overall mortality [HR 1.69; 95% CI (1.17, 2.43)]. Among Black women, HGF positivity was significantly associated with higher 5-year rate of recurrence [HR 1.73; 95% CI (1.01, 2.99)], but this association was not significant in non-Black women [HR 1.68; 95% CI (0.72, 3.90)]. Among Black women, HGF-positive tumors had elevated breast cancer-specific mortality [HR 1.80, 95% CI (1.05, 3.09)], which was not significant in non-Black women [HR 1.52; 95% CI (0.78, 2.99)].This multi-gene HGF signature is a poor-prognosis feature for breast cancer and may identify patients who could benefit from HGF-targeted treatments, an unmet need for Black and triple-negative patients.",
  "Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of death among women. KRAS is known as an oncogene, its expression also associates with cancer prognosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of KRAS expression in breast cancer and its relationship with immune infiltration.Firstly, the expression level and methylation of KRAS were analyzed. Then survival analysis was used to verify the prognostic capability of KRAS expression. After that, gene functional enrichment analysis was performed. The relationship between KRAS gene expression and immune infiltration was researched later.The expression level of KRAS in breast cancer was increased (P\u2009=\u20092.2e-16). Tumor KRAS expression in the subtypes of basal-like, HER2-enriched, Luminal A and Luminal B were 1.64, 1.67, 1.51 and 1.42 times of normal, respectively. 13 methylation sites were different between tumor and normal tissues and associated with KRAS expression. Subsequently, Kaplan-Meier analysis suggested that the high KRAS expression group had a poor prognosis (P\u2009=\u20090.0028). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, KRAS expression was an independent prognostic indicator (HR\u2009=\u20091.353, 95% CI 1.009-1.814, P\u2009=\u20090.044). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed enrichment of epidermal growth associated pathways. Additionally, different KRAS expression levels represented different tumor immune infiltration status, which may be caused by the influence of the RAS/MAPK and RAS/PI3K pathways on the level of PD-L1.This study suggests that KRAS expression can be used as a prognostic indicator of breast cancer, and it is closely related to tumor immune infiltration.",
  "Breast cancer heterogeneity is an essential element that plays a role in the therapy response variability and the patient's outcome. This highlights the need for more precise subtyping methods that focus not only on tumor cells but also investigate the profile of stromal cells as well as immune cells.To mine publicly available transcriptomic breast cancer datasets and reanalyze their transcriptomic profiling using unsupervised clustering in order to identify novel subsets in molecular subtypes of breast cancer, then explore the stromal and immune cells profile in each subset using bioinformatics and systems immunology approaches.Transcriptomic data from 1,084 breast cancer patients obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were extracted and subjected to unsupervised clustering using a recently described, multi-step algorithm called Iterative Clustering and Guide-gene Selection (ICGS). For each cluster, the stromal and immune profile was investigated using ESTIMATE and CIBERSORT analytical tool. Clinical outcomes and differentially expressed genes of the characterized clusters were identified and validated <i>in silico</i> and <i>in vitro</i> in a cohort of 80 breast cancer samples by immunohistochemistry.Seven unique sub-clusters showed distinct molecular and clinical profiles between the well-known breast cancer subtypes. Those unsupervised clusters identified more homogenous subgroups in each of the classical subtypes with a different prognostic profile. Immune profiling of the identified clusters showed that while the classically activated macrophages (M1) are correlated with the more aggressive basal-like breast cancer subtype, the alternatively activated macrophages (M2) showed a higher level of infiltration in luminal A and luminal B subtypes. Indeed, patients with higher levels of M1 expression showed less advanced disease and better patient outcomes presented as prolonged overall survival. Moreover, the M1 high basal-like breast cancer group showed a higher expression of interferon-gamma induced chemokines and guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) involved in immunity against microbes.Adding immune profiling using transcriptomic data can add precision for diagnosis and prognosis and can cluster patients according to the available modalities of therapy in a more personalized approach.",
  "Given the high heterogeneity among breast tumors, associations between common germline genetic variants and survival that may exist within specific subgroups could go undetected in an unstratified set of breast cancer patients.We performed genome-wide association analyses within 15 subgroups of breast cancer patients based on prognostic factors, including hormone receptors, tumor grade, age, and type of systemic treatment. Analyses were based on 91,686 female patients of European ancestry from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium, including 7531 breast cancer-specific deaths over a median follow-up of 8.1\u2009years. Cox regression was used to assess associations of common germline variants with 15-year and 5-year breast cancer-specific survival. We assessed the probability of these associations being true positives via the Bayesian false discovery probability (BFDP <\u20090.15).Evidence of associations with breast cancer-specific survival was observed in three patient subgroups, with variant rs5934618 in patients with grade 3 tumors (15-year-hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] 1.32 [1.20, 1.45], P = 1.4E-08, BFDP = 0.01, per G allele); variant rs4679741 in patients with ER-positive tumors treated with endocrine therapy (15-year-HR [95% CI] 1.18 [1.11, 1.26], P = 1.6E-07, BFDP = 0.09, per G allele); variants rs1106333 (15-year-HR [95% CI] 1.68 [1.39,2.03], P = 5.6E-08, BFDP = 0.12, per A allele) and rs78754389 (5-year-HR [95% CI] 1.79 [1.46,2.20], P = 1.7E-08, BFDP = 0.07, per A allele), in patients with ER-negative tumors treated with chemotherapy.We found evidence of four loci associated with breast cancer-specific survival within three patient subgroups. There was limited evidence for the existence of associations in other patient subgroups. However, the power for many subgroups is limited due to the low number of events. Even so, our results suggest that the impact of common germline genetic variants on breast cancer-specific survival might be limited.",
  "Among women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer, 30% have a prior diagnosis of benign breast disease (BBD). Thus, it is important to identify factors among BBD patients that elevate invasive cancer risk. In the general population, risk factors differ in their associations by clinical pathologic features; however, whether women with BBD show etiologic heterogeneity in the types of breast cancers they develop remains unknown.Using a nested case-control study of BBD and breast cancer risk conducted in a community healthcare plan (Kaiser Permanente Northwest), we assessed relationships of histologic features in BBD biopsies and patient characteristics with subsequent breast cancer risk and tested for heterogeneity of associations by estrogen receptor (ER) status, tumor grade, and size. The study included 514 invasive breast cancer cases (median follow-up of 9\u2009years post-BBD diagnosis) and 514 matched controls, diagnosed with proliferative or non-proliferative BBD between 1971 and 2006, with follow-up through mid-2015. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained using multivariable polytomous logistic regression models.Breast cancers were predominantly ER-positive (86%), well or moderately differentiated (73%), small (74% <\u200920\u2009mm), and stage I/II (91%). Compared to patients with non-proliferative BBD, proliferative BBD with atypia conferred increased\u00a0risk for ER-positive cancer\u00a0(OR\u2009=\u20095.48, 95% CI\u2009=\u20092.14-14.01) with only one ER-negative case, P-heterogeneity\u2009=\u20090.45. The presence of columnar cell lesions (CCLs) at BBD diagnosis was associated with a 1.5-fold increase in the risk of both ER-positive and ER-negative tumors, with a 2-fold increase (95% CI\u2009=\u20091.21-3.58) observed among postmenopausal women (56%), independent of proliferative BBD status with and without atypia. We did not identify statistically significant differences in risk factor associations by tumor grade or size.Most tumors that developed after a BBD diagnosis in this cohort were highly treatable low-stage ER-positive tumors. CCL in BBD biopsies may be associated with moderately increased risk, independent of BBD histology, and irrespective of ER status.",
  "Breast cancer incidence is rising in Africa, but there are scare data regarding risk factors in this region. We assessed the relation between risk factors and the occurrence of breast cancer, overall and by tumor subtype in women from Mozambique.The associations between education, number of births, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), and breast cancer risk among 138 cases (participants from the Moza-BC cohort) and 638 controls from the general population (from a World Health Organization stepwise approach to surveillance survey), recruited during 2014 to 2017, were investigated. Adjusted ORs (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using multivariable logistic regression.Multiparity (\u22656 vs. 0-1 live births) was a protective factor for the development of hormone receptor (HR)-positive (aOR = 0.22; 95% CI, 0.08-0.64) and HR-positive/HER2-negative tumors (aOR = 0.20; 95% CI, 0.06-0.68), whereas a higher educational level (\u22658 vs. 0 schooling years) increased breast cancer risk across all subtypes (overall aOR = 1.98; 95% CI, 1.04-3.80). Higher weight and BMI were associated with a higher breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women (per 1-kg increase: aOR = 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.08; per 1-kg/m<sup>2</sup> increase: aOR = 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04-1.18, respectively), but were protective in premenopausal women (aOR = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96-0.99; aOR = 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91-0.99, respectively), regardless of subtype. Higher height increased the risk of HR-negative tumors in postmenopause (per 10-cm increase: aOR = 2.81; 95% CI, 1.41-6.03).These results demonstrate the etiological heterogeneity of breast cancer among native African women, namely regarding the differential effect of multiparity, education, and body parameters in breast cancer risk.As the prevalence of obesity grows, these findings are important to inform public health policies on cancer prevention, by highlighting obesity as a modifiable risk factor for breast cancer among African women.",
  "Pregnancy associated breast cancer is a rare disease. It presents a unique entity of breast cancer with aggressive phenotype. The main aim was to evaluate how the international guidelines were followed in daily practice.Data concerning patients' and tumours' characteristics, management, delivery and maternal outcome were recorded from institutional electronic database. In this paper a case series of pregnant breast cancer patients treated at single tertiary institution between 2007 and 2019 are presented and the key recommendations on managing such patients are summarized.Fourteen patients met the search criteria. The majority of tumours were high grade, triple negative or HER2 positive, two patients were de novo metastatic. Treatment plan was made for each patient by multidisciplinary team. Eight patients were treated with systemic chemotherapy with no excess toxicity or severe maternal/fetal adverse effects. In all but two patients, delivery was on term and without major complications. Only one event, which was not in whole accordance with international guidelines, was identified. It was the use of blue dye in one patient.Women with pregnancy associated breast cancer should be managed like non-pregnant breast cancer patients and should expect a similar outcome, without causing harm to the unborn child. To achieve a good outcome in pregnancy associated breast cancer, a multidisciplinary approach is mandatory.",
  "A premalignant lesion in the breast is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. The aim of this article was to identify women with an increased risk of breast cancer based on prior screening results (PSRs).This registry-based cohort study followed women who participated in the organized breast cancer screening program in Norway, BreastScreen Norway, in 1995-2016. Incidence rates and incidence rate ratios were used to estimate absolute and relative risks of breast cancer associated with PSRs. Histopathological characteristics of subsequent breast cancers were presented by PSRs.This study included 762,643 women with up to 21\u00a0years of follow-up. In comparison with negatively screened women, increased incidence rate ratios of 1.8, 2.0, 2.9, and 3.8 were observed after negative additional imaging, for benign biopsy, for hyperplasia with atypia, and for carcinoma in situ, respectively. Subsequent breast cancers did not differ in tumor diameter or histological grade, whereas the proportion of lymph node-positive breast cancers decreased as the presumed malignancy potential of PSRs increased.The risk of subsequent breast cancer increased with the presumed malignancy potential of PSRs, whereas the tumor characteristics of subsequent cancers did not differ except for the lymph node status. Women with screen-detected benign lesions or hyperplasia with atypia might benefit from more frequent screening.",
  "Black women with breast cancer have lower survival rates and higher recurrence rates in comparison with white women. This study compared treatment and survival outcomes for black and white women at a highly specialized tertiary care cancer center.An institutional review board-approved, retrospective institutional database review was performed to identify all black women treated for invasive breast cancer between 2005 and 2010. Women with a prior history of breast cancer, stage IV cancer, or bilateral breast cancer were excluded. White women had similar exclusion criteria applied and were then matched to black women 1:1 by age and diagnosis year. Clinicopathologic and treatment variables were compared by race. Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to estimate overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS); a multivariable analysis was conducted with Cox regression models.The study group consisted of 1332 women (666 black). The median tumor size was larger in black women (1.6 vs 1.3\u00a0cm; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Black women had more nodal disease (41.1% vs 32%; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and had tumors that were more frequently an estrogen receptor-negative (32.9% vs 15%; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), progesterone receptor-negative (47.1% vs 30.2%; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), or triple-negative (TN) subtype (24% vs 8.9%; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) in comparison with white women. Black women also had inferior DFS and OS; race was not an independent prognostic indicator in the multivariable analysis.Black women had more advanced disease and adverse prognostic indicators at diagnosis, but race was not an independent predictor of outcome. Black women were significantly more likely to have TN breast cancer. Further research is necessary to understand the differences in tumor biology associated with race.",
  "The impact of variations in serum thyroid hormone concentration within the euthyroid range on breast cancer risk remains unclear. We investigated the effect of serum thyrotropin (TSH) and thyroid hormone concentration on breast cancer risk. This cohort study involved 62,546 Korean women, aged \u226540\u2009years, who were free of breast cancer at baseline and underwent health examination with determination of free thyroxine (FT4) and TSH. A parametric proportional hazard model was used to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). During a median follow-up of 4.8 years (interquartile range: 2.8-7.3 years), 834 incident breast cancers were identified. Compared to normal FT4 level, abnormally high serum FT4 level was associated with an increased risk of incident breast cancer with a corresponding multivariable aHR (95% CI) of 1.98 (1.02-3.83). This association tended to be stronger in postmenopausal women than in premenopausal women. Within the euthyroid range, the highest TSH tertile was associated with a lower risk of breast cancer than the lowest TSH tertile with a corresponding aHR (95% CI) of 0.68 (0.55-0.84). In contrast, highest FT4 tertile was associated with a higher risk of breast cancer than the lowest FT4 tertile. Abnormally high FT4 as well as higher FT4 within the euthyroid range were positively associated with breast cancer risk, while higher TSH concentration within the euthyroid range was negatively associated with breast cancer risk. Our findings indicate that thyroid function within both the abnormal and euthyroid ranges may contribute to the development of breast cancer.",
  "Although chemotherapy-induced leukoencephalopathy has been described in case and cohort studies, literature remains inconclusive about its prevalence and mechanisms. Therefore, we investigated the presence of leukoencephalopathy after multiagent chemotherapy in women treated for breast cancer and potential underlying neuroinflammatory processes.In this exploratory study, 15 chemotherapy-treated and 15 age-matched chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients with early-stage breast cancer, as well as 15 healthy controls underwent simultaneous PET-MR neuroimaging, including T1-weighted MPRAGE, T2-weighted FLAIR and dynamic PET with the 18-kDA translocator protein (TSPO) radioligand [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714. Total and regional (juxtacortical, periventricular, deep white matter and infratentorial) lesion burden were compared between the groups with one-way ANOVA. With paired t-tests, [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714 volume of distribution [V<sub>T</sub>, including partial volume correction (PVC)] in lesioned and normal appearing white matter (NAWM) were compared within subjects, to investigate inflammation. Finally, two general linear models were used to examine the predictive values of neurofilament light-chain (NfL) serum levels on (1) total lesion burden or (2) PVC [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714 V<sub>T</sub> of lesions showing elevated inflammation.No significant differences were found in total or localized lesion burden. However, significantly higher (20-45%) TSPO uptake was observed in juxtacortical lesions (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.008, t\u00a0\u2265\u00a03.90) compared to NAWM in both cancer groups, but only persisted for chemotherapy-treated patients after PVC (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005, t\u00a0=\u00a04.30). NfL serum levels were not associated with total lesion volume or tracer uptake in juxtacortical lesions.This multimodal neuroimaging study suggests that neuroinflammatory processes could be involved in the development of juxtacortical, but not periventricular or deep white matter, leukoencephalopathy shortly after chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer.",
  "Due to the higher incidence of hormone responsive tumours in women >50, the safety of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in older breast cancer survivors may differ from younger age groups. The primary outcome in this review was the risk of tumour recurrence and secondary outcome the relationship with breast cancer-related mortality. Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane, Google Scholar and EMBASE databases were searched through August 2018 for studies reporting exposure to HRT in survivors \u226550\u202fat primary diagnosis. Random effects models were used to estimate the combined relative risk (RR) of tumour recurrence and breast cancer-related mortality using the Mantel-Haenszel method and the quality of evidence determined for the primary outcome. Overall, nine studies (four cohort, one case-control, four RCTs; n\u202f=\u202f16,002) were included. Very low quality evidence from observational studies demonstrated no adverse effect on tumour recurrence with HRT use (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.19; I<sup>2</sup>\u202f=\u202f66%; n\u202f=\u202f11,984), while moderate quality evidence from RCTS demonstrated an adverse effect (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.77; I<sup>2</sup>\u202f=\u202f17%; n\u202f=\u202f4108). Similarly, observational studies demonstrated no adverse effect on breast cancer-related mortality (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.49; I<sup>2</sup>\u202f=\u202f0%, n\u202f=\u202f2182), while RCTs demonstrated a non-significant higher risk (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.49; I<sup>2</sup>\u202f=\u202f0%; n\u202f=\u202f3918). Ultimately, despite conflicting findings, evidence of sufficient quality suggests that HRT may increase the risk of tumour recurrence in older survivors. However, adverse effect on mortality is unlikely. Caution with HRT use in survivors is further advised.",
  "Obesity fosters worse clinical outcomes in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women with breast cancer. Emerging evidence suggests that an android body fat distribution in particular is deleterious for breast cancer prognosis. The extent of adipose tissue dysfunction, especially how it relates to breast cancer prognostic factors and anthropometric measurements, has not been fully investigated.Our objective was to examine if markers of adipose tissue dysfunction, such as hypertrophy and macrophage accumulation, are relevant for the pathophysiology of breast cancer and its associated prognostic factors in a well-characterised cohort of women with breast cancer who did not receive treatment before surgery.A consecutive series of 164 women with breast cancer provided breast adipose tissue sample. Multivariate generalised linear models were used to test associations of anthropometric indices and prognostic factors with markers of adipose tissue dysfunction.We found associations of breast adipocyte size and macrophage infiltration (number of CD68+ cells/100 adipocytes) with adiposity, particularly a strong association between breast adipocyte size and central obesity, independent of total adiposity, age and menopausal status (\u03b2<sub>adj</sub>\u2009=\u20090.87; p\u2009=\u20090.0001). We also identified relationships of adipocyte hypertrophy and macrophage infiltration with prognostic factors, such as cancer stage and tumour grade (p\u2009<\u20090.05). RNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL6, TNF) and leptin was also increased as a function of adipocyte size and CD86+/CD11c+ macrophage number/100 adipocytes (p\u2009<\u20090.05).Our findings support the model of dysfunctional adipose tissue in obesity-associated breast cancer.",
  "The experience of older women during breast cancer treatment is insufficiently described by quantitative studies. This study aimed to systematically review qualitative data describing factors that influence older women's (\u226565 years old) experience with breast cancer treatment.A systematic review was performed in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA) principles. MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and EMBASE were searched (inception - 2020). Quality assessment of essential item reporting was performed using the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR) criteria. Common ideas were coded, thematically organized, and synthesized within a theoretical framework.Of 7,773 studies identified, twelve were included. The median SRQR score was 13.4 (range 11.3-15.9) (maximum score: 21). Data synthesis revealed that older women experienced breast cancer as a journey with challenges during each phase. During diagnosis, they delayed seeking medical help despite symptoms. Age and experience gave them perspective on the impact of their diagnosis. During decision-making, preconceptions and personal values determined choices. In the treatment phase, women experienced medical and social barriers to care. During the post-treatment phase, many experienced treatment adverse effects, but could move on or compartmentalize as coping mechanisms.Older women with breast cancer have unique challenges specific to each phase of their treatment journey. Older women may benefit from proactive treatment discussions with health care providers to address their specific needs, individualize care, and assist with cancer care navigation.",
  "Stromal and immune cell composition alterations in benign breast tissue associate with future cancer risk. Pilot data suggest the innate microbiome of normal breast tissue differs between women with and without breast cancer. Microbiome alterations might explain tissue microenvironment variations associated with disease status.Prospectively-collected sterile normal breast tissues from women with benign (n=16) or malignant (n=17) disease underwent 16SrRNA sequencing with Illumina MiSeq and Hybrid-denovo pipeline processing. Breast tissue was scored for fibrosis and fat percentages and immune cell infiltrates (lobulitis) classified as absent/mild/moderate/severe. Alpha and beta diversity were calculated on rarefied OTU data and associations analyzed with multiple linear regression and PERMANOVA.Breast tissue stromal fat% was lower and fibrosis% higher in benign disease versus cancer (median 30% versus 60%, p=0.01, 70% versus 30%, p=0.002, respectively). The microbiome varied with stromal composition. Alpha diversity (Chao1) correlated with fat% (r=0.38, p=0.02) and fibrosis% (r=-0.32, p=0.05) and associated with different microbial populations as indicated by beta diversity metrics (weighted UniFrac, p=0.08, fat%, p=0.07, fibrosis%). Permutation testing with FDR control revealed taxa differences for fat% in Firmicutes, Bacilli, Bacillales, Staphylococcaceae and genus Staphylococcus, and fibrosis% in Firmicutes, Spirochaetes, Bacilli, Bacillales, Spirochaetales, Proteobacteria RF32, Sphingomonadales, Staphylococcaceae, and genera Clostridium, Staphylococcus, Spirochaetes, Actinobacteria Adlercreutzia. Moderate/severe lobulitis was more common in cancer (73%) than benign disease (13%), p=0.003, but no significant microbial associations were seen.These data suggest a link between breast tissue stromal alterations and its microbiome, further supporting a connection between the breast tissue microenvironment and breast cancer.",
  "Breast cancer is currently one of the cancers with a higher mortality rate in the world. The biological research on anti-breast cancer drugs focuses on the activity of estrogen receptors alpha (ER[Formula: see text]), the pharmacokinetic properties and the safety of the compounds, which, however, is an expensive and time-consuming process. Developments of deep learning bring potential to efficiently facilitate the candidate drug selection against breast cancer.In this paper, we propose an Anti-Breast Cancer Drug selection method utilizing Gated Graph Neural Networks (ABCD-GGNN) to topologically enhance the molecular representation of candidate drugs. By constructing atom-level graphs through atomic descriptors for each distinct compound, ABCD-GGNN can topologically learn both the implicit structure and substructure characteristics of a candidate drug and then integrate the representation with explicit discrete molecular descriptors to generate a molecule-level representation. As a result, the representation of ABCD-GGNN can inductively predict the ER[Formula: see text], the pharmacokinetic properties and the safety of each candidate drug. Finally, we design a ranking operator whose inputs are the predicted properties so as to statistically select the appropriate drugs against breast cancer.Extensive experiments conducted on our collected anti-breast cancer candidate drug dataset demonstrate that our proposed method outperform all the other representative methods in the tasks of predicting ER[Formula: see text], and the pharmacokinetic properties and safety of the compounds. Extended result analysis demonstrates the efficiency and biological rationality of the operator we design to calculate the candidate drug ranking from the predicted properties.In this paper, we propose the ABCD-GGNN representation method to efficiently integrate the topological structure and substructure features of the molecules with the discrete molecular descriptors. With a ranking operator applied, the predicted properties efficiently facilitate the candidate drug selection against breast cancer.",
  "Breast cancer (BC) is responsible for 15% of all the cancer deaths among women in the USA. The tumor microenvironment (TME) has the potential to act as a driver of breast cancer progression and metastasis. The TME is composed of stromal cells within an extracellular matrix and soluble cytokines, chemokines and extracellular vesicles and nanoparticles that actively influence cell behavior. Extracellular vesicles include exosomes, microvesicles and large oncosomes that orchestrate fundamental processes during tumor progression through direct interaction with target cells. Long before tumor cell spread to future metastatic sites, tumor-secreted exosomes enter the circulation and establish distant pre-metastatic niches, hospitable and permissive milieus for metastatic colonization. Emerging evidence suggests that breast cancer exosomes promote tumor progression and metastasis by inducing vascular leakiness, angiogenesis, invasion, immunomodulation and chemoresistance. Exosomes are found in almost all physiological fluids including plasma, urine, saliva, and breast milk, providing a valuable resource for the development of non-invasive cancer biomarkers. Here, we review work on the role of exosomes in breast cancer progression and metastasis, and describe the most recent advances in models of exosome secretion, isolation, characterization and functional analysis. We highlight the potential applications of plasma-derived exosomes as predictive biomarkers for breast cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapy monitoring. We finally describe the therapeutic approaches of exosomes in breast cancer.",
  "There is a lack of evidence-based recommendations for the age at which women with a family history of cancers other than breast cancer should start breast cancer screening.Using Swedish family cancer data sets, the authors conducted a nationwide cohort study including 5,099,172 Swedish women born after 1931 (follow-up, 1958-2015). Accounting for calendar time, they calculated the relative risk of breast cancer for women with a family history of a discordant cancer in 1 first-degree relative. Furthermore, the authors used 10-year cumulative risk to determine the ages at which women with a family history of discordant cancer reached risk thresholds at which women in the general population were recommended to start breast cancer screening.A family history of cancer at 15 sites was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Among women younger than 50 years, the highest risk of breast cancer was observed for those with a family history of ovarian cancer (standardized incidence ratio, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-1.64). In these women, the risk of breast cancer associated with a family history at other cancer sites ranged from 1.08-fold for prostate cancer to 1.18-fold for liver cancer. When breast cancer screening was recommended to be started at the age of 50 years for the general population, women with 1 first-degree relative with ovarian cancer attained the threshold risk for screening at the age of 46 years. Women with a family history of other discordant cancers did not reach the risk thresholds for screening at younger ages.Many cancers showed familial associations with breast cancer, but women with a family history of these cancers (except for ovarian cancer) did not reach risk thresholds for screening at younger ages.",
  "Breast cancer onset is known to be younger in China when compared to many westernized countries, the reason remains unknown. This study aims to evaluate the clinical and pathological characteristics of young breast cancer in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, China.This is a 5-year retrospective review of a prospectively-maintained region-wide database. Patients treated in Hong Kong and Shenzhen between 2013 and 2017 were analysed.1610 breast cancer patients were identified for analysis, 1108 patients were from Hong Kong and 502 patients were from Shenzhen. Median age of breast cancer onset was 60 years old in Hong Kong (Range 21 - 103), while that in Shenzhen was 46 years old (Range 23 - 85). 59 (5.3%) patients from the Hong Kong cohort were younger than 40 years old at the age of diagnosis (i.e. young breast cancer), comparing to 152 (30.3%) patients from the Shenzhen cohort (p < 0.0001). There were more nulliparity, positive family history and use of exogenous hormones in young breast cancer patients in Hong Kong (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0043, < 0.0001 and 0.0022). Pathological characteristics were however comparable between the two cohorts, apart from being more triple negative breast cancers in young breast cancer patients in Hong Kong (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05).Age of onset of breast cancer tends to be younger in mainland China than in Hong Kong. Personal and familial risk factors were not significantly different. Environmental factor may play an important role.",
  "ITPR1 is a key gene for autophagy, but its biological function is still unclear, and there are few studies on the correlation between ITPR1 gene expression and the occurrence and development of breast cancer.Analyze the expression of ITPR1 through online databases such as Oncomine and TIMER. Kaplan-Meier plotter and other databases were used to evaluate the impact of ITPR1 on clinical prognosis. The expression of ITPR1 in analysis of 145 cases of breast cancer and 30 cases of adjacent normal tissue was detected by Immunohistochemistry. Statistical analysis was used to evaluate the clinical relevance and prognostic significance of abnormally expressed proteins. And the Western Blot was used to detect the expression of ITPR1 between breast cancer tissues and cells. The TIMER database studied the relationship between ITPR1 and cancer immune infiltration. And used the ROC plotter database to predict the response of ITPR1 to chemotherapy, endocrine therapy and anti-HER2 therapy in patients with breast cancer.Compared with normal breast samples, ITPR1 was significantly lower in patients with breast cancer. And the increased expression of ITPR1 mRNA was closely related to longer overall survival (OS), distant metastasis free survival (DMFS), disease specific survival (DSS) and relapse free survival (RFS) in breast cancer. And the expression level of ITPR1 was higher in patients treated with chemotherapy than untreated patients. In addition, the expression of ITPR1 was positively correlated with related gene markers of immune cells in different types of breast cancer, especially with BRCA basal tissue breast cancer.ITPR1 was lower expressed in breast cancer. The higher expression of ITPR1 suggested favorable prognosis for patients. ITPR1 was related to the level of immune infiltration, especially in BRCA-Basal patients. All research results indicated that ITPR1 might affect breast cancer prognosis and participate in immune regulation. In short, ITPR1 might be a potential target for breast cancer therapy.",
  "This article updates readers as to what is new in the Japanese Breast Cancer Society Clinical Practice Guidelines for Breast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis, 2018 Edition. Breast cancer screening issues are covered, including matters of breast density and possible supplemental modalities, along with appropriate pre-operative/follow-up diagnostic breast imaging tests. Up-to-date clinical practice guidelines for breast cancer screening and diagnosis should help to provide patients and clinicians with not only evidence-based breast imaging options, but also accurate and balanced information about the benefits and harms of intervention, which ultimately enables shared decision making about imaging test plans.",
  "Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) was overexpressed in many cancers, and high PKM2 expression was related with poor prognosis and chemoresistance.We investigated the expression of PKM2 in breast cancer and analyzed the relation of PKM2 expression with chemotherapy resistance to the neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). We also investigated whether PKM2 could reverse chemoresistance in breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed in 130 surgical resected breast cancer tissues. 78 core needle biopsies were collected from breast cancer patients before neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The relation of PKM2 expression and multi-drug resistance to NAC was compared. The effect of PKM2 silencing or overexpression on Doxorubicin (DOX) sensitivity in the MCF-7 cells in vitro and in vivo was compared.PKM2 was intensively expressed in breast cancer tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. In addition, high expression of PKM2 was associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. The NAC patients with high PKM2 expression had short survival. PKM2 was an independent prognostic predictor for surgical resected breast cancer and NAC patients. High PKM2 expression was correlated with neoadjuvant treatment resistance. High PKM2 expression significantly distinguished chemoresistant patients from chemosensitive patients. In vitro and in vivo knockdown of PKM2 expression decreases the resistance to DOX in breast cancer cells in vitro and tumors in vivo.PKM2 expression was associated with chemoresistance of breast cancers, and could be used to predict the chemosensitivity. Furthermore, targeting PKM2 could reverse chemoresistance, which provides an effective treatment methods for patients with breast cancer.",
  "Breast protontherapy efficiently limits cardiac, lung and contralateral breast exposure, which may clinically translate into better late tolerance profile compared with classic photon techniques. While breast protontherapy is already implemented in the United States and in some European countries, clinical experience of breast cancer protontherapy is currently limited in France. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical practice of breast cancer protontherapy at the Institut Curie in order to implement this technique at a larger scale.Data from all breast cancer patients that have been addressed to the protontherapy centre of Orsay (CPO, Institut Curie) for adjuvant breast protontherapy were retrieved. We analysed why these patients were ultimately treated with protontherapy or not.Between November 2019 and November 2020, eleven breast cancer patients have been evaluated for adjuvant protontherapy at the CPO. Two of them were ultimately treated with proton beams; adjuvant breast protontherapy therapy was well tolerated. The nine other patients were not treated with protontherapy due to lack of availability of protontherapy treatment rooms in acceptable time limits, at the time of patient evaluation.Despite dosimetric advantages and excellent clinical tolerance, lack of availability of protontherapy machines currently limits wider implementation of breast protontherapy.",
  "Cell division cycle protein (CDC20) has been observed to be expressed higher in various kinds of human cancers and was associated with poor prognosis. However, studies on role of CDC20 in breast cancer are seldom reported till now, most of which are not systematic and conclusive. The present study was performed to analyze the expression pattern, potential function, and distinct prognostic effect of CDC20 in breast cancer using several online databases including Oncomine, bc-GenExMiner, PrognoScan, and UCSC Xena. To verify the results from databases, we compared the mRNA CDC20 expression in breast cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues of patients by real-time PCR. We found that CDC20 was expressed higher in different types of breast cancer, comparing with normal tissues. Moreover, the patients with a more advanced stage of breast cancer tended to express higher level CDC20. CDC20 was expressed higher in breast cancer tissues than normal tissues from patients in our hospital, consistent with the results from databases. Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status were negatively correlated with CDC20 level. Conversely, Scarff-Bloom-Richardson (SBR) grade, Nottingham prognostic index (NPI), epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) status, basal-like status, and triple-negative status were positively related to CDC20 expression in breast cancer patients with respect to normal individuals. Higher CDC20 expression correlated with worse survival. Finally, a positive correlation between CDC20 and Targeting protein for Xenopus kinesin-like protein 2 (TPX2) expression was revealed. CDC20 could be considered as a potential predictive indicator for prognosis of breast cancer with co-expressed TPX2 gene.",
  "We developed tailored axillary surgery (TAS) to reduce the axillary tumor volume in patients with clinically node-positive breast cancer to the point where radiotherapy can control it. The aim of this study was to quantify the extent of tumor load reduction achieved by TAS.International multicenter prospective study embedded in a randomized trial. TAS is a novel pragmatic concept for axillary surgery de-escalation that combines palpation-guided removal of suspicious nodes with the sentinel procedure and, optionally, imaging-guided localization. Pre-specified study endpoints quantified surgical extent and reduction of tumor load.A total of 296 patients were included at 28 sites in four European countries, 125 (42.2%) of whom underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and 71 (24.0%) achieved nodal pathologic complete response. Axillary metastases were detectable only by imaging in 145 (49.0%) patients. They were palpable in 151 (51.0%) patients, of whom 63 underwent NACT and 21 had residual palpable disease after NACT. TAS removed the biopsied and clipped node in 279 (94.3%) patients. In 225 patients with nodal disease at the time of surgery, TAS removed a median of five (IQR 3-7) nodes, two (IQR 1-4) of which were positive. Of these 225 patients, 100 underwent ALND after TAS, which removed a median of 14 (IQR 10-17) additional nodes and revealed additional positive nodes in 70/100 (70%) of patients. False-negative rate of TAS in patients who underwent subsequent ALND was 2.6%.TAS selectively reduced the tumor load in the axilla and remained much less radical than ALND.",
  "The introduction of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) directed therapy has transformed the outcomes of patients with advanced breast cancer (BC). However, HER2 positive breast cancer has a predilection for the central nervous system (CNS) which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Understanding the intracranial activity of novel HER2 directed agents is key to developing treatments as well as possible preventative strategies for HER2-positive CNS disease.Using protocols and data from published phase III clinical trials for locally advanced/metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer since the licensing of single agent trastuzumab for advanced BC we review the central nervous system related aspects. This includes CNS related entry criteria, use of baseline and on study cross-sectional imaging of the CNS and protocol and non-protocol defined CNS end points and reported data.and Relevance: This review found heterogeneity between studies with regard to the entry criteria, use of CNS imaging and reported end points within the pivotal phase III studies. Based on these data, a standardisation of both entry criteria and end points with regard to the CNS should be developed and applied to future studies of HER2-positive advanced BC. Such an approach would enable the generation of comparable data and allow a meaningful analysis of different treatment approaches with regard to the CNS. This in turn would allow the development of the most optimal treatment approaches for HER2 positive CNS disease and ultimately the development of preventative strategies.",
  "About 30%-40% breast cancer patients suffer from recurrence and metastasis, even after targeted therapy like trastuzumab. Since breast cancer recurrence and metastasis are intrinsically related to mortality, it is critical to predict the recurrence and metastasis risk of an individual patient, which is essential for adjuvant therapy and early intervention. In this study, we developed a novel breast cancer recurrence and metastasis risk assessment framework from histopathological images using image features and machine learning technologies. The detection framework was applied on a manually collected clinical dataset from the Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, consisting of 127 breast cancer patients with known prognostic information; and further independently validated on 88 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) with known recurrence and metastasis status. As a result, the XGBoost-based method performed well using only 8 texture and color features, obtained internal testing AUC of 0.75 on clinical data and external testing AUC of 0.72 on TCGA FFPE data, respectively. In addition, this study found two important potential predictors, i.e., the second moment of the B color component and the detail level mean square error of the wavelet multi-sub-bands co-occurrence matrix. Our study benchmarked the performances of histopathological image features and machine learning technologies in the recurrence and metastasis risk assessment, and holds promise for relieving pathologists' workload and boosting the survival chances of the breast cancer patients.",
  "Breast cancer diagnosed within 5 to 10 years after childbirth, called postpartum breast cancer (PPBC), is associated with increased risk for metastasis and death. Whether a postpartum diagnosis is an independent risk factor or a surrogate marker of cancer features associated with poor outcomes remains understudied.To determine whether diagnostic temporal proximity to childbirth is associated with features of breast cancer associated with poor outcomes, including tumor stage, estrogen receptor (ER) status, and risk for distant metastasis and breast cancer-specific mortality, using a population database from the state of Utah.This population-based cohort study using the Utah Population Database (UPDB) included individuals with stage I to III breast cancer diagnosed at age 45 years or younger between 1996 and 2017, followed-up until February 2020. Participant data were analyzed from November 2019 to August 2022.The primary exposures were no prior childbirth or time between most recent childbirth and breast cancer diagnosis. Patients were grouped by diagnoses within less than 5 years, 5 to less than 10 years, or 10 years or more since recent childbirth.The 2 primary outcomes were distant metastasis-free survival and breast cancer-specific death. Cox proportional hazard models were used to investigate associations between exposures and outcomes adjusting for diagnosis year, patient age, tumor stage, and estrogen receptor (ER) status.Of 2970 individuals with breast cancer diagnosed at age 45 years or younger (mean [SD] age, 39.3 [5.0] years; 12 Black individuals [0.4%], 2679 White individuals [90.2%]), breast cancer diagnosis within 5 years of recent childbirth was independently associated with approximately 1.5-fold elevated risk for metastasis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-2.0) and breast cancer-specific death (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.1) compared with nulliparous individuals. For cancers classically considered to have tumor features associated with good outcomes (ie, stage I or II and ER-positive), a postpartum diagnosis was a dominant feature associated with increased risk for metastasis and death (eg, for individuals with ER-positive disease diagnosed within <5 years of childbirth: age-adjusted metastasis HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.1; P\u2009=\u2009.01; age-adjusted death HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.0-2.1; P\u2009=\u2009.04) compared with nulliparous individuals. Furthermore, liver metastases were specifically increased in the group with diagnosis within 5 years postpartum and with positive ER expression (38 of 83 patients [45.8%]) compared with the nulliparous (28 of 77 patients [36.4%]), although the difference was not statistically significant. Overall, these data implicate parity-associated breast and liver biology in the observed poor outcomes of PPBC.In this cohort study of individuals with breast cancer diagnosed at age 45 years or younger, a postpartum breast cancer diagnosis was a risk factor associated with poor outcomes. Irrespective of ER status, clinical consideration of time between most recent childbirth and breast cancer diagnosis could increase accuracy of prognosis in patients with young-onset breast cancer.",
  "Corona Virus Disease 19 (COVID-19) had a worldwide negative impact on healthcare systems, which were not used to coping with such pandemic. Adaptation strategies prioritizing COVID-19 patients included triage of patients and reduction or re-allocation of other services. The aim of our survey was to provide a real time international snapshot of modifications of breast cancer management during the COVID-19 pandemic.A survey was developed by a multidisciplinary group on behalf of European Breast Cancer Research Association of Surgical Trialists and distributed via breast cancer societies. One reply per breast unit was requested.In ten days, 377 breast centres from 41 countries completed the questionnaire. RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 prior to treatment was reported by 44.8% of the institutions. The estimated time interval between diagnosis and treatment initiation increased for about 20% of institutions. Indications for primary systemic therapy were modified in 56% (211/377), with upfront surgery increasing from 39.8% to 50.7% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.002) and from 33.7% to 42.2% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.016) in T1cN0 triple-negative and ER-negative/HER2-positive cases, respectively. Sixty-seven percent considered that chemotherapy increases risks for developing COVID-19 complications. Fifty-one percent of the responders reported modifications in chemotherapy protocols. Gene-expression profile used to evaluate the need for adjuvant chemotherapy increased in 18.8%. In luminal-A tumours, a large majority (68%) recommended endocrine treatment to postpone surgery. Postoperative radiation therapy was postponed in 20% of the cases.Breast cancer management was considerably modified during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our data provide a base to investigate whether these changes impact oncologic outcomes.",
  "Breast cancer is the most common cancer type in females, and exploring the mechanisms of disease progression is playing a crucial role in the development of potential therapeutics. Pituitary tumor-transforming gene (PTTG) family members are well documented to be involved in cell-cycle regulation and mitosis, and contribute to cancer development by their involvement in cellular transformation in several tumor types. The critical roles of PTTG family members as crucial transcription factors in diverse types of cancers are recognized, but how they regulate breast cancer development still remains mostly unknown. Meanwhile, a holistic genetic analysis exploring whether PTTG family members regulate breast cancer progression via the cell cycle as well as the energy metabolism-related network is lacking. To comprehensively understand the messenger RNA expression profiles of PTTG proteins in breast cancer, we herein conducted a high-throughput screening approach by integrating information from various databases such as Oncomine, Kaplan-Meier Plotter, Metacore, ClueGo, and CluePedia. These useful databases and tools provide expression profiles and functional analyses. The present findings revealed that PTTG1 and PTTG3 are two important genes with high expressions in breast cancer relative to normal breast cells, implying their unique roles in breast cancer progression. Results of our coexpression analysis demonstrated that PTTG family genes were positively correlated with thiamine triphosphate (TTP), deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) metabolic, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and cell-cycle related pathways. Meanwhile, through Cytoscape analyzed indicated that in addition to the metastasis markers AURKA, AURKB, and NDC80, many of the kinesin superfamily (KIF) members including KIFC1, KIF2C, KIF4A, KIF14, KIF20A, KIF23, were also correlated with PTTG family transcript expression. Finally, we revealed that high levels of PTTG1 and PTTG3 transcription predicted poor survival, which provided useful insights into prospective research of cancer associated with the PTTG family. Therefore, these members of the PTTG family would serve as distinct and essential prognostic biomarkers in breast cancer.",
  "As Asians are more vulnerable to febrile neutropenia (FN) than Caucasians, evaluations of FN incidence and risk factors in Asians are important for the appropriate use of primary pegfilgrastim (PEG-G).Japanese breast cancer patients receiving standard adjuvant chemotherapies were prospectively enrolled in multicenter institutions from August 2015 to July 2017. FN was evaluated from 2 treatment policies: true FN (T-FN): \u226537.5\u00a0\u00b0C, grade 4 neutropenia, mandatory hospital visit (visiting); surrogate FN (S-FN): \u226537.5\u00a0\u00b0C, oral antibiotic, no mandatory visit (non-visiting). PEG-G was used at the physicians' discretion. The primary endpoint was FN incidence during all cycles. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify T-FN risk factors.Of 1005 enrolled patients, 980 women treated with FEC, E(A)C, and TC were analyzed. The FN incidence proportions in all patients were 22.5%, 27.5%, and 33.9% for FEC, E(A)C, and TC, respectively. Those of T-FN were 27.7%, 22.4%, and 36.6%; those of S-FN were 17.3%, 32.4%, and 31.5% with more frequent primary PEG-G usage. The relative dose intensity (RDI) of the 3 regimens was \u22650.85 in both groups. In the analysis of risk factors, TC (odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a02.67), age\u00a0\u2265\u00a065 years (2.24), and pretreatment absolute neutrophil count (ANC)/1000\u00a0\u03bcl (0.8) remained significant.FN incidences were above 20% in the 3 regimens, with TC showing the highest. RDI was maintained at a high level in both visiting and non-visiting groups. Patient-related risk factors were age and pretreatment ANC.",
  "The University of Alabama at Birmingham Preventative Care Program for Women's Cancer provides genetic testing, risk evaluation, and screening for breast cancer. Women diagnosed with high-risk mutations may opt to undergo active surveillance or prophylactic surgery. This decision requires understanding of the surveillance process and its potential outcomes. In this study, we report specifically on women with non-BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.A retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted of women enrolled in our program identified as high risk because of non-BRCA mutations. Events regarding genetic mutations, method of detection of suspicious lesions, number of biopsies, results of those biopsies, prophylactic surgery, and cancer diagnosis were collected.We identified 78 patients with asymptomatic non-BRCA deleterious mutations. Sixteen mutations were identified, with the most common being ATM, CHEK2, and PALB2. In total, 11.5% underwent prophylactic surgery and 88.5% underwent active surveillance. In the surveillance group, 63.8% had no examination or imaging to warrant biopsy, 24.6% had biopsy with benign result, and 11.6% had biopsy with malignant result. For the nine women who developed breast cancer during surveillance, six were diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ, two with stage I, and one with stage IIA cancer.Women with non-BRCA mutations enroll in prevention clinics with hopes of early detection of breast cancer. Because of increased screening, this population undergoes biopsy more frequently; however, during surveillance most do not require a biopsy. For those that do, the result is typically benign. This information can further allow women to make informed decisions about surveillance and establish realistic expectations regarding the likelihood of tissue sampling.",
  "The purpose of this study was to investigate whether pretreatment kinetic features from ultrafast DCE-MRI are associated with pathological complete response (pCR) in patients with invasive breast cancer and according to immunohistochemistry (IHC) subtype.Between August 2018 and June 2019, 256 consecutive breast cancer patients (mean age, 50.2\u00a0years; range, 25-86\u00a0years) who underwent both ultrafast and conventional DCE-MRI and surgery following neoadjuvant chemotherapy were included. DCE-MRI kinetic features were obtained from pretreatment MRI data. Time-to-enhancement, maximal slope (MS), and volumes at U1 and U2 (U1, time point at which the lesion starts to enhance; U2, subsequent time point after U1) were derived from ultrafast MRI. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with pCR.Overall, 41.4% of all patients achieved pCR. None of the kinetic features was associated with pCR when including all cancers. Among ultrafast DCE-MRI kinetic features, a lower MS (OR, 0.982; p\u2009=\u20090.040) was associated with pCR at univariable analysis in hormone receptor (HR)-positive cancers. In triple-negative cancers, a higher volume ratio U1/U2 was associated with pCR at univariable (OR, 11.787; p\u2009=\u20090.006) and multivariable analysis (OR, 14.811; p\u2009=\u20090.005). Among conventional DCE-MRI kinetic features, a lower peak enhancement (OR, 0.993; p\u2009=\u20090.031) and a lower percentage of washout (OR, 0.904; p\u2009=\u20090.039) was associated with pCR only in HR-positive cancers at univariable analysis.A higher volume ratio of U1/U2 derived from ultrafast DCE-MRI was independently associated with pCR in triple-negative invasive breast cancer.\u2022 The ratio of tumor volumes obtained at the first (U1) and second time points (U2) of enhancement was independently associated with pCR in triple-negative invasive breast cancers. \u2022 Ultrafast MRI has the potential to improve accuracy in predicting treatment response and personalizing therapy.",
  "Hard antler extract (HAE) is a traditional Chinese medicine and has potent antitumor, antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory activities. Previous studies have demonstrated that HAE can inhibit human prostate cancer metastasis and murine breast cancer proliferation. However, the effect of HAE on human breast cancer cells has not been clarified.To investigate the effects and underlying mechanism of HAE on self-renewal of stem-like cells and spontaneous and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21-enhanced wound healing, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in breast cancer cells.HAE was prepared from sika deer by sequential enzymatic digestions and the active compounds were determined by HPLC. The effects of HAE on the viability, mammosphere formation, wound healing and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR3 cells were determined. The impact of HAE treatment on spontaneous and TGF-\u03b21-promoted EMT and the nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB signaling in breast cancer cells was examined by quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting.Treatment with HAE at varying concentrations did not change the viability of breast cancer cells. However, HAE at 0.25 or 0.5\u00a0mg/mL significantly reduced the number and size of formed mammospheres, and inhibited spontaneous and TGF-\u03b21-enhanced wound healing, invasion and EMT in MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR3 cells in a dose-dependent manner. TGF-\u03b21 treatment significantly decreased I\u03baB\u03b1 expression and increased NF-kBp65 phosphorylation in breast cancer cells, indicating that TGF-\u03b21 enhanced NF-\u03baB signaling. In contrast, HAE treatment attenuated the spontaneous and TGF-\u03b21-enhanced NF-\u03baB signaling in breast cancer cells.Our data indicated that HAE inhibited the self-renewal of stem-like cells and spontaneous and TGF-\u03b21-enhanced wound healing, invasion and EMT in breast cancer cells by attenuating the NF-\u03baB signaling in vitro.",
  "The axillary reverse mapping (ARM) technique, identify and preserve arm nodes during sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), was developed to prevent breast-cancer related lymphedema (BCRL) remains controversial.A comprehensive search of Medline Ovid, Pubmed, Web of Science and the Cochrane CENTRAL databases was conducted from the inception till January 2020. The key word including \"breast cancer\", \"axillary reverse mapping\", and \"lymphedema\". Stata 15.1 software was used for the meta-analysis.As a result, twenty-nine related studies involving 4954 patients met our inclusion criteria. The pooled overall estimate lymphedema incidence was 7% (95% CI 4%-11%, I<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a090.35%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), with SLNB showed a relatively lower pooled incidence of lymphedema (2%, 95% CI 1%-3%), I<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a026.06%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.23) than that of ALND (14%, 95% CI 5%-26%, I<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a093.28%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) or SLNB and ALND combined (11%, 95% CI 1%-30%). The ARM preservation during ALND procedure could significantly reduce upper extremity lymphedema in contrast with ARM resection (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.27, 95% CI 0.20-0.36, I<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a031%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.161). Intriguingly, the result favored ALND-ARM over standard-ALND in preventing lymphedema occurrence (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.21, 95% CI 0.14-0.31, I<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a043%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.153). The risk of metastases in the ARM-nodes was not significantly lower in the patients who had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, as compared to those without neoadjuvant treatment (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.20, 95% CI 0.74-1.94, I<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a049.4%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.095).ARM was found to significantly reduce the incidence of BCRL. The selection of patients for this procedure should be based on their axillary nodal status. Preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy has no significant impact on the ARM lymph node metastasis rate.",
  "To investigate the association between gut microbiome with breast tumor characteristics (receptor status, stage and grade) and known breast cancer risk factors.In a pilot cross-sectional study of 37 incident breast cancer patients, fecal samples collected prior to chemotherapy were analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene-based sequencing protocol. Alpha diversity and specific taxa by tumor characteristics and breast cancer risk factors were tested by Wilcoxon rank sum test, and by differential abundance analysis, using a zero-inflated negative binomial regression model with adjustment for total counts, age and race/ethnicity.There were no significant alpha diversity or phyla differences by estrogen/progesterone\u00a0receptor status, tumor grade, stage, parity and body mass index. However, women with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+) (n\u2009=\u200912) compared to HER2- (n\u2009=\u200925) breast cancer showed 12-23% lower alpha diversity [number of species (OTU) p\u2009=\u20090.033, Shannon index p\u2009=\u20090.034], lower abundance of Firmicutes (p\u2009=\u20090.005) and higher abundance of Bacteroidetes (p\u2009=\u20090.089). Early menarche (ages\u2009\u2264\u200911) (n\u2009=\u200911) compared with later menarche (ages\u2009\u2265\u200912) (n\u2009=\u200926) was associated with lower OTU (p\u2009=\u20090.036), Chao1 index (p\u2009=\u20090.020) and lower abundance of Firmicutes (p\u2009=\u20090.048). High total body fat (TBF) (>\u200946%) (n\u2009=\u200912) compared to lower (\u2264\u200946%) TBF was also associated with lower Chao 1 index (p\u2009=\u20090.011). There were other significant taxa abundance differences by HER2 status, menarche age, as well as other tumor and breast cancer risk factors.Further studies are needed to identify characteristics of the human microbiome and the interrelationships between breast cancer hormone receptor status and established breast cancer risk factors.",
  "Annual MRI screening is associated with a significant reduction in advanced-stage breast cancer diagnosis in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. The impact that early detection has on subsequent oncological treatment is less frequently reported. In this study we compared disease stage and therapeutic approaches in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who developed breast cancer while adhering to the recommended surveillance scheme (\"known carriers\"), with women who became aware of their BRCA mutation status after breast cancer diagnosis (\"latent carriers\").Data on tumor characteristics, disease stage, and therapeutic decisions were collected on BRCA1/2 mutation carriers treated for breast cancer at the Chaim Sheba Medical Center.Data were available for 298 BRCA1/2 carriers. Median follow-up was 77.4 months (range, 3.5-520). Age at diagnosis was not statistically different between known carriers (n\u202f=\u202f96; median age at diagnosis 44.7 years) and latent carriers (n\u202f=\u202f202; 43.7 years); p\u202f=\u202f0.8284. Of known carriers, 19.8% were diagnosed with carcinoma in situ vs. 5% of latent carriers (p\u202f=\u202f0.0012). Stage T1N0 disease was diagnosed in 54/96 (56.3%) of known carriers vs. 59/202 (29.2%) of latent carriers (p\u202f<\u202f0.00001). Neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy was administered to 46/96 (47.9%) of known carriers compared with 162/202 (80.2%) of latent carriers (p\u202f<\u202f0.00001).While early stage breast cancer was diagnosed frequently among known BRCA1/2 carriers under tight surveillance, almost half of these women were treated with chemotherapy. Healthy BRCA1/2 mutation carriers should be informed about these rates while discussing risk-reducing surgical options.",
  "This study assessed chemotherapy use trends before (neoadjuvant chemotherapy [NAC]) or after surgery (adjuvant chemotherapy [AdC]) among older women with breast cancer and examined factors related to NAC receipt.Women (>\u200965\u00a0years) diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer during 2010-2017 who received NAC or AdC were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. All patients were stratified into six strata based on subtype (hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative [HR\u2009+\u2009/HER2-], HER2\u2009+\u2009, and triple-negative breast cancer [TNBC]) and stage (I-II and III). Cochran-Armitage tests were performed to test temporal trends of NAC use in each stratum. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors (sociodemographic and clinical) related to NAC use.Among included older (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation: 72.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.2\u00a0years) women (N\u2009=\u20098,495) with stage I-III breast cancer, NAC use increased from 11.7% (2010) to 32.6% (2017). Significant increases in NAC were found in all strata (p\u2009<\u2009.0001) with more substantial increases in HER2\u2009+\u2009disease and TNBC compared to HR\u2009+\u2009/HER2- disease. Multivariable logistic regressions identified the youngest age category (66-69\u00a0years) and later stage as significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05) predictors of NAC receipt in most strata, in addition to diagnosis year.Similar to the overall breast cancer population, NAC use increased among a population of older women. NAC was received by most patients with stage III HER2\u2009+\u2009disease or TNBC in more recent years and was more common among younger elderly women and those in stage III.",
  "Patients diagnosed with metastatic cancer have shortened life expectancy with questionable benefit of routine screening mammography (SM). The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and consequences of continued SM in the setting of reduced survival from stage IV non-breast cancer.Women diagnosed with Stage IV non-breast cancer at a single institution from 2015 to 2019 were queried from the institutional tumor registry for demographics, stage IV cancer diagnosis, and survival. Incidence and timing of SM after stage IV diagnosis and further diagnostic workup were extracted from the medical record.790 women with Stage IV non-breast cancer were identified, 109 (14%) had at least 1 SM, 23% required diagnostic mammography, 7% breast biopsy, and 1% breast surgery. No breast cancers were identified. SM was ordered most often in stage IV gynecological cancers (28%), with more common cancers still seeing a high percentage of patients screened (lung 10%, colorectal 15%). Study 3-year survival was 26% (95% confidence interval [CI] 23-30%), with 74% mortality during follow up and median time from Stage IV diagnosis to death of 1.2 years (CI 0.4-2.3\u00a0years). Of patients screened, 41/109 died within 2 years of undergoing SM.Despite low overall survival for patients diagnosed with metastatic non-breast cancer, 14% of women underwent SM which resulted in additional imaging, biopsies, and surgery with no new breast cancers identified. Continued SM in this population offers risk without benefit of reduced breast cancer mortality and should no longer continue in women with stage IV non-breast cancer.",
  "We aimed to explore whether the type of mammographic feature prompting a false-positive recall (FPR) during mammography screening influences the risk and timing of breast cancer diagnosis, particularly if assessed with invasive procedures.We included information on women screened and recalled for further assessment in Spain between 1994 and 2015, with follow-up until 2017, categorizing FPRs by the assessment (noninvasive or invasive) and mammographic feature prompting the recall.Breast cancer rates in the first two years after FPR (first period) and after two years (second period).The study included 99,825 women with FPRs. In both periods, the breast cancer rate was higher in the invasive assessment group than in the noninvasive group (first period 12 \u2030 vs 1.9 \u2030, p\u202f<\u202f0.001; second period 4.4\u2030 vs 3.1\u2030, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). During the first period, the invasive assessment group showed diverse breast cancer rates for each type of mammographic feature, with a higher rate for asymmetric density (31.9\u2030). When the second period was compared with the first, the breast cancer rate decreased in the invasive assessment group (from 12\u2030 to 4.4\u2030, p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and increased in the noninvasive assessment group (from 1.9\u2030 to 3.1\u2030, p\u202f<\u202f0.001).In the context of mammography screening, the risk of breast cancer diagnosis during the first two years after FPR was particularly high for women undergoing invasive assessment; importantly, the risk was modified by type of mammographic feature prompting the recall. This information could help to individualize follow-up after exclusion of malignancy.",
  "Dysregulated miRNAs are involved in carcinogenesis of the breast and may be used as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets during the cancer process. The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of miR-105-3p on the tumourigenicity of breast cancer and its underlying molecular mechanisms.Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was applied to detect the expression of miR-105-3p in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. The impacts of miR-105-3p on the proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis of human breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and ZR-75-30) were evaluated by CCK-8 assays, Transwell chamber assays, TUNEL assays and western blot analyses. In addition, bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays were used to determine the target genes of miR-105-3p.The expression of miR-105-3p was elevated in breast cancer tissues and increased with tumour severity. Downregulation of miR-105-3p could inhibit cell proliferation, suppress cell migration/invasion, and promote cell apoptosis in MCF-7 and ZR-75-30 cells. Furthermore, Golgi integral membrane protein 4 (GOLIM4) was identified as the direct target gene of miR-105-3p by bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays. In addition, silencing GOLIM4 restored the anti-breast cancer effects induced by miR-105-3p downregulation.MiR-105-3p acts as an oncogene to promote the proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer cells by targeting GOLIM4, which provides a new target for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer.",
  "This study sought to determine the impact of pregnancy or assisted reproductive technologies (ART) on breast-cancer-specific survival among breast cancer survivors.The authors performed a cohort study using a novel data linkage from the California Cancer Registry, the California birth cohort, and the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology Clinic Outcome Reporting System data sets. They performed risk-set matching in women with stages I-III breast cancer diagnosed between 2000 and 2012. For each pregnant woman, comparable women who were not pregnant at that point but were otherwise similar based on observed characteristics were matched at the time of pregnancy. After matching, Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association of pregnancy with breast-cancer-specific survival. We repeated these analyses for women who received ART.Among 30,021 women with breast cancer, 553 had a pregnancy and 189 attempted at least one cycle of ART. In Cox proportional hazards modeling, the pregnancy group had a higher 5-year disease-specific survival rate; 95.6% in the pregnancy group and 90.6% in the nonpregnant group (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.24-0.77). In women with hormone receptor-positive cancer, we found similar results (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.2-0.91). In the ART analysis, there was no difference in survival between groups; the 5-year disease-specific survival rate was 96.9% in the ART group and 94.1% in the non-ART group (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.17-1.13).Pregnancy and ART are not associated with worse survival in women with breast cancer.We sought to determine the impact of pregnancy or assisted reproductive technologies (ART) among breast cancer survivors. We performed a study of 30,021 women by linking available data from California and the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology Clinic Outcome Reporting System. For each pregnant woman, we matched at the time of pregnancy comparable women who were not pregnant at that point but were otherwise similar based on observed characteristics. We repeated these analyses for women who received ART. We found that pregnancy and ART were not associated with worse survival.",
  "To compare abbreviated MRI with mammography and US for screening in women with a personal history of breast cancer. In addition, the first and subsequent rounds of abbreviated MRI were compared.The Institutional Review Board approved this retrospective study. Nine hundred and thirty-nine abbreviated MRI scans of 710 women with a personal history of breast cancer were included (mean age, 54.1\u00b19.4 years). The diagnostic performances of abbreviated MRI, mammography, and US for the detection of the second breast cancer were compared. When more than one round of abbreviated MRI was performed, we compared the scans of the first and subsequent rounds.There were 15 (2.1%) cases of second breast cancer. Thirty-nine of the 939 abbreviated MRI scans were diagnosed as positive; of them, 11 were diagnosed as breast cancer, with a PPV<sub>2</sub> of 28.2% (US, 19.0%; mammography, 28.6%). The AUC, sensitivity, and cancer detection rate (per 1000) were the highest for abbreviated MRI (0.829, 68.8% and 11.7) (US: 0.616, 25.0%, and 4.3; mammography: 0.560, 12.5%, and 2.1, respectively). Two hundred women underwent multiple rounds of abbreviated MRI. AUC, PPV<sub>2</sub>, and the cancer detection rates were higher during the subsequent rounds (0.987, 45.5, and 21.8) than during the first round (0.605, 11.1, and 5).Abbreviated MRI for women with a personal history of breast cancer was more sensitive for the diagnosis of second breast cancer than US or mammography. In addition, subsequent rounds of MRI showed better performance than the first round.",
  "Long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) Breast cancer anti-estrogen resistance 4 (BCAR4) has been shown to participate in the biological progress of various cancers including breast cancer. Genetic Polymorphisms in BCAR4 may have an influence on the progress of breast cancer, but it is rarely studied.In our epidemiology study, three tagging SNPs (rs4561483, rs11649623 and rs13334967) in lncRNA BCAR4 were selected for genotyping among 487 breast cancer cases and 489 healthy controls. And quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to evaluate the relative mRNA expression of BCAR4 in different genotypes of the significant locus rs13334967.We found that BCAR4 rs13334967 is associated with lower breast cancer risk both in codominant model (AT vs AA, OR 0.632, 95% CI 0.429-0.931, TT vs AA, OR 0.731, 95% CI 0.511-0.990) and dominant model (AT\u2009+\u2009TT vs AA, OR 0.798, 95% CI 0.571-0.970). The further results of qRT-PCR displayed that carriers with rs13334967 AT, TT genotype have lower BCAR4 mRNA expression compared with AA genotype.The research study implied that BCAR4 rs13334967 was correlated with the susceptibility to breast cancer and may impact the mRNA expression of BCAR4. LncRNA BCAR4 may be a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for breast cancer.",
  "To identify biologic and outcome differences between double hormone receptor (HR)-positive (dHR<sup>+</sup>, estrogen receptor (ER)<sup>+</sup>/progesterone receptor [PgR<sup>+</sup>]) and single HR-positive (sHR<sup>+</sup>, either ER<sup>+</sup>/PgR<sup>-</sup> or ER<sup>-</sup>/PgR<sup>+</sup>) breast cancer; and to explore whether hormone therapy (HT) response in HER2-negative breast cancer correlates with HR status.This retrospective study was conducted by using 2 large breast cancer databases: the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) clinical data set. Cox regression analysis was used to estimate overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) among sHR<sup>+</sup> and dHR<sup>+</sup> patients.In the SEER database, dHR<sup>+</sup> patients had significantly longer OS and BCSS than ER<sup>+</sup>/PgR<sup>-</sup> patients in short-term follow-up (OS: hazard ratio\u00a0= 0.620; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.590, 0.652; P\u00a0< .001; BCSS: hazard ratio\u00a0= 0.493; 95% CI, 0.462, 0.526; P\u00a0< .001). Meanwhile, ER<sup>-</sup>/PgR<sup>+</sup> patients had younger age, larger tumor size, and higher disease grade than dHR<sup>+</sup> and ER<sup>+</sup>/PgR<sup>-</sup> patients. In patients who received HT, dHR<sup>+</sup> patients had a more favorable OS than ER<sup>+</sup>/PgR<sup>-</sup> patients (hazard ratio\u00a0= 0.789; 95% CI, 0.635, 0.982; P\u00a0= .034), and ER<sup>-</sup>/PgR<sup>+</sup> patients had a worse OS than ER<sup>+</sup>/PgR<sup>-</sup> patients at 10 years' follow-up (hazard ratio\u00a0= 7.991; 95% CI, 1.053, 60.644; P\u00a0= .044). However, these groups had similar outcomes over longer periods.In HER2-negative breast cancer, sHR<sup>+</sup> patients are associated with relatively worse characteristics and worse short-term outcomes than dHR<sup>+</sup> patients. Additionally, the outcome of patients receiving HT may differ according to the HR status. However, further studies are needed to confirm these conclusions.",
  "Podoplanin expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) has been proposed as an indicator for poor prognosis in patients with invasive breast carcinomas, but little is known about its clinical significance in node-negative breast cancer patients with hormone receptor (HR)\u2009+\u2009/HER2 \u2009-\u2009subtype, who are expected to have a favorable prognosis.Immunohistochemical analyses were performed on 169 resected specimens of node-negative invasive carcinoma of no special type with HR\u2009+\u2009/HER2\u2009-\u2009subtype using antibodies for podoplanin. When more than 10% of CAFs showed immunoreactivity with podoplanin as strong as that of internal positive controls, the specimens were judged as podoplanin-positive.Podoplanin-positive status in CAFs was observed in 16.0% (27 of 169 cases) and it associated with high Ki67 labeling index (LI) (>\u200930%) (p\u2009=\u20090.03), higher stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and progesterone receptor-negative status (p\u2009=\u20090.045). Log-rank test showed that podoplanin-positive status in CAFs correlated with shorter disease-free survival (DFS) (p\u2009=\u20090.007) and disease-specific survival (DSS) (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Univariate analysis showed a significant correlation between shorter DFS and podoplanin-positive status in CAFs (hazard ratio [HR]\u2009=\u20093.380; p\u2009=\u20090.012), the presence of lymphatic invasion (HR\u2009=\u20095.621; p\u2009<\u20090.001), high Ki67 LI (HR\u2009=\u20095.217; p\u2009<\u20090.001), and histological grade III (HR\u2009=\u20093.748; p\u2009=\u20090.008). According to Cox multivariate analysis, podoplanin-positive status in CAFs had the most significant effect on shorter DSS (HR\u2009=\u200937.759; p\u2009=\u20090.003) followed by high Ki67LI (HR\u2009=\u200927.664; p\u2009=\u20090.007).Podoplanin expression in CAFs could be an independent predictor for poor prognosis in node-negative breast cancer patients with HR\u2009+\u2009/HER2\u2009-\u2009subtype.",
  "We aim to examine the characteristics and survival of patients with de novo metastatic breast cancer (dnMBC) and recurrent metastatic breast cancer (rMBC) in New Zealand.This study included women diagnosed with dnMBC and women who developed rMBC between 2010 and 2017. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to examine cancer-specific survival. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of cancer-specific mortality by ethnicity, age, year of diagnosis, socioeconomic deprivation, site of metastases, number of metastatic sites, biomarker subtype and MBC subgroup.We included 2177 MBC patients (667 dnMBC and 1510 rMBC). The median survival of dn MBC patients was 26\u00a0months compared to 18\u00a0months for rMBC. There were no differences in breast-cancer specific mortality by ethnicity or socioeconomic deprivation. The adjusted HR for patients with visceral metastases compared to patients with non-visceral metastases was 1.41, and the adjusted HR for triple negative disease compared to Luminal A disease was 2.24. Compared to dnMBC, the adjusted HRs for rMBC patients with a metastatic-free interval of\u2009<\u20092\u00a0years, 2-4\u00a0years, 5-7\u00a0year and 8\u2009+\u2009years were 1.81, 1.47, 1.08 and 0.82, respectively.The survival for patients with MBC in New Zealand is very similar to other developed countries. Patients with dnMBC had a much better prognosis than those with recurrent disease. Patients with triple negative disease or non-luminal HER2 positive disease had the worst prognosis. The prognosis for patient with rMBC improved the longer the time from diagnosis to the development of metastases.",
  "Inflammatory breast cancer is a deadly and aggressive type of breast cancer. A key challenge relates to the need for a more detailed, formal, objective definition of IBC, the lack of which compromises clinical care, hampers the conduct of clinical trials, and hinders the search for IBC-specific biomarkers and treatments because of the heterogeneity of patients considered to have IBC.Susan G. Komen, the Inflammatory Breast Cancer Research Foundation, and the Milburn Foundation convened patient advocates, clinicians, and researchers to review the state of IBC and to propose initiatives to advance the field. After literature review of the defining clinical, pathologic, and imaging characteristics of IBC, the experts developed a novel quantitative scoring system for diagnosis.The experts identified through consensus several \"defining characteristics\" of IBC, including factors related to timing of onset and specific symptoms. These reflect common pathophysiologic changes, sometimes detectable on biopsy in the form of dermal lymphovascular tumor emboli and often reflected in imaging findings. Based on the importance and extent of these characteristics, the experts developed a scoring scale that yields a continuous score from 0 to 48 and proposed cut-points for categorization that can be tested in subsequent validation studies.To move beyond subjective 'clinical diagnosis' of IBC, we propose a quantitative scoring system to define IBC, based on clinical, pathologic, and imaging features. This system is intended to predict outcome and biology, guide treatment decisions and inclusion in clinical trials, and increase diagnostic accuracy to aid basic research; future validation studies are necessary to evaluate its performance.",
  "Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer with a high fatality rate amongst women worldwide. Diagnosing at an early stage is challenging, and due to the limitations of the currently used techniques, including mammography and imaging diagnostics, it still remains unascertained. Serum biomarkers can be a solution for this as they can be isolated in a less painful, more cost-effective, and minimally invasive manner. In this study, we shed light on the relevant role of multiple microRNAs (miRNAs) as potential biomarkers in breast cancer diagnosis. We monitored the expressional changes of 15 pre-selected miRNAs in a large cohort, including 65 patients with breast cancer and 42 healthy individuals. We performed thorough statistical analyses on the cohort sample set and determined the diagnostic accuracy of individual and multiple miRNAs. Our study reveals a potential improvement in diagnostics by implicating the monitoring of miR-15a+miR-16+miR-221 expression in breast cancer management.",
  "Sarcopenia has emerged as an important parameter to predict outcomes and treatment toxicity. However, limited data are available to assess sarcopenia prevalence in metastatic breast cancer and to evaluate its management.The SCAN study was a cross-sectional multicenter French study that aimed to estimate sarcopenia prevalence in a real-life sample of metastatic cancer patients. Sarcopenia was identified by low muscle mass (estimated from the skeletal muscle index at the third lumbar, via computed tomography) and low muscle strength (defined by handgrip strength). Three populations were distinguished based on EWGSOP criteria: a sarcopenic group with low muscle mass AND strength, a pre-sarcopenic group with low muscle mass OR strength and a normal group with high muscle mass AND strength.Among 766 included patients, 139 patients with breast cancer and median age of 61.2 years (29.9-97.8 years) were evaluable; 29.5% were sarcopenic and 41.0% were pre-sarcopenic. Sarcopenic patients were older (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), had a worse PS-score (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and a higher number of metastatic sites (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), the majority being hepatic and bone. A moderate agreement between the oncologist's diagnosis and sarcopenia evaluation by muscle mass and strength was recognized (Cohen's kappa\u00a0=\u00a00.45). No associations were found between sarcopenia and adverse event occurrence in the 12 patients for whom these were reported. Sarcopenic patients were underdiagnosed and nutritional care and physical activity were less proposed.It is necessary to evaluate sarcopenia due to its impact on patient prognosis, and its utility in guiding patient management in metastatic breast cancer.",

Chemotherapy (CT) was prescribed in 28% of patients, hormonal therapy in 80.3%, monoclonal antibodies (MAb) in 86.8% of Luminal B Her2+ and 97.7% of HR- Her2+ patients.Median follow up was 72.43 (IQR: 44.63-104.13) months. The 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of local relapse-free survival (LRFS) was 97.8%, regional-(RRFS) 98.6%, loco-regional- (LRRFS) 96.9%, distant- (DRFS) 96.6%, disease-free survival (DFS) 94.8% and overall survival (OS) 95.5%. Considering molecular subtypes, 5-year LRFS was: 99.8% for Luminal A, 96.7% for Luminal B Her2-, 94.1% for Luminal B Her2+, 87.9% for HR- Her2+, 95.1% for TNBC and 99.1% for in situ carcinoma.While the overall estimated probability of LR within 5 years after WBHF-IMRT without boost is good (2.2%), molecular subtypes have a strong impact, despite MAb therapy in Her2+ patients, and CT for TNBC patients, and could be used as a parameter in deciding the boost prescription.",
  "Macrophages are important immune cells in the tumor microenvironment and can be divided into two polarized subtypes, M1 and M2. M1 type macrophages have anti-tumor effects, while M2 type macrophages have pro-tumor effect. Most of the current researches are limited to the effect of M1 or M2 macrophages on tumors, while ignoring the overall balance of macrophages. Our research suggests that the macrophage balance fraction (MBF) can more effectively and comprehensively reflect the balance of tumor associated macrophages. Using bioinformatics analysis and in vitro experiments, we found that MBF is also an effective indicator of the degree of immunosuppression and metastatic ability of breast cancer, and different MBF environment can impact the migration and invasion ability of breast cancer cells. Finally, we also found that the mechanism of MBF changes in breast cancer may be affected by breast cancer-derived exosomes. In summary, MBF was proposed and validated as a novel indicator of macrophage balance state. Using this indicator, we found that the balance of macrophages can affect the degree of immunosuppression and metastatic ability of breast cancer.",
  "To study the risk of incident breast cancer and subtype-specific breast cancer in relation to excess body weight in a contemporary Swedish prospective cohort study, The Karolinska Mammography Project for Risk Prediction of Breast Cancer, KARMA.A total of 35,412 postmenopausal women attending mammography and included in the KARMA study provided baseline data on body mass index (BMI) and potential confounders. During eight years of follow-up, 822 incident invasive breast cancer cases were identified.Women with overweight (BMI\u2009\u2265\u200925-<\u200930\u00a0kg/m<sup>2</sup>) constituting 34% of the study cohort had an increased risk of incident breast cancer with an adjusted Hazard Ratio (HR<sub>adj</sub>) 1.19 (95% CI 1.01-1.4). A similar, however, non-significant, association was found for women with obesity (BMI\u2009\u2265\u200930\u00a0kg/m<sup>2</sup>) conferring 13% of the cohort, with a HR<sub>adj</sub> of 1.19 (95% CI 0.94-1.5). Overweight was associated with risk of node-negative disease (HR<sub>adj</sub> 1.29, 95% CI 1.06-1.58), whereas obesity was associated with node-positive disease (HR<sub>adj</sub> 1.64, 95% CI 1.09-2.48). Both overweight and obesity were associated with risk of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) disease (HR<sub>adj</sub> 1.20, 95% CI 1.00-1.44 and HR<sub>adj</sub> 1.33, 95% CI 1.03-1.71, respectively), and low-grade tumors (HR<sub>adj</sub> 1.25, 95% CI 1.02-1.54, and HR<sub>adj</sub> 1.40, 95% CI 1.05-1.86, respectively). Finally, obesity was associated with ER+HER2 negative disease (HR<sub>adj</sub> 1.37, 95% CI 1.05-1.78) and similarly luminal A tumors (HR<sub>adj</sub> 1.43, 95% CI 1.02-2.01).Overweight and obesity are associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer, specifically ER+, low-grade, and for obesity, node-positive, high-risk breast cancer indicating a further need for risk communication and preventive programs.",
  "BRCA1/2 founder pathogenic variants (PVs) occur in various populations, but data on the mutational spectrum in Africans are limited. We examined BRCA1/2 PVs in breast cancer patients of Ethiopian Jewish (EJ) origin.We retrospectively analyzed BRCA1/2 test results and clinical features of EJ breast cancer patients from seven medical institutions. We obtained heterozygote carrier rates in affected individuals from the laboratories of the largest Israeli HMO (Clalit). Population carrier frequency was determined in EJ controls.We identified three recurrent BRCA2 PVs in 11 EJ breast cancer patients (9 females, 2 males): c.7579delG, c.5159C\u2009>\u2009A, and c.9693delA. Only c.5159C\u2009>\u2009A was previously reported in Africans. In women, mean age at diagnosis was 35.7y; 8/9 were diagnosed with advanced disease. All tumors were invasive, 4/9 were triple negative. Only 3/11 carriers had relevant family history. Carrier rate in high-risk breast cancer patients was 11% (3/28; 95%CI [2.3%, 28.2%]). Combined carrier rate among controls was 1.8% (5/280; 95%CI [0.6%, 4.1%]).EJs harbor 3 recurrent BRCA2 PVs presenting with relatively severe breast cancer morbidity. Combined with the high BRCA2 carrier rate in the EJ population, these findings merit increasing awareness in this community and suggest that a culturally adapted population screening approach may be warranted.",
  "Breast cancer is a common malignant tumor in women. In recent years, its incidence is increasing year by year, and its morbidity and mortality rank the first place among female malignant tumors. Some key enzymes and intermediates in glycolysis are closely related to tumor development. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) is an important rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis pathway. Meanwhile, it is highly expressed in proliferative cells, especially in tumor cells, and plays an important role in the formation of Warburg effect and tumorigenesis. Previous studies have explored the effects of PKM2 expression on the prognosis and clinical significance of breast cancer patients, while the results are contradictory and uncertain. This study uses controversial data for meta-analysis to accurately evaluate the problem. We collected relevant Oncomine and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data to further verify the results. Through bioinformatics analysis, the mechanism and related pathways of PKM2 in breast cancer are explored.We searched Wanfang, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, the Chongqing VIP Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases from inception to March 2021. The language restrictions are Chinese and English. The published literatures on PKM2 expression and prognosis or clinicopathological characteristics of breast cancer patients were statistically analyzed. Combined hazard ratios (HRs), odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to evaluate the effects of PKM2 on the prognosis and clinicopathological features of breast cancer. Stata 14.0 software was applied for meta-analysis. Oncomine and TCGA databases were used to meta-analyze the differences of PKM2 mRNA expression between breast cancer and normal breast tissues. The expression of PKM2 protein was verified by Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database. The relationship between the gene and the survival of breast cancer patients was analyzed by Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA). The relationship between PKM2 gene and clinicopathological characteristics was analyzed by using LinkedOmics, and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment pathway analysis was performed by using Metascape. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed by String website.The results of this meta-analysis will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication.This study provides high-quality medical evidence for the correlation between the expression of PKM2 and the prognosis and clinicopathological features of breast cancer. Through bioinformatics analysis, this study further deepens the understanding of the mechanism and related pathways of PKM2 in breast cancer.The private information from individuals will not be published. This systematic review also should not damage participants' rights. Ethical approval is not available. The results may be published in a peer-reviewed journal or disseminated in relevant conferences.DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/W52HB.",
  "To develop a breast cancer risk model to identify women at mammographic screening who are at higher risk of breast cancer within the general screening population.This retrospective nested case-control study used data from a population-based breast screening program (2009-2015). All women aged 40-75 diagnosed with screen-detected or interval breast cancer (n\u2009=\u20091882) were frequency-matched 3:1 on age and screen-year with women without screen-detected breast cancer (n\u2009=\u20095888). Image-derived risk factors from the screening mammogram (percent mammographic density [PMD], breast volume, age) were combined with core biopsy history, first-degree family history, and other clinical risk factors in risk models. Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Classifiers assigning women to low- versus high-risk deciles were derived from risk models. Agreement between classifiers was assessed using a weighted kappa.The AUC was 0.597 for a risk model including only image-derived risk factors. The successive addition of core biopsy and family history significantly improved performance (AUC\u2009=\u20090.660, p\u2009<\u20090.001 and AUC\u2009=\u20090.664, p\u2009=\u20090.04, respectively). Adding the three remaining risk factors did not further improve performance (AUC\u2009=\u20090.665, p\u2009=\u20090.45). There was almost perfect agreement (kappa\u2009=\u20090.97) between risk assessments based on a classifier derived from image-derived risk factors, core biopsy, and family history compared with those derived from a model including all available risk factors.Women in the general screening population can be risk-stratified at time of screen using a simple model based on age, PMD, breast volume, and biopsy and family history.\u2022 A breast cancer risk model based on three image-derived risk factors as well as core biopsy and first-degree family history can provide current risk estimates at time of screen. \u2022 Risk estimates generated from a combination of image-derived risk factors, core biopsy history, and first-degree family history may be more valid than risk estimates that rely on extensive self-reported risk factors. \u2022 A simple breast cancer risk model can avoid extensive clinical risk factor data collection.",
  "Evidence suggests that breast density and body mass index (BMI) are strong breast cancer risk factors; however, their interactive associations are unknown. Elucidation of these interactive associations may help to increase understanding of the causes of breast cancer and find effective interventions for susceptible subgroups.To explore the association of the interaction of mammographic breast density and BMI with breast cancer risks among premenopausal and postmenopausal women.This prospective observational cohort study used population-based data of the Korean National Cancer Screening Program embedded in the National Health Insurance Service database to evaluate the breast cancer risk of 3\u202f248\u202f941 premenopausal cancer-free women and 4\u202f373\u202f473 postmenopausal cancer-free women aged 40 years or older who underwent mammographic screening between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2013, and were followed up until December 31, 2018. Statistical analysis was performed from June 1 to July 15, 2021.Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)-defined breast density (with a scale from 1 to 4, where 1 indicates almost entirely fat, 2 indicates scattered fibroglandular densities, 3 indicates heterogeneously dense tissue, and 4 indicates extremely dense tissue) and BMI levels classified according to the World Health Organization Asia-Pacific Region classification.Adjusted relative risk (aRR) of breast cancer during the follow-up period and interactions in additive and multiplicative scales. The study end point was the development of breast cancer.Of 3\u202f248\u202f941 premenopausal women (mean [SD] age, 44.6 [4.3] years) and 4\u202f373\u202f473 postmenopausal women (mean [SD] age, 59.6 [8.4] years) aged 40 years or older, 34\u202f466 cases of breast cancer were identified among the premenopausal women, and 30\u202f816 cases of breast cancer were identified among the postmenopausal women. Increased breast density was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women across the BMI categories. Among premenopausal women, those in BI-RADS category 4 had an approximately 2-fold higher risk of breast cancer irrespective of BMI (all women: aRR, 2.36 [95% CI, 2.24-2.49]; underweight: aRR, 1.80 [95% CI, 1.25-2.59]; normal weight: aRR, 2.10 [95% CI, 1.93-2.28]; overweight: aRR, 2.47 [95% CI, 2.27-2.68]; obese: aRR, 2.87 [95% CI, 2.49-3.32]) than those with underweight status and in BI-RADS category 1. However, an association between BMI and the risk of breast cancer was found only in the postmenopausal women in all breast density categories compared with underweight women with BI-RADS category 1 (BI-RADS category 4, all women: aRR, 2.91 [95% CI, 2.78-3.04]; underweight: aRR, 2.74 [95% CI, 1.89-3.98]; normal weight: aRR, 3.05 [95% CI, 2.82-3.30]; overweight: aRR, 2.85 [95% CI, 2.67-3.04]; obese: aRR, 2.52 [95% CI, 2.22-2.88]). When the combined associations of breast density and BMI with the risk of breast cancer were considered, a high breast density and high BMI had a significant positive interaction on the additive scale for both premenopausal and postmenopausal women, especially the latter (premenopausal women: adjusted relative excess risk due to interaction, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.35-0.71]; postmenopausal women: adjusted relative excess risk due to interaction, 1.68 [95% CI, 1.26-2.10]).This study suggests that breast density and BMI interact synergistically to augment breast cancer risk, with a stronger association found among postmenopausal women. Both factors should be incorporated into risk stratification in a population-based screening for public health significance. Women with overweight or obesity and dense breast tissue might benefit from tailored early screening strategies to detect breast cancer.",
  "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been confirmed to play an essential role in modulating cancer cell proliferation, metastasis, and sensitivity to chemotherapy. However, the correlation between miR-132-3p expression and etoposide (VP16) induced apoptosis in human breast cancer cells remains poorly understood.Six datasets, including three gene expression profile datasets and three microRNA (miRNA) expression profile datasets, were downloaded from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to identify miR-132-3p and GSK3B expression in breast cancer. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank testing were performed to evaluate the effect of miR-132-3p and GSK3B on the survival of breast cancer. Flow cytometry analysis was used to determine the effects of miR-132-3p and GSK3B on breast cancer cell apoptosis. Luciferase reporter assay, Western blot, and real-time PCR were used to determine the regulatory effect of miR-132-3p on GSK3B.miR-132-3p was significantly downregulated in breast cancer tissues compared with normal breast epithelial cells, whereas GSK3B expression was remarkably over-expressed in breast cancer tissues. The patients with low miR-132-3p or high GSK3B expression had worse overall survival. Luciferase reporter assay, Western blot, and real-time PCR confirmed that miR-132-3p could inhibit GSK3B protein and mRNA expression via binding to the 3'-UTR of GSK3B. Furthermore, miR-132-3p enhanced VP16-induced breast cancer cell apoptosis through targeting GSK3B.Collectively, the results of this study indicated that miR-132-3p was downregulated in breast cancer tissues and directly targeted GSK3B to be implicated in the modulation of breast cancer cell apoptosis, suggesting that miR-132-3p/GSK3B might be a novel, effective therapeutic target for treating patients with breast cancer.",
  "Lymph node metastasis is more likely in early-stage breast cancer with lower tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) density. Therefore, we investigated the correlation between TILs and lymph node metastasis in cT1 breast cancer patients undergoing surgery and the usefulness of TILs in predicting sentinel lymph node metastasis (SLNM) in cT1N0M0 breast cancer.We investigated 332 breast cancer patients who underwent surgery as the first-line treatment after preoperative diagnosis of cT1. A positive diagnosis of SLNM as an indication for axillary clearance was defined as macrometastasis in the sentinel lymph node (SLN) (macrometastasis: tumor diameter\u2009>\u20092\u2009mm). Semi-quantitative evaluation of lymphocytes infiltrating the peritumoral stroma as TILs in primary tumor biopsy specimens prior to treatment was conducted.For SLN biopsy (SLNB), a median of 2 (range, 1-8) SLNs were pathologically evaluated. Sixty cases (19.4%) of SLNM (macrometastasis: 46, micrometastasis: 16) were observed. Metastasis was significantly greater in breast cancers with tumor diameter\u2009>\u200910\u2009mm than in those with diameter \u2264 10\u2009mm (p\u2009=\u20090.016). Metastasis was significantly associated with lymphatic invasion (p\u2009<\u20090.001). These two clinicopathological factors correlated with SLNM even in patients diagnosed with cN0 (tumor size; p\u2009=\u20090.017, lymphatic invasion; p\u2009=\u20090.002). Multivariate analysis for SLNM predictors revealed lymphatic invasion (p\u2009=\u20090.008, odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20092.522) and TILs (p\u2009<\u20090.001, OR\u2009=\u20090.137) as independent factors.Our results suggest a correlation between lymph node metastasis and tumor immune-microenvironment in cT1 breast cancer. TIL density may be a predictor of SLNM in breast cancer without lymph node metastasis on preoperative imaging.",
  "Adhesion-regulating molecule 1 (ADRM1) is a polyubiquitin receptor on the 26S proteasome. ADRM1 is upregulated in many cancers. In this study, we evaluated the potential prognostic and predictive value of ADRM1 in breast cancer.Individual and pooled survival analyses were performed on 19 independent breast cancer microarray datasets. Gene signatures enriched by ADRM1 were also analyzed in pooled datasets.Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that high expression of ADRM1 was significantly associated with aggressive breast cancer. Our findings revealed that ADRM1 mRNA levels were significantly associated with estrogen receptor (ER) status, progesterone receptor status, tumor size, lymph node status, histologic grade, and molecular subtypes. We also found that higher mRNA ADRM1 expression was significantly correlated with poor survival in patients with breast cancer. The prognostic power of ADRM1 mRNA was similar to the 70-gene wound response genes and 21 gene recurrence score; it was superior to TNM staging. The prognostic value of ADRM1 was better in ER-positive (ER<sup>+</sup>) breast cancer cases than in ER-negative breast cancer cases. In cases involving stage II breast cancer, radiotherapy significantly reduced the relative risk of OS in the ADRM1-low subgroup.ADRM1 mRNA levels were significantly related to poor outcome in our breast cancer sample population. It could serve as a prognostic biomarker, especially in ER<sup>+</sup> breast cancer and Luminal A breast cancer cases, as well as a predictive biomarker for ER<sup>+</sup> breast cancer.",
  "HER2-positive breast cancers are rare amongst BRCA mutation carriers. No data exist regarding clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of this subgroup of patients.Using a retrospective matched cohort design, we collected data from 700 women who were diagnosed with operable invasive breast cancer from January 2006 to December 2016 and were screened for germline BRCA mutations. Clinicopathological features and survival rates were analyzed by BRCA and HER2 status.One hundred and fifteen HER2-positive/BRCA mutated cases were evaluated in comparison to the three control groups: HER2-positive/BRCA wild type (n\u00a0=\u00a0129), HER2-negative/BRCA mutated (n\u00a0=\u00a0222), HER2-negative/BRCA wild type (n\u00a0=\u00a0234). HER2-positive breast cancers were more likely to have high histologic grade and high proliferation rate than HER2-negative neoplasms, regardless of BRCA mutation status. An interaction between BRCA mutations and HER2-positive status was found to correlate with worse survival after adjusting for prognostic variables (HR\u00a0=\u00a03.4; 95% CI: 1.3-16.7).Co-occurrence of BRCA mutations and HER2-positive status is a poor prognostic factor in patients with early or locally advanced breast cancer. This finding may be a proof of concept that a combined pharmacological intervention directed to these targets could be synergistic.",
  "The Prosigna-PAM50 risk of recurrence (ROR) score has documented clinical utility for the prediction of 10-year distant recurrence (DR). The present study investigated the value of Prosigna-PAM50 for predicting 10-year DR and overall survival after 5 years of endocrine treatment for postmenopausal patients with invasive lobular carcinoma.Using the Danish Breast Cancer Group database, we identified patients with a diagnosis from 2000 to 2003 of estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative invasive ductal (n\u00a0=\u00a01570) or lobular (n\u00a0= 341) cancer > 20\u00a0mm or 1 to 3 positive lymph nodes and applied multivariate Cox models.The median follow-up for DR was 9.3 years and for overall survival 15.2 years. Of the 341 lobular and 1570 ductal cases, 140 (41%) and 349 (22%) were classified as low ROR, with a 10-year DR rate of 7.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.7%-13.6%) and 3.5% (95% CI, 1.8%-6.2%), respectively. The 10-year DR rate for the intermediate ROR group for those with lobular cancer was 18% (95% CI, 10.1%-27.9%) compared with 9.7% (95% CI, 6.7%-13.4%) for those with ductal cancer. Luminal B tumors had a significantly worse outcome than luminal A tumors in both lobular (hazard ratio, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.03%-3.45%; P\u00a0= .04) and ductal (hazard ratio, 3.18; 95% CI, 2.29%-4.43%; P\u00a0< .0001) cancer.Prosigna PAM-50 provides significant prognostic information beyond the clinicopathologic factors in patients with invasive lobular breast cancer. Those with lobular cancer had worse 10-year DR rates compared with those with ductal cancer in the same ROR category. Our results could have an effect on the treatment decisions regarding the addition of chemotherapy for those in the intermediate ROR group.",
  "Mammographically-detected breast density impacts breast cancer risk and progression, and fibrillar collagen is a key component of breast density. However, physiologic factors influencing collagen production in the breast are poorly understood. In female rats, we analyzed gene expression of the most abundantly expressed mammary collagens and collagen-associated proteins across a pregnancy, lactation, and weaning cycle. We identified a triphasic pattern of collagen gene regulation and evidence for reproductive state-dependent composition. An initial phase of collagen deposition occurred during pregnancy, followed by an active phase of collagen suppression during lactation. The third phase of collagen regulation occurred during weaning-induced mammary gland involution, which was characterized by increased collagen deposition. Concomitant changes in collagen protein abundance were confirmed by Masson's trichrome staining, second harmonic generation (SHG) imaging, and mass spectrometry. We observed similar reproductive-state dependent collagen patterns in human breast tissue obtained from premenopausal women. SHG analysis also revealed structural variation in collagen across a reproductive cycle, with higher packing density and more collagen fibers arranged perpendicular to the mammary epithelium in the involuting rat mammary gland compared to nulliparous and lactating glands. Involution was also characterized by high expression of the collagen cross-linking enzyme lysyl oxidase, which was associated with increased levels of cross-linked collagen. Breast cancer relevance is suggested, as we found that breast cancer diagnosed in recently postpartum women displayed gene expression signatures consistent with increased collagen deposition and crosslinking compared to breast cancers diagnosed in age-matched nulliparous women. Using publicly available data sets, we found this involution-like, collagen gene signature correlated with poor progression-free survival in breast cancer patients overall and in younger women. In sum, these findings of physiologic collagen regulation in the normal mammary gland may provide insight into normal breast function, the etiology of breast density, and inform breast cancer risk and outcomes.",
  "Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has complex biological function, and is a candidate oncogene with a wide variety of deleterious functions in breast cancer. Here, we evaluated the relationship between expression of HO-1 protein with clinical response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer patients.We used immunohistochemistry (IHC) to determine expression of HO-1 protein from core needle biopsy before NAC, then applied univariate and multivariate analyses to understand the relationship between HO-1 with pathological complete response (pCR) outcomes. Next, Kaplan-Meier and Log-rank tests were used to compare disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), between groups, and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis applied for prognostic evaluation.A total of 575 patients with locally advanced invasive breast cancer were included in the study, of which 111 (19.3%) achieved pCR after NAC. Results from multivariate analysis showed that high HO-1 expression was an independent predictor of low pCR rate (OR 0.254, 95% CI 0.026-0.643, p\u2009=\u20090.002). Moreover, results from survival analysis showed that high HO-1 expression was significantly associated with shorter DFS (HR 4.843, 95% CI 1.205-32.572, p\u2009=\u20090.026), but not with OS (HR 3.219, 95% CI 0.928-32.124, p\u2009=\u20090.071). Furthermore, HO-1 expression was significantly associated with lower pCR rate (OR 0.102, 95% CI 0.013-0.352), p\u2009=\u20090.001), poor DFS (HR 8.562, 95% CI 1.592-34.950, p\u2009=\u20090.009), and OS (HR 7.835, 95% CI 1.220-56.213, p\u2009=\u20090.023) of patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients.Our results indicated that HO-1 expression is not only a biomarker for predicting pCR, but also a prognostic factor in breast cancer patients in a neoadjuvant setting, especially in TNBC subgroups.",
  "Adipose tissue secretes various peptides, including leptin. This hormone acts through the leptin receptor (Ob-R), which is expressed ubiquitously on the surface of various cells, including breast cancer cells and immune cells. Increasing evidence points to an interaction between the tumor microenvironment, tumor cells, and the immune system. Leptin plays an important role in breast cancer tumorigenesis and may be implicated in activation of the immune system. While breast cancer cannot be considered an immunogenic cancer, the triple-negative subtype is an exception. Specific immune cells - tumor infiltrating lymphocytes - are involved in the immune response and act as predictive and prognostic factors in certain breast cancer subtypes. The aim of this article is to review the interaction between adipose tissue, through the expression of leptin and its receptor, and the adaptive immune system in breast cancer.",
  "Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) is one of the most important causes of breast cancer metastasis and resistance against drugs. The cancer stem cells (CSCs) are known as essential factors for VM formation. In this study, the effects of melatonin, Apatinib, and a combination of Apatinib/melatonin on VM formation were investigated by breast CSCs from breast cancer cell line.The percentage of CSCs was determined in two breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) by flow cytometry. The effects of Apatinib, melatonin, and a combination of Apatinib/melatonin were evaluated on proliferation and viability, migration and invasion, apoptosis, and VM formation in MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, expression levels of the involved proteins in cancer cell proliferation and viability, CSCs, migration and invasion, and VM formation were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting methods.Results of the present study showed that melatonin and Apatinib reduced survival rate of CSCs in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Apatinib, melatonin, and a combination of Apatinib/melatonin inhibited proliferation of breast CSCs (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.001). Formation of VM was decreased in the MDA-MB-231 cancer cell line treated with Apatinib and combination of Apatinib/melatonin. Apatinib and combination of Apatinib/melatonin reduced invasion of breast CSCs (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.0001). Expression of vascular endothelial VE-cadherin, ephrinA2 receptor (EPHA2), p-PI3K/phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) and phospho-AKT (p-AKT)/AKT ratios was decreased under the influence of Apatinib and a combination of Apatinib/melatonin (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.01).Apatinib or a combination of Apatinib/melatonin may be used to manage patients with breast cancer. However, further studies are needed to identify anti-cancer mechanisms of melatonin and Apatinib for better management of the patients with breast cancer.",
  "Breast cancer is increasing around the globe, including Asia. We aimed to examine the survival and risk of contralateral breast cancer (CBC) in Asian breast cancer patients with BRCA mutations.A total of 128 breast cancer patients with germline BRCA mutations and 4,754 control breast cancer patients were enrolled. Data on clinical-pathologic characteristics, survival, and CBC were collected from the medical record. The rates of survival and CBC were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method.The mean age of onset in BRCA mutation carriers was significantly younger than control patients (BRCA vs. Non-BRCA: 43.9 vs. 53.2\u00a0years old). BRCA mutation carriers had a higher proportion of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (52%) than control patients (12%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). The risk of CBC was significantly higher in BRCA mutation patients than in control cases (hazard ratio (HR)\u2009=\u20093.95, 95% CI 2.71-5.75); when stratified by genotype, the HRs (95%CI) were 4.84 (3.00-7.82) for BRCA1 and 3.13 (1.78-5.49) for BRCA2 carriers, respectively. Moreover, BRCA1 mutation patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) as their first breast cancer had the highest risk of CBC (HR\u2009=\u20095.55, 95% CI 3.29-9.34). However, we did not observe any differences in relapse-free survival and overall survival between mutation carriers and control patients.Our study suggest that BRCA patients had a significantly higher risk of developing CBC, particularly for BRCA1 mutation carriers with TNBC as the first breast cancer.",
  "The Rho GTPase family consists of 20 genes encoding intracellular signalling proteins that influence cytoskeletal dynamics, cell migration and cell cycle progression. They are implicated in breast cancer progression but their role in breast cancer aetiology is unknown. As aberrant Rho GTPase activity could be associated with breast cancer, we aimed to determine the potential for a causal role of Rho GTPase gene expression in breast cancer risk, using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR). MR was undertaken in 122,977 breast cancer cases and 105,974 controls, including 69,501 estrogen receptor positive (ER+) cases and 105,974 controls, and 21,468 ER negative (ER-) cases and 105,974 controls. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) underlying expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) obtained from normal breast tissue, breast cancer tissue and blood were used as genetic instruments for Rho GTPase expression. As a sensitivity analysis, we undertook co-localisation to examine whether findings reflected shared causal variants or genomic confounding. We identified genetic instruments for 14 of the 20 human Rho GTPases. Using eQTLs obtained from normal breast tissue and normal blood, we identified evidence of a causal role of RHOD in overall and ER+\u2009breast cancers (overall breast cancer: odds ratio (OR) per standard deviation (SD) increase in expression level 1.06; (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03, 1.09; P\u2009=\u20095.65\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-5</sup>) and OR 1.22 (95% CI 1.11, 1.35; P\u2009=\u20095.22\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-5</sup>) in normal breast tissue and blood respectively). There was a consistent direction of association for ER- breast cancer, although the effect-estimate was imprecisely estimated. Using eQTLs from breast cancer tissue and normal blood there was some evidence that CDC42 was negatively associated with overall and ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancer risk. The evidence from colocalization analyses strongly supported our MR results particularly for RHOD. Our study suggests a potential causal role of increased RHOD gene expression, and, although the evidence is weaker, a potential protective role for CDC42 gene expression, in overall and ER+\u2009breast cancers. These finding warrant validation in independent samples and further biological investigation to assess whether they may be suitable targets for drug targeting.",
  "As abundant and heterogeneous stromal cells in tumor microenvironment, carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are critically involved in cancer progression.To identify co-expression module and hub genes of distinctive breast CAFs, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was conducted based on the expression array results of CAFs from seven chemo-sensitive breast cancer (BC) patients and seven chemo-resistant ones before neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.A total of 4916 genes were included in WGCNA, and 12 modules were determined. Module-trait assay showed that the blue module (cor\u2009=\u20090.97, P\u2009<\u20090.001) was associated with CAF-related chemo-resistance, which was enriched mainly as \"inflammatory response\", \"interferon-gamma-mediated signaling\" and \"NIK/NF-kappaB signaling\" pathways. Moreover, CXCL8, CXCL10, CXCL11, PLSCR1, RIPK2 and USP18 were found to be potentially associated with chemo-resistance related to CAFs and prognosis of BC.Our current data offered valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of distinctive breast CAFs, which was beneficial for revealing how chemo-resistance of BC was initiated.",
  "DNA methylation is a vital epigenetic change that regulates gene transcription and helps to keep the genome stable. The deregulation hallmark of human cancer is often defined by aberrant DNA methylation which is critical for tumor formation and controls the expression of several tumor-associated genes. In various cancers, methylation changes such as tumor suppressor gene hypermethylation and oncogene hypomethylation are critical in tumor occurrences, especially in breast cancer. Detecting DNA methylation-driven genes and understanding the molecular features of such genes could thus help to enhance our understanding of pathogenesis and molecular mechanisms of breast cancer, facilitating the development of precision medicine and drug discovery. In the present study, we retrospectively analyzed over one thousand breast cancer patients and established a robust prognostic signature based on DNA methylation-driven genes. Then, we calculated immune cells abundance in each patient and lower immune activity existed in high-risk patients. The expression of leukocyte antigen (HLA) family genes and immune checkpoints genes were consistent with the above results. In addition, more mutated genes were observed in the high-risk group. Furthermore, a <i>in silico</i> screening of druggable targets and compounds from CTRP and PRISM databases was performed, resulting in the identification of five target genes (HMMR, CCNB1, CDC25C, AURKA, and CENPE) and five agents (oligomycin A, panobinostat, (+)-JQ1, voxtalisib, and arcyriaflavin A), which might have therapeutic potential in treating high-risk breast cancer patients. Further <i>in vitro</i> evaluation confirmed that (+)-JQ1 had the best cancer cell selectivity and exerted its anti-breast cancer activity through CENPE. In conclusion, our study provided new insights into personalized prognostication and may inspire the integration of risk stratification and precision therapy.",
  "Breast cancer continues to be one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality globally and was the leading cause of cancer death in women in Spain in 2020. Early diagnosis is one of the most effective methods to lower the incidence and mortality rates of breast cancer. The human metalloproteinases (MMP) mainly function as proteolytic enzymes degrading the extracellular matrix and plays important roles in most steps of breast tumorigenesis. This retrospective cohort study shows the immunohistochemical expression levels of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-9 in 154 women with breast cancer and 42 women without tumor disease. The samples of breast tissue are assessed using several tissue matrices (TMA). The percentages of staining (\u226450%->50%) and intensity levels of staining (weak, moderate, or intense) are considered. The immunohistochemical expression of the MMP-1-intensity (<i>p</i> = 0.043) and MMP-3 percentage (<i>p</i> = 0.018) and intensity, (<i>p</i> = 0.025) present statistically significant associations with the variable group (control-case); therefore, expression in the tumor tissue samples of these MMPs may be related to the development of breast cancer. The relationships between these MMPs and some clinicopathological factors in breast cancer are also evaluated but no correlation is found. These results suggest the use of MMP-1 and MMP-3 as potential biomarkers of breast cancer diagnosis.",
  "To describe relevant pathological parameters of Danish male breast cancer patients (MBCP) diagnosed from 1980 to 2009, and to relate these data to treatment, overall survival (OS) and standardized mortality rate (SMR).The MBCP cohort was defined from national Danish registers. A total of 643 MBCP were identified with tissue available in 457. Among these, 384 were primary operable. Where tissue blocks were available, tumor type, grade, estrogen receptor (ER), progesteron receptor (PgR) and androgen-receptor (AR) status as well as HER 2 and Ki67 were performed. OS was quantified by Kaplan-Meier estimates and SMR was calculated based on mortality rate among patients relative to the mortality rate in the general population.Male breast cancer was more often of ductal type, grade II and a very high proportion were ER and AR positive and HER2 negative. Intrinsic subtypes based on immunohistochemical evaluation showed luminal subtype. Ki67 ratio increased over period of study. OS declined by increased age, bigger tumor size, positive lymph node status, higher grade and Luminal B subtype. Hazard ratio and relative risk of SMR were highest for patients aged\u2009<\u200960\u00a0years.Male breast cancer is of luminal subtype, but more often Luminal B. Ki67 is crucial in evaluation of subtypes by immunohistochemistry, but have limitations. Subtyping seems to be of major importance. AR also can have a role in future treatment.",
  "Hormonal therapy and radiotherapy are conducted concurrently or sequentially after breast cancer surgery. It remains unclear whether concurrent or sequential treatment is safer in terms of lung complications. Using a Japanese nationwide database, this study aimed to compare the occurrence of severe lung complications between concurrent and sequential treatments.We identified patients who underwent partial mastectomy for stage 0-III breast cancer from July 2010 to March 2020 and received adjuvant hormonal therapy and radiotherapy concurrently (n\u2009=\u20091851) or sequentially (n\u2009=\u200918,429). Two propensity score analyses (1:4 matching and overlap weighting) were conducted to compare hospitalization for radiation pneumonitis and pneumonia within 1\u00a0year after surgery, and intensive care unit admission and mortality during the hospitalization. We conducted additional analyses stratified by hormonal drugs (aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen).The propensity score-matched analysis showed no significant differences in occurrence of hospitalization for radiation pneumonitis (0.27 vs. 0.58%, p\u2009=\u20090.10) and pneumonia (0.16 vs. 0.58%, p\u2009=\u20090.05) between the concurrent and sequential treatments. The overlap propensity score-weighted analysis also showed no significant differences (0.25 vs. 0.56%, p\u2009=\u20090.08 and 0.15 vs. 0.44%, p\u2009=\u20090.06, respectively). Intensive care unit admission and in-hospital mortality did not differ significantly between the two treatments. The stratified analysis showed similar results.Our propensity score analyses revealed no significant differences in severe lung complications between concurrent and sequential hormonal therapy with radiotherapy following breast cancer surgery, regardless of the type of hormonal drugs. Clinicians can provide concurrent or sequential treatment with equivalent attention to early lung complications.",
  "The aim of this study was to compare the survival rates of Korean females aged 40 to 49 years with breast cancer detected by supplemental screening ultrasound (US) or screening mammography alone.This single-institution retrospective study included 240 patients with breast cancer (mean age, 45.1 \u00b1 2.8 years) detected by US or mammography who had undergone breast surgery between 2003 and 2008. Medical records were reviewed for clinicopathologic characteristics and detection methods. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between patients with breast cancer in the US and mammography groups using the log-rank test. Multivariable cox regression analysis was used to identify independent variables associated with DFS and OS.Among the 240 cases of breast cancer, 43 were detected by supplemental screening US and 197 by screening mammography (mean follow-up: 7.4 years, 93.3% with dense breasts). There were 19 recurrences and 16 deaths, all occurring in the mammography group. While the US group did not differ from the mammography group in tumor stage, the patients in this group were more likely to undergo breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy than the mammography group. The US group also showed better DFS (<i>p</i> = 0.016); however, OS did not differ between the two groups (<i>p</i> = 0.058). In the multivariable analysis, the US group showed a lower risk of recurrence (hazard ratio, 0.097; 95% confidence interval, 0.001-0.705) compared to the mammography group.Our study found that Korean females aged 40-49 years with US-detected breast cancer showed better DFS than those with mammography-detected breast cancer. However, there were no statistically significant differences in OS.",
  "To estimate the long term risk of distant metastases (DM) for women with initial diagnoses of non-metastatic breast cancer; to estimate breast cancer-specific and overall survival for women with DM.Population-based health record linkage study.Women diagnosed with localised or regional primary breast cancer recorded in the NSW Cancer Registry, 2001-2002.Time from breast cancer diagnosis to first DM, time from first DM to death from breast cancer.time to death from any cause.6338 women were diagnosed with non-metastatic breast cancer (localised, 3885; regional, 2453; median age, 59 years [IQR, 49-69 years]). DM were recorded (to 30 September 2016) for 1432 women (23%; median age, 62 years [IQR, 51-73 years]). The 14-year cumulative DM incidence was 22.2% (95% CI, 21.1-23.2%; localised disease: 14.3% [95% CI, 13.2-15.4%]; regional disease: 34.7% [95% CI, 32.8-36.6%]). Annual hazard of DM was highest during the second year after breast cancer diagnosis (localised disease: 2.8%; 95% CI, 2.3-3.3%; regional disease: 9.1%; 95% CI, 7.8-10.3%); from year five it was about 1% for those with localised disease, from year seven about 2% for women with regional disease at diagnosis. Five years after diagnosis, the 5-year conditional probability of DM was 4.4% (95% CI, 3.7-5.1%) for women with localised and 10.4% (95% CI, 9.1-12.0%) for those with regional disease at diagnosis. Median breast cancer-specific survival from first DM record date was 28 months (95% CI, 25-31 months); the annual hazard of breast cancer death after the first DM record declined from 36% (95% CI, 33-40%) during the first year to 14% (95% CI, 11-18%) during the fourth year since detection.DM risk declines with time from diagnosis of non-metastatic breast cancer, and the annual risk of dying from breast cancer declines with time from initial DM detection. These findings can be used to inform patients at follow-up about changes in risk over time since diagnosis and for planning health services.",
  "Identifying women at risk for advanced interval cancers would allow better targeting of mammography and supplemental screening. The authors assessed risk factors for advanced breast cancer within 2 years of a negative mammogram.The authors included 293,520 negative mammograms performed from 2006 to 2015 among 74,736 women. Breast cancers were defined as advanced if they were >2 cm, were >1 cm and triple-negative or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive, had positive lymph nodes, or were metastatic. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to evaluate associations of age, breast density, menopause, mammogram type, prior breast biopsy, body mass index (BMI), and a family history of breast cancer with a cancer diagnosis within 2 years of a negative mammogram. Models were stratified by year since a negative mammogram.Among 1345 breast cancers, 357 were advanced (26.5%), and 988 (73.5%) were at an early stage. Breast density, prior biopsy, and family history were associated with an increased risk of both advanced and early-stage cancers. Overweight and obese women had a 40% higher risk of early-stage cancer only in year 2 (overweight hazard ratio [HR], 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19-1.67; P < .001; obese HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.17-1.70; P < .001). Obese women had a 90% increased risk of advanced cancer in year 1 (HR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.14-3.18; P = .014), and both overweight and obese women had a 40% or greater increased risk in year 2 (overweight HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.14-2.07; P = .005; obese HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.00-2.01; P = .051).A higher BMI was associated with an advanced breast cancer diagnosis within 2 years of a negative mammogram. These results have important implications for risk assessment, screening intervals, and use of supplemental screening.",
  "Brain metastasis (BM) is a dreadful complication that significantly impacts the quality of life in breast cancer patients. A key process during brain metastasis is the migration of cancer cells across blood-brain barrier (BBB). However, the role of snoRNAs regulating BBB in BM is still unknown.Here SNORic and GEO databases were used to identify differentially expressed snoRNAs between brain metastatic and non-metastatic breast cancer (BC) tissues. The effects of SNORA71B on the capacities of proliferation, migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and BBB invasion of BC cells were evaluated by CCK8, transwell, western blot, and BBB model, respectively.SNORA71B was highly expressed in high BM BC tissues and cells compared to low BM BC controls. Survival analysis revealed high expression of SNORA71B was significantly associated with poor PPS and OS in breast cancer patients. ROC curve showed that SNORA71B might act as biomarker for breast cancer. Moreover, SNORA71B significantly promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion of BC cells with different BM abilities. Importantly, SNORA71B promoted the EMT process of low BM BC cells. SNORA71B knockdown inhibited the high BM BC cells across BBB, while EMT activator dramatically abrogated this inhibited effect.In conclusion, SNORA71B promotes BC cells across the BBB partly via inducing EMT.",
  "Standard chemotherapy for early breast cancer consists generally of an anthracycline - taxane - based regimen, preferably in sequence. Anthracyclines are among the most active cytotoxic drugs against breast cancer. Nevertheless, benefits attained by the use of the more potent anthracycline schedules must be balanced against increased short - and long - term toxicity, and treatment options must be individualized for each patient. Authors review available data regarding anthracycline efficacy and toxicity in the early breast cancer setting and the potential directions for future research.",
  "We performed a retrospective study on the efficacy and safety of sirolimus (an mTOR inhibitor) in hormone receptor (HR)-positive advanced breast cancer and searched for biomarkers to predict its efficacy.All patients with HR-positive metastatic breast cancer treated with sirolimus plus endocrine therapy between December 2017 and July 2018\u00a0at the Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences were consecutively and retrospectively reviewed. Mutations in circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) were assayed for 1021 tumour-related genes via gene panel target capture-based next-generation sequencing.Thirty-six patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with sirolimus plus endocrine therapy were included. The progression-free survival (PFS) rates between the sirolimus group and everolimus group were similar, and the median PFS was 4.9 months and 5.5 months, respectively (hazard ratio 1.56, 95% CI 0.86-2.81, P\u00a0=\u00a00.142). The objective response rate in the 36 patients was 19.4%, and the clinical benefit rate was 41.7%. Lipid metabolism disorder was the most common adverse event (69.4%), and 13.9% of patients had stomatitis. Most (94.4%) adverse events were grade 1-2. Twenty patients (55.6%) underwent ctDNA analysis before receiving sirolimus therapy. For patients who received less than 3 lines of chemotherapy, those with PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway alterations had a better response to sirolimus than those without alterations, with a median PFS of 7.0 months vs 4.3 months (hazard ratio\u00a0=\u00a00.01, 95% CI 0.00-0.34, P\u00a0=\u00a00.010).Sirolimus is a potentially effective treatment option for patients with HR-positive advanced breast cancer.",
  "Obesity increases the risk for breast cancer and is associated with poor outcomes for cancer patients. A variety of rodent models have been used to investigate these relationships; however, key differences in experimental approaches, as well as unique aspects of rodent physiology lead to variability in how these valuable models are implemented. We combine expertise in the development and implementation of preclinical models of obesity and breast cancer to disseminate effective practices for studies that integrate these fields. In this review, we share, based on our experience, key considerations for model selection, highlighting important technical nuances and tips for use of preclinical models in studies that integrate obesity with breast cancer risk and progression. We describe relevant mouse and rat paradigms, specifically highlighting differences in breast tumor subtypes, estrogen production, and strategies to manipulate hormone levels. We also outline options for diet composition and housing environments to promote obesity in female rodents. While we have applied our experience to understanding obesity-associated breast cancer, the experimental variables we incorporate have relevance to multiple fields that investigate women's health.",
  "Due to the lack of clinical trials on the efficacy of chemotherapy in older patients, an optimal treatment strategy has not been developed. We investigated whether adjuvant chemotherapy could improve the survival of older patients with breast cancer in Japan.We retrospectively analyzed data of patients with breast cancer aged\u2009\u2265\u200970\u00a0years who underwent breast cancer surgery in eight hospitals between 2008 and 2013. Clinical treatment and follow-up data were obtained from the patients' medical electric records.A total of 1095 patients were enrolled, of which 905 were included in the initial non-matched analysis. The median age and follow-up period were 75 (range 70-93) and 6.3\u00a0years, respectively. Of these patients, 127 (14%) received adjuvant chemotherapy (Chemo group) while the remaining 778 (86%) did not (Control group). The Chemo group was younger (mean age in years 73 vs 76; P\u2009<\u20090.0001), had a larger pathological tumor size (mean mm 25.9 vs 19.9; P\u2009<\u20090.0001), and more metastatic axillary lymph nodes (mean numbers 2.7 vs 0.7; P\u2009<\u20090.0001) than the Control group. The disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) did not differ significantly between the two groups (P\u2009=\u20090.783 and P\u2009=\u20090.558). After matched analyses, DFS was found to be significantly prolonged with adjuvant chemotherapy (P\u2009=\u20090.037); however, OS difference in the matched cohort was not statistically significant (P\u2009=\u20090.333).The results showed that adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a reduced risk of recurrence, but survival benefits were limited.",
  "Little evidence exists regarding the clinical value of synbiotics in the management of post-treatment complications of breast cancer especially breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL). This study aimed to investigate the effects of synbiotic supplementation along with calorie restriction on quality of life and edema volume in patients with BCRL.This randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial was conducted on 135 overweight and obese women with BCRL aged 18-65 years old. Participants were randomly allocated to receive a calorie-restricted diet plus 10<sup>9</sup>\u00a0CFU synbiotic supplement (CRS group; n\u00a0=\u00a045) or placebo (CRP group; n\u00a0=\u00a045), daily for 10 weeks. Also, a control group (n\u00a0=\u00a045) with no intervention was included in the trial. All of the participants received Complete Decongestive Therapy for lymphedema treatment. The quality of life score, edema volume and body mass index (BMI) were measured at baseline and end of the trial.A total of 121 subjects completed the trial. CRS group showed a significant decrease in the total quality of life score (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004), and it's psychosocial (P\u00a0=\u00a00.022) and functional (P\u00a0=\u00a00.002) domain scores, as well as edema volume (P\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and BMI (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in comparison to the control. However, there were no significant differences in changes in trial outcomes between the CRS and CRP groups.Synbiotic supplementation along with a low-calorie diet was effective in quality of life, edema volume, and BMI improvement; mostly due to low-calorie diet. It seems that adding a dietitian consultation on the lymphedema management strategy may provide a better result in lymphedema control.",
  "To describe stage I-III breast cancer (BC) molecular subtypes and outcomes among a cohort of patients from Brazil.AMAZONA study is a retrospective cohort conducted from June 2008 to January 2009 including women of at least 18 years old, with histologically proven breast cancer, diagnosed in 2001 (n\u202f=\u202f2198) and 2006 (n\u202f=\u202f2714). In this analysis, we included patients who underwent surgery, had stage I-III disease and available pathological information (n\u202f=\u202f2296). We estimated molecular subtypes by local immunohistochemical stains. Data was obtained from medical charts and public databases.Mean age at diagnosis was 54 years and 41.1% were younger than 50 years. 23.3% were diagnosed in stage I, 53.5% in stage II and 23.2% in stage III. 80.8% were treated in the public health system. 71.3% had hormonal receptor positive disease, 15.7% were HER-2 positive and 21.1% had triple-negative breast cancer. 55.6% were treated with mastectomy and 96.2% received adjuvant treatment (82.2% chemotherapy). 13.4% of HER-2 positive patients received adjuvant trastuzumab. Overall survival rate at 5 years was 96.84% for stage I, 94.16% for stage II and 70.48% for stage III. Molecular subtypes were independent prognostic factor in stages II and III patients.Brazilian women have a higher risk of being diagnosed with late stage breast cancer and younger age than in high-income countries. Luminal-like disease is the most common molecular subtype in the country. Triple negative and HER-2 positive had the worst prognosis.",
  "Expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in breast cancer defines a subset of patients (\u223c15%-20%) who are candidates for anti-HER2 therapies, most notably, trastuzumab, pertuzumab, antibody drug conjugates (eg, T-DM1), and tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) drugs (eg, lapatinib and neratinib), all of which have dramatically changed the prognosis for this aggressive subtype of breast cancer. A roundtable meeting of the Breast Cancer Therapy Expert Group (BCTEG) was convened in March 2018 in an effort to discuss and clarify, from the perspective of the practicing community oncologist, recent developments in the diagnosis and treatment of HER2-positive (HER2<sup>+</sup>) breast cancer. Members of the group selected 4 key topics for discussion prior to the meeting, including diagnosis of HER2<sup>+</sup> disease, and its treatment in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and metastatic settings. Approved testing methods, such as immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization, are used to demonstrate overexpression and/or amplification of HER2 in breast tumors, and established clinical guidelines are used to appropriately define treatment plans for patients with HER2<sup>+</sup> disease. The panel acknowledges a range of treatment options now available for treatment of HER2<sup>+</sup> breast cancer in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and advanced/metastatic settings, although it is noted that many controversies remain, including the optimal sequence of therapies, the most appropriate treatment(s) for subsets of patients with HER2<sup>+</sup> disease (eg, hormone receptor-negative or -positive/HER2<sup>+</sup>), and uncertainties surrounding the diagnosis and definition of HER2<sup>+</sup> disease. The current report summarizes the discussion of the BCTEG panel on this topic.",
  "The background parenchymal enhancement at breast magnetic resonance imaging use to predict breast cancer attracts many searchers to draw a possible relationship. However, the results of their relationships were conflicting. This meta-analysis was performed to assess breast cancer frequency associations with background parenchymal enhancement.A systematic literature search up to January 2020 was performed to detect studies recording associations between breast cancer frequency and background parenchymal enhancement. We found thirteen studies including 13,788 women at the start with 4046 breast cancer. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between breast cancer frequency and background parenchymal enhancement by the dichotomous technique with a random or fixed-effect model.Women with minimal or mild background parenchymal enhancement at breast magnetic resonance imaging did not have any risk of breast cancer compared to control women (OR, 1.20; 95% CI 0.54-2.67). However, high background parenchymal enhancement at breast magnetic resonance imaging (OR, 2.66; 95% CI 1.36-5.19) and moderate (OR, 2.51; 95% CI 1.49-4.21) was associated with a significantly higher rate of breast cancer frequency compared to control women.Our meta-analysis showed that the women with high and moderate background parenchymal enhancement at breast magnetic resonance imaging have higher risks, up to 2.66 fold, of breast cancer. We suggest that women with high or moderate background parenchymal enhancement at breast magnetic resonance imaging to be scheduled for more frequent follow-up and screening for breast cancer to avoid any complications.",
  "Fatigue or tiredness is one of the most commonly reported symptoms in breast cancer patients treated with radiation therapy (RT). This study aimed to identify characteristics associated with fatigue in breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant RT.Patients with non-metastatic breast cancer receiving RT at the Odette Cancer Centre from 2011 to 2017 were included in our study if they completed at least one ESAS pre- and post-RT. Information regarding patient, disease and treatment characteristics was retrieved from chart review. To identify variables associated with fatigue scores pre-RT, post-RT and changes in fatigue scores, a univariate and multivariate general linear regression analysis was conducted; p\u202f<\u202f0.05 was considered statistically significant.Our study included 1223 female patients (mean age 59 years old) who completed ESAS on average 28 days before, and 142 days after RT. In multivariate analysis, higher baseline fatigue scores were found in women with higher disease stages (p\u202f=\u202f0.001), and those who receive locoregional radiation (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). No variables were significantly associated with post-RT fatigue scores. While adjuvant chemotherapy and locoregional RT were associated with higher baseline scores in univariate analysis, in multivariate analysis, they were associated with significant reduction in fatigue post-RT (p\u202f=\u202f0.01, p\u202f=\u202f0.007 respectively).Fatigue is associated with higher disease stage and receipt of locoregional radiation. While the relationship between anxiety or depressive symptoms and fatigue is well-established, a major gap exists in our understanding of its etiology and treatment; further investigation to address this can better improve patient quality of life.",
  "More than half of early breast cancer recurrences occur after 5 years from the initial diagnosis. An individualized estimate of the risk of late-period breast cancer-specific death (LP-BCSD) after 5 years of endocrine therapy (ET) can improve decision-making for extended endocrine therapy (EET).A total of 147,059 eligible patients with breast cancer who survived 5+ years after diagnosis between 1990 and 2007 were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Univariate and multivariate analyses based on the competing risk regression model were used to evaluate predictive factors for high risk of LP-BCSD or late-period non-breast cancer-specific death (LP-non-BCSD). Significant factors were used to build a nomogram to individualize estimates of LP-BCSD or LP-non-BCSD.The 5- and 10-year LP-BCSD rates were 5.7% and 10.1%, respectively, and the 5- and 10-year LP-non-BCSD rates were 6.7% and 15.5%, respectively. Young age, black race, single marital status, poor differentiation, large tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and estrogen receptor-positive/progesterone receptor-negative (ER+/PR-) status were independent predictive factors for high risk of LP-BCSD. Age was the most important factor for predicting high risk of LP-non-BCSD. The nomograms, which were based on significant factors identified by the competing risk regression model. A risk score system based on the competing risk nomogram was established to describe the relative risk of LP-BCSD and LP-non-BCSD.This study explored the novel endpoint of LP-BCSD for further clinical trials. The risk score system might be highly useful for patient counseling, especially in discussing EET options with elderly or comorbid patients.",
  "Breast cancer has become a dangerous killer for the female, which seriously threatened women's life, leading to huge pressures to society. The present study assessed the mechanism underlying the involvement of bone marrow tyrosine kinase on chromosome X (BMX) in breast cancer development.The expression of BMX was examined by qPCR and immunohistochemistry. The effect of BMX on cell proliferation and migration was detected by Clone formation assay and Transwell assay. In vitro study, the correlation of BMX with Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway was explored by western blot and TOP/FOP flash assay.In the present study, we found that BMX was up-regulated in breast cancer, which was associated with the tumor differentiation and TNM stage. Oncogenic BMX enhanced the ability of breast cancer cell proliferation and migration. Furthermore, BMX could up-regulate the protein expression levels of p-\u03b2-catenin (Y142), p-\u03b2-catenin(Y654) and inhibit the expression level of p-\u03b2-catenin (S33/37), thus activating Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, we revealed that BMX promoted GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation, which suppressed the degradation of \u03b2-catenin.In this study, we identified that BMX-activated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, playing an oncogenic role in breast cancer, suggesting that BMX could become a potential treatment target of breast cancer.",
  "African ancestry (AA) and obesity are associated with worse survival in early-stage breast cancer. Obesity disproportionately affects women of AA; however, the intersection between ancestry and obesity on breast cancer outcomes remains unclear.A total of 2854 patients in the adjuvant trial E5103 were analyzed. Genetic ancestry was determined using principal components from a genome-wide array. The impact of continuous or binary body mass index (BMI) on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) was evaluated by multivariable Cox proportional hazards models in AA patients and European ancestry (EA) patients.There were 2471 EA patients and 383 AA patients. Higher BMI was significantly associated with worse DFS and OS only in AA patients (DFS hazard ratio [HR], 1.25; 95% CI, 1.07-1.46; OS HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.10-1.73), not in EA patients (DFS HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.90-1.05; OS HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.93-1.14). Severe obesity (BMI \u226540) was significantly associated with worse survival in AA patients (DFS HR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.21-3.43; OS HR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.03-4.75) but had no impact on that of EA patients. In the estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and triple-negative breast cancer subgroups, BMI was significantly associated with worse outcomes only in those AA patients with ER+ disease. Within the AA group, BMI remained associated with worse survival regardless of the AA proportion.Higher BMI was statistically significantly associated with worse breast cancer outcomes in AA but not EA patients. This association was most significant for severe obesity and those with ER+ disease. These observations help define optimal populations for weight change interventions designed to affect disparities and survival in early-stage breast cancer.African ancestry and obesity are both risk factors for worse survival after early-stage breast cancer. Women of African descent are also disproportionately affected by obesity; however, it is unclear what impact body weight has on racial disparities in breast cancer. Data from a large phase 3 clinical trial in high-risk, early-stage breast cancer were used to determine how body weight affects survival outcomes in European versus African Americans. Study results demonstrate that a higher body mass index is associated with increased risk of breast cancer recurrence and worse survival in women of African ancestry but not in women of European ancestry.",
  "Bisphosphonates and denosumab, as adjuvant therapy in breast cancer, have been associated in some studies with improved cancer outcomes. The potential benefits of these drugs used at the lower doses commonly given for osteoporosis have not been established. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between therapy with bone-modifying agents (BMAs) and survival in older women with early breast cancer.The authors conducted a retrospective cohort study of women aged \u226566 years with breast cancer who were included in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results and Texas Cancer Registry Medicare-linked databases. Associations were examined between the receipt of BMAs at dosages indicated for osteoporosis within 2 years after diagnosis and overall and breast cancer-specific survival. Cox proportional hazards models and propensity score adjustment and matching were used for the analyses.Of the 37,724 women included, 7925 (21%) received at least 6 months of a BMA within the first 2 years of breast cancer diagnosis, including bisphosphonates only in 6898 women (80.7%), denosumab only in 1204 (15.2%), and both classes of BMAs in 323 (4.1%). The median follow-up was 64 months. The receipt of a bisphosphonate was associated with improved overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% CI, 0.82-0.93) and breast cancer-specific survival (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.64-0.92) after multivariable adjustment. Benefits were primarily seen for patients who had stage II and III disease. No benefits were observed with denosumab (stage II: HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.90-1.22]; stage III: HR, 1.09 [95% CI, 0.66-1.82]).Bisphosphonates at the doses recommended for osteoporosis are associated with improved survival in older postmenopausal women with early breast cancer.",
  "Although cannabinoids have been used for centuries for diverse pathological conditions, recently, their clinical interest and application have emerged due to their diverse pharmacological properties. Indeed, it is well established that cannabinoids exert important actions on multiple sclerosis, epilepsy and pain relief. Regarding cancer, cannabinoids were first introduced to manage chemotherapy-related side effects, though several studies demonstrated that they could modulate the proliferation and death of different cancer cells, as well as angiogenesis, making them attractive agents for cancer treatment. In relation to breast cancer, it has been suggested that estrogen receptor-negative (ER<sup>-</sup>) cells are more sensitive to cannabinoids than estrogen receptor-positive (ER<sup>+</sup>) cells. In fact, most of the studies regarding their effects on breast tumors have been conducted on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Nonetheless, the number of studies on human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2<sup>+</sup>) and ER<sup>+</sup> breast tumors has been rising in recent years. However, besides the optimistic results obtained thus far, there is still a long way to go to fully understand the role of these molecules. This review intends to help clarify the clinical potential of cannabinoids for each breast cancer subtype.",
  "Metaplastic breast cancer (MpBC) is a rare but aggressive type of breast cancer accounting for 0.25-1% of all diagnosed invasive breast cancers. Morphologically, it is characterized by differentiation of the neoplastic epithelium into squamous cells and/or mesenchymal-looking tissue.We analyzed 13 MpBCs selected from the group of 1122 invasive breast cancers. Histopathological examination and analysis of estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR) and HER2 receptors expression in MpBC patients and their comparison to other types of invasive breast cancer has been performed.13 MpBC cases represented 1.16% of the 1122 invasive breast cancers. The MpBC group presented with a significantly larger tumor size (\u2265T2, 69% versus 49%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and with higher grade of histological malignancy (G1-G3) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). MpBC group had significantly more cases with no hormone receptors (ER, PR) and HER2 overexpression/gene amplification compared with the other invasive breast cancer types group (ER-, 69% versus 23%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; PR-, 69% versus 28%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; HER2 0/1+, 93% versus 82%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.019). Most MpBCs (62%) were triple-negative. We found a correlation between hormone receptors expression and lymph node metastasis (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The analysis of the HER2 expression allowed us to find correlation between its expression and tumor histological grade (G1-G3) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), tumor size (T1a-T4) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and lymph node metastasis (pN0-pN4) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in MpBCs.MpBCs are usually larger at primary diagnosis and most of MpBCs present with other poor prognostic indicators and show lack of steroid hormone receptors expression as well as HER2. Hormone receptor status and HER2 expression seems to correlate with histological grade of malignancy (G1-G3), tumor size (T1a-T4) and regional lymph node involvement (pN0-pN4) and these features are directly related to MpBC malignancy.",
  "The role of HCK expression in the prognosis of breast cancer patients is unclear. Thus, this study aimed to explore the clinical implications of HCK expression in breast cancer. We assessed <i>HCK</i> expression and genetic variations in breast cancer using Oncomine, GEPIA, UALCAN, and cBioPortal databases. Then, immunochemistry was used to analyze HCK expression in breast cancer specimens, non-cancer tissues and metastatic cancer tissues. Consequently, we evaluated the effect of HCK expression on survival outcomes set as disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Finally, STRING, Coexpedia, and TISIDB database were explored to identify the molecular functions and regulation pathways of HCK. We found that breast cancer tissues have more <i>HCK</i> mRNA transcripts than non-cancer tissues. Patients with HCK expression had significantly shorter DFS and OS. The ratio of HCK expression was higher in cancer tissues than in non-cancer tissues. These results from STRING database, FunRich software, and TISIDB database showed that HCK was involved in mediating multiple biological processes including immune response-regulating signaling pathway, cell growth and maintenance through multiple signaling pathways including epithelial to mesenchymal transition, PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and focal adhesion. Overall, <i>HCK</i> may be an oncogene in the development of breast cancer and thus may as a novel biomarker and therapeutic target for breast cancer.",
  "To determine prevalence, clinicopathological characteristics, initial treatments, and outcomes associated with low estrogen receptor (ER)-expressing invasive breast cancer.This retrospective, non-interventional database study included patients undergoing surgery with curative intent for invasive ductal or lobular breast cancer. Patients were treated between January 2003-December 2012. Demographics, clinicopathological characteristics, initial treatments, and outcomes were abstracted from patient records. Patients were categorized using immunohistochemistry to determine ER, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) levels. ER-positive patients were subclassified as ER-low (1% to 10%) and ER-high (>\u200910%) according to the Allred Proportion Score. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared among groups by log-rank test.5930 patients were included (median follow-up, 80.9\u00a0months). Of all patients included, 117 (2.0%) had ER-low tumors: 63 (53.8%) of whom had HER2- tumors and 54 (46.2%) HER2+ tumors. Five-year DFS and OS were highest in the ER-high/HER2- cohort (94.0% and 98.6%, respectively) and lowest in the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC; 81.3% and 90.1%) and ER-low/HER2- (85.7% and 92.1%) cohorts. Menopausal status, elevated Ki-67, higher nuclear grade, higher tumor stage, presence of lymphovascular invasion, greater regional lymph node involvement, and larger tumor size were all potential prognostic factors for shorter DFS and OS.Patients with ER-low/HER2- breast cancer had similar clinicopathological characteristics, treatments, and outcomes as patients with TNBC irrespective of disease setting. Further research is needed to understand predictive and prognostic factors associated with ER-low/HER2- disease.",
  "We examined the characteristics of breast cancer patients with oligometastases (OM) treated with stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) to identify factors associated with local progression, distant metastasis progression, time to subsequent therapy, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).We retrospectively reviewed a single-institution database of patients treated with radiotherapy between 2008 and 2018 and identified 79 patients who received SABR to OM. Twenty-seven patients had genetic testing of metastatic tumors using an institutional targeted sequencing platform. Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cox regression, and competing risk models were used to compare clinical and genetic correlates with outcomes.Median follow-up was 50\u00a0months (IQR: 29-66) with 67% of patients alive at the last follow-up. Of the 65% of patients who progressed, 82% progressed outside of the radiation field, 18% experienced local failure, and 80% had oligoprogression. Median OS was 86\u00a0months (IQR: 29-66), and PFS was 33\u00a0months (IQR: 10-38). Less than 5\u00a0years from diagnosis to SABR and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) were associated with worse OS. Advanced T stage, any prior chemotherapy, and TNBC were associated with worse PFS. Alterations in CEBPB, RB1, TBX3, PTEN, and CDK4 were associated with worse survival outcomes.Long-term systemic disease control and survival can be achieved with SABR for oligometastatic breast cancer. Hormone receptor-positive patients with a long disease interval from initial diagnosis and limited systemic progression history may be ideal for SABR to all sites of disease.",
  "Many studies have found evidence of socioeconomic differences in breast cancer survival. This study aimed to quantify the impact of removing differences in stage distribution and stage-specific relative survival between education groups in Swedish women with breast cancer. Using information from a breast cancer research database, the study population contained 62\u202f121 women diagnosed with breast cancer in three healthcare regions of Sweden from 1992 to 2012. The loss in expectation of life and life years lost due to breast cancer were estimated using flexible parametric relative survival models by education group and age at diagnosis. The potential gain in life years and postponable deaths were calculated by applying the 1) stage distribution, 2) stage-specific relative survival, and 3) both stage distribution and stage-specific relative survival of the high education group to the low and medium education groups. For a cohort of around 3500 women diagnosed with breast cancer residing in three Swedish healthcare regions in a typical calendar year, we estimated that removing stage differences would postpone an additional 25 deaths at five years after diagnosis, and result in a gain of approximately 573 life years. Alternatively, if stage-specific breast cancer survival could be equated, approximately 692 life years could be saved and an additional 26 deaths could be postponed five years after diagnosis. Results such as these can help guide decisions on interventions intended to minimise socioeconomic differences in breast cancer outcomes.",
  "There is an increasing interest in HER2-low breast cancer with promising data from clinical trials using novel anti-HER2 antibody-drug conjugates. We explored the differences in clinicopathological characteristics and survival outcomes between HER2-low and HER2-IHC 0 breast cancer.Using nationwide data from the Korean Breast Cancer Registry between 2006 and 2011, 30,491 patients with stages I to III breast cancer were included in the analysis: 9,506 (31.2%) in the HER2-low group and 20,985 (68.8%) in the HER2-IHC 0 group. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression survival analysis were used to compare breast cancer-specific survival between the two groups.HER2-low breast cancer was more frequent in patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer than in those with triple-negative breast cancer. In patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, HER2-low breast cancer was associated with fewer T4 tumors, higher histological grade, and a negative lymphatic invasion. In patients with triple-negative breast cancer, HER2-low breast cancer was associated with a high lymph node ratio and positive lymphatic invasion. HER2-low breast cancer was significantly associated with a lower Ki-67 labeling index. No significant difference was observed in overall survival between the two groups. HER2-low breast cancer showed significantly better breast cancer-specific survival than HER2-IHC 0 breast cancer, regardless of the hormone receptor status. In multivariate analysis, the impact of low HER2 expression on breast cancer-specific survival was significant only in triple-negative breast cancer (HRs, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.93; P\u2009=\u20090.019).These findings suggest that the biology and clinical impact of low HER2 expression can differ according to the hormone receptor status and support the need for further investigation on the understanding of the biology of HER2-low breast cancer.",
  "The epidemiologic evidence from observational studies on breast cancer risk and phthalates, endocrine disrupting chemicals, has been inconsistent. In the only previous study based on pre-diagnostic urinary phthalates and risk of breast cancer, results were null in mostly white women.We examined the association between pre-diagnostic urinary phthalates and breast cancer in a nested case-control study within the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) study, presenting the first data from five major racial/ethnic groups in the USA. We measured 10 phthalate metabolites and phthalic acid, using a sensitive liquid chromatography mass spectrometry assay on 1032 women with breast cancer (48 African Americans, 77 Latinos, 155 Native Hawaiians, 478 Japanese Americans, and 274 Whites) and 1030 matched controls. Conditional logistic regression was used to examine risk with individual metabolites and ratios of primary (MEHP, mono-2-ethylhexyl-phthalate) to secondary (MEHHP, mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl); MEOHP, mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexy)) metabolites of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), a widely used plasticizer. In addition, we investigated risk associations with high (\u2211HMWP) and low molecular weight (\u2211LMWP) phthalates, as well as total phthalates which included high and low molecular weight phthalates with phthalic acid (\u2211LMHMPA) or without phthalic acid in molar ratios (\u2211LMHM<sub>molar</sub>) and adjusted for creatinine and potential confounders.Among all women, breast cancer risk was higher for those in tertile 2 and tertile 3 of primary to secondary metabolites of DEHP (MEHP/(MEHHP + MEOHP)) in comparison to those in tertile 1; the respective odds ratios were 1.32 (95% CI 1.04-1.68) and 1.26 (95% CI 0.96-1.66) (P<sub>trend</sub>\u00a0=\u20090.05). Risk among Native Hawaiian women increased with exposures to eight of ten individual phthalates and total phthalates (\u2211LMHMPA OR<sub>T3 vs T1</sub>\u00a0=\u20092.66, 95% CI 1.39-5.12, P<sub>trend</sub>\u00a0=\u20090.001). In analysis by hormone receptor (HR) status, exposure above the median of \u2211LMWP was associated with an increased risk of HR-positive breast cancer (OR\u2009=\u20091.30, 95% CI 1.05-1.60) while above the median exposure to phthalic acid was associated with an increased risk of HR-negative breast cancer (OR<sub>above vs below median</sub>\u00a0=\u20091.59, 95% CI 1.01-2.48).Further investigations of suggestive associations of elevated breast cancer risk with higher ratios of primary to secondary metabolites of DEHP, and differences in risk patterns by race/ethnicity and HR status are warranted.",
  "Genetic and non-genetic factors contribute to breast cancer development. An epigenome-based signature capturing these components in easily accessible samples could identify women at risk. Here, we analyse the DNA methylome in 2,818 cervical, 357 and 227 matched buccal and blood samples respectively, and 42 breast tissue samples from women with and without breast cancer. Utilising cervical liquid-based cytology samples, we develop the DNA methylation-based Women's risk IDentification for Breast Cancer index (WID-BC-index) that identifies women with breast cancer with an AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operator Characteristic) of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.80-0.88) and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.76-0.86) in internal and external validation sets, respectively. CpGs at progesterone receptor binding sites hypomethylated in normal breast tissue of women with breast cancer or in BRCA mutation carriers are also hypomethylated in cervical samples of women with poor prognostic breast cancer. Our data indicate that a systemic epigenetic programming defect is highly prevalent in women who develop breast cancer. Further studies validating the WID-BC-index may enable clinical implementation for monitoring breast cancer risk.",
  "<b>BACKGROUND</b>. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are associated with therapeutic outcomes and prognosis in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. Identification of TIL levels is clinically relevant. <b>OBJECTIVE</b>. The purpose of our study was to explore associations of clinicopathologic and MRI features with TIL levels in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. <b>METHODS</b>. A total of 212 consecutive women (mean age, 54.0 years) diagnosed with HER2-positive breast cancer between January 2017 and December 2019 were included in this retrospective study. Patients were divided into low-TIL (< 10%) and high-TIL (\u2265 10%) groups. Three breast radiologists independently reviewed images; interreader agreement was assessed, and the first reader's findings were used for further analysis. Associations of clinicopathologic and MRI features with TIL levels were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Subanalysis of TIL levels by hormone receptor (HR) status was also performed. <b>RESULTS</b>. A total of 115 (54.2%) patients had low TIL levels, and 97 (45.8%) patients had high TIL levels. A high TIL level was associated (all, <i>p</i> < .05) with histologic grade 3 (odds ratio [OR] = 3.98; frequency, 78.4% vs 52.2% in high- vs low-TIL groups, respectively), high tumor cellularity (OR = 4.59; median cellularity, 60% vs 50%), lower frequency of associated ductal carcinoma in situ (OR = 0.16; frequency, 86.6% vs 94.8%), and higher frequency of peritumoral edema on T2-weighted images (OR = 2.83; 71.1% vs 50.4%). In subgroup analysis by HR status, histologic grade 3 (OR = 5.03, <i>p</i> = .002) was a significant independent predictor of high TIL level in the HR-positive/HER2-positive group, whereas high tumor cellularity (OR = 9.06, <i>p</i> = .002), peritumoral edema (OR = 5.23, <i>p</i> = .03), and low ADC (OR = 11.69, <i>p</i> = .047) were independent predictors of high TIL level in the HR-negative/HER2-positive group. Interreader agreement for peritumoral edema was moderate among the three radiologists (\u043a = 0.432-0.539). <b>CONCLUSION</b>. Peritumoral edema on MRI and the histopathologic feature of tumor aggressiveness help predict high TIL levels in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. <b>CLINICAL IMPACT</b>. Pretreatment MRI features may serve as a useful tool for assessing TIL levels in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer and for helping to classify patients with variable clinical outcomes related to immune activity and to guide selection among neoadjuvant chemotherapy or HER2-targeted therapy or immunotherapy.",
  "Immune cells are present in normal breast tissue and in breast carcinoma. The nature and distribution of the immune cell subtypes in these tissues are reviewed to promote a better understanding of their important role in breast cancer prevention and treatment. We conducted a review of the literature to define the type, location, distribution, and role of immune cells in normal breast tissue and in in situ and invasive breast cancer. Immune cells in normal breast tissue are located predominantly within the epithelial component in breast ductal lobules. Immune cell subtypes representing innate immunity (NK, CD68<sup>+</sup>, and CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells) and adaptive immunity (most commonly CD8<sup>+</sup>, but CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD20<sup>+</sup> as well) are present; CD8<sup>+</sup> cells are the most common subtype and are primarily effector memory cells. Immune cells may recognize neoantigens and endogenous and exogenous ligands and may serve in chronic inflammation and immunosurveillance. Progression to breast cancer is characterized by increased immune cell infiltrates in tumor parenchyma and stroma, including CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> granzyme B<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells, B cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in breast cancer may serve as prognostic indicators for response to chemotherapy and for survival. Experimental strategies of adoptive transfer of breast tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte may allow regression of metastatic breast cancer and encourage development of innovative T-cell strategies for the immunotherapy of breast cancer. In conclusion, immune cells in breast tissues play an important role throughout breast carcinogenesis. An understanding of these roles has important implications for the prevention and the treatment of breast cancer.",
  "Splicing factor 3b subunit 1 (SF3B1) was frequently reported to be significantly mutated in breast cancer. However, the status of SF3B1 expression, its function and molecular consequence in breast cancer remained unreported.Immunohistochemistry was used to assess SF3B1expression in 110 breast cancer samples. SF3B1 knock\u2011down in ZR-75-30 and MDA-MB-231 cells was performed by shRNA transfection. The expression of SF3B1 in cells was detected by quantitative real\u2011time PCR and western blot. Cell proliferation ability was determined by MTT and colony formation assay. Migration and invasion were determined by transwell assay. Flow cytometry was performed to investigate cell cycle and apoptosis. RNA-sequencing was performed to examine differentially expressed genes and affected alternative splicing events.SF3B1 is overexpressed in breast cancer tissues compared with normal tissues. Overexpression of SF3B1 is associated with lymph node metastasis. SF3B1 knockdown in MDA-MB-231 and ZR-75-30 breast cancer cells significantly induced the suppression of proliferation, migration, invasion and also enhancement of apoptosis. RNA-sequencing data revealed that 860 genes were significantly up-regulated and 776 genes were significantly down-regulated upon SF3B1 knockdown. Differentially expressed genes enriched in the signaling pathways including Ras signaling pathway; cytokine receptor interaction; tight junction; MAPK signaling pathway, Glycine, serine and threonine metabolism. Alternative splicing analysis revealed that exon skipping (SKIP) and cassette exons (MSKIP) were the most common molecular effect upon SF3B1 knockdown.Our study suggests that SF3B1 may be an important molecular target for breast cancer treatment and provides a new clue for clinical treatment of breast cancer.",
  "Bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins are epigenetic molecules that regulate the expression of multiple genes involved in carcinogenesis. Breast cancer is an heterogenous disease emerging from aberrant gene expression and epigenetic alteration patterns. Amplification or overexpression of BET proteins has been identified in breast tumors highlighting their clinical significance. Development of BET inhibitors that disrupt BET protein binding to acetylated lysine residues of chromatin and suppress transcription of various oncogenes has shown promising results in breast cancer cells and xenograft models. Currently, Phase I/II clinical trials explore safety and efficacy of BET inhibitors in solid tumors and breast cancer. Treatment-emergent toxicities have been reported, including thrombocytopenia and gastrointestinal disorders. Preliminary results demonstrated greater response rates to BET inhibitors in combination with already approved anticancer agents. Consistently, BET inhibition sensitized breast tumors to chemotherapy drugs, hormone therapy and PI3K inhibitors in\u00a0vitro. This article aims to review all existing preclinical and clinical evidence regarding BET inhibitors in breast cancer.",
  "Thyroid autoimmunity might be in relation to other autoimmune endocrine disease or non-endocrine disorders and there are innate and adaptive immune cells in breast cancer. Because autoimmune factors are common characteristics of both thyroid autoimmunity and breast cancer, these two types of diseases may occur concurrently in certain patients. The chief goal of this meta-analysis is to perform a combined analysis of the raw data from all\u00a0included studies, and thereby obtain a reliable conclusion concerning whether TgAb or TPOAb positivity and breast cancer are indeed correlated.To determine whether a correlation exists between TgAb or TPOAb positivity and breast cancer, this study performed a review of the literature that began by searching for articles in Chinese or English from the Medline, Embase, Web of Science core, Wanfang, Weipu and SinoMed databases, published during the time span extending from January 1980 to December 2017. On the basis of these raw data, we calculated odds ratio (OR) values, 95% confidence interval (CI) values, and P values.A total of 11 studies were included in this study. By combining the raw data from the retrieved studies, we were able to perform a meta-analysis. The results of this meta-analysis support the hypothesis that patients with breast cancer have a higher TgAb or TPOAb positive rate than the non-breast disease control group (TgAb: OR\u2009=\u20092.71, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.81-4.05, P\u2009<\u20090.001; TPOAb: OR\u2009=\u20092.86, 95% CI\u2009=\u20092.17-3.77, P\u2009<\u20090.001, respectively). Testing for publication bias indicated that no significant publication bias was present in this meta-analysis, and sensitivity analysis indicated that the results of analysis were stable and reliable.The results of this meta-analysis suggest strongly that, the TgAb or TPOAb positive rate among patients with breast cancer should be higher than among the non-breast disease control group.",
  "To investigate the feasibility of simultaneous multi-slice readout-segmented diffusion-weighted echo-planar imaging (SMS rs-EPI DWI) in predicting invasive breast cancer molecular subtypes using whole-tumor histogram and texture analyses.In our retrospective study, 125 patients (mean age, 52.81\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.01\u00a0years; range, 24-84\u00a0years) with single invasive breast cancer who underwent preoperative MRI with SMS rs-EPI DWI and surgery at our institution were included. Two radiologists independently performed whole-tumor histogram and texture analyses on the apparentdiffusioncoefficient (ADC) map of SMS rs-EPI DWI (TR, 3800.0\u00a0ms; TE 90.0\u00a0ms; field of view, 340\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0206\u00a0mm; in-plane matrix, 244\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0148; section thickness, 5\u00a0mm; readout segments, 5, b\u00a0=\u00a00, 800\u00a0s/mm<sup>2</sup>; scan time, 3\u00a0mins; slice acceleration factor, 2). The Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis test were used to compare histogram and texture parameters to assess their potential in differentiating molecular subtypes of breast cancer and predicting axillary lymph node status. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated for parameters with significant differences, and the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated.Compared to luminal A breast cancer, the HER2-positive breast cancer subtype showed higher ADC<sub>_95th percentile</sub> values (p\u00a0=\u00a00.016). In addition, HER2-positive breast cancer yielded significantly higher ADC<sub>_mean</sub> (p\u00a0=\u00a00.025), ADC<sub>_median</sub> (p\u00a0=\u00a00.025), and ADC<sub>_5th percentile</sub> (p\u00a0=\u00a00.041) values than luminal B breast cancer. The ADC<sub>_skewness</sub> value was higher for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) than Luminal A breast cancer (p\u00a0=\u00a00.021). The difference in ADC<sub>_mean</sub>, ADC<sub>_median</sub>, ADC<sub>_5th percentile</sub> and ADC<sub>_95th percentile</sub> values between the HER2-positive breast cancer and luminal types was statistically significant, with a combined AUC for these parameters of 0.762 (sensitivity 72.41%, specificity 75.00%, PPV 27.27 %, and NPV 95.45 %). The ADC<sub>_skewness</sub> value for TNBC was higher than for luminal types (p\u00a0=\u00a00.012) and yielded an AUC value of 0.688 (sensitivity 96.15%, specificity 36.78%, PPV 31.25%, and NPV 96.97 %). Additionally, significantly higher ADC<sub>_skewness</sub> and ADC<sub>_95th percentile</sub> values (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003, 0.002, respectively) were reported for non-luminal types than luminal types yielding a combined AUC value of 0.712 (sensitivity 92.11%, and specificity 50.23%, PPV 41.18%, and NPV 92.50%). The AUC value for ADC<sub>_5th percentile</sub> for axillary lymph node status prediction was 0.659 (sensitivity 65.38%, specificity of 64.86%).The whole-tumor histogram and texture analyses parameters based on SMS rs-EPI DWI may provide biological information on aggressive molecular subtypes of breast cancer. In addition, ADC<sub>_5th percentile</sub> values were significantly different between lymph node-positive and lymph node-negative breast cancer.",
  "Early-adulthood body size is strongly inversely associated with risk of premenopausal breast cancer. It is unclear whether subsequent changes in weight affect risk. We pooled individual-level data from 17 prospective studies to investigate the association of weight change with premenopausal breast cancer risk, considering strata of initial weight, timing of weight change, other breast cancer risk factors and breast cancer subtype. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained using Cox regression. Among 628,463 women, 10,886 were diagnosed with breast cancer before menopause. Models adjusted for initial weight at ages 18-24\u2009years and other breast cancer risk factors showed that weight gain from ages 18-24 to 35-44 or to 45-54\u2009years was inversely associated with breast cancer overall (e.g., HR per 5 kg to ages 45-54: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.95-0.98) and with oestrogen-receptor(ER)-positive breast cancer (HR per 5 kg to ages 45-54: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.94-0.98). Weight gain from ages 25-34 was inversely associated with ER-positive breast cancer only and weight gain from ages 35-44 was not associated with risk. None of these weight gains were associated with ER-negative breast cancer. Weight loss was not consistently associated with overall or ER-specific risk after adjusting for initial weight. Weight increase from early-adulthood to ages 45-54\u2009years is associated with a reduced premenopausal breast cancer risk independently of early-adulthood weight. Biological explanations are needed to account for these two separate factors.",
  "The proliferation marker Ki67 has prognostic and predictive values in breast cancer, and the cutoff of the Ki67 label index (LI) is a key index for chemotherapy. However, poor interobserver consistency in Ki67 assessment has limited the clinical use of Ki67, especially in luminal cancers. Here, we reported a modified Ki67 assessment method, size-set semiautomatic counting (SSSAC) and investigated its interobserver reproducibility.One hundred invasive breast cancer tissues were set immunostained for Ki67 in one laboratory, scanned as digital slides, and sent to 41 pathologists at the laboratories of 16 hospitals for Ki67 LI assessment using size-set semiautomatic counting (SSSAC), size-set visual assessment (SSVA) and size-set digital image analysis (SSDIA) with a specific image viewing software (Aperio Image Scope, Leica, Germany). The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman plot were used to evaluate interobserver reproducibility. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to analyze the difference in the Ki67 values assessed by SSSAC and SSDIA.SSSAC demonstrated better interobserver reproducibility (ICC\u00a0=\u00a00.942) than SSVA (ICC\u00a0=\u00a00.802). The interobserver reproducibility was better in Ki67 homogeneously stained slides and centralized hot-spot slides than in scattered hot-spot slides. The Ki67 value assessed with SSSAC was obviously higher than that assessed with SSDIA (negative ranks (SSDIA\u00a0<\u00a0SSSAC): N\u00a0=\u00a080, sum of ranks\u00a0=\u00a04274.50; positive ranks (SSDIA\u00a0>\u00a0SSSAC): N\u00a0=\u00a017, sum of ranks\u00a0=\u00a0478.50; Z\u00a0=\u00a0-6.837; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).SSSAC shows satisfactory interobserver reproducibility in the Ki67 assessment of breast cancer and may be a candidate standard method for Ki67 LI assessment in breast cancer and other malignancies.",
  "Despite great advances in the treatment of breast cancer, innovative approaches are still needed to reduce metastasis. As a minimally invasive local therapy (not standard therapy for breast cancer), microwave ablation (MWA) has been attempted to treat breast cancer, but the local effect and immune response induced by MWA have seldom been reported.The clinical study was performed to determine the complete ablation rate of MWA for early-stage breast cancer. Secondary endpoints included safety and antitumor immune response. 35 subjects from this clinical study were enrolled in the current report, and the local effect was determined by pathological examinations or follow-up. To investigate MWA-induced immune response, patients treated with surgery (n=13) were enrolled as control, and blood samples were collected before and after MWA or surgery. The immune cell populations, serum cytokines, secretory immune checkpoint molecules, and T-cell receptor sequencing were analyzed.Of 35 enrolled patients, 32 (91.4%) showed complete ablation. Compared with surgery, MWA induced significantly increased levels of inducible co-stimulator (ICOS)+ activated\u2009CD4+ T cells and serum interferon gamma, indicating a shift in the Th1/Th2 balance toward Th1. The activated ICOS pathway was involved in the MWA-induced adaptive immune response. T-cell receptor sequencing revealed MWA of primary tumor activated T lymphocytes expansion and recognized some cancer-specific antigens. Moreover, CD4+ effector memory T-cell response was induced by MWA, and the immune response still existed after surgical resection of the ablated tumor.MWA may not only be a promising local therapy but also a trigger of antitumor immunity for breast cancer, opening new avenues for the treatment of breast cancer. Combinatorial strategy using additional agents which boost MWA-induced immune response could be considered as potential treatment for clinical study for early breast cancer therapy.",
  "To use mammographic tumour features (imaging biomarkers) to classify breast cancer according to its apparent anatomic site of origin in the new era where tumours are found at their nonpalpable, earliest detectable phase.Large format, subgross, three-dimensional histopathologic images of breast cancer subtypes and their corresponding imaging biomarkers were correlated with large format thin section histopathology and long-term patient outcome.This systematic correlation indicates that breast cancers arise from three separate fibroglandular tissue components: the terminal ductal lobular units (TDLUs), the major lactiferous ducts, and in the stem cells of the mesenchyme. The resulting three cancer subgroups have distinctly different clinical, histopathological and mammographic presentations and different long-term outcomes. The relative frequency of these three breast cancer subgroups is approximately 75%, 20% and 5%, respectively. Classification of breast cancers according to their anatomic site of origin, as demonstrated with breast imaging and confirmed by subgross histopathology, correlates closely with the long-term patient outcome.Classification of breast cancers according to their site of origin helps overcome the inconsistencies in the current histopathologic terminology with its ductal-lobular dichotomy. The ability of the imaging biomarkers to determine the site of tumour origin and serve as a prognostic indicator emphasizes the increasingly crucial role of breast imaging in the management of breast cancer. Basing breast cancer management upon anatomically relevant terminology challenges the conventional mindset. Our proposals are based on research results from an unprecedented number of prospectively collected nonpalpable breast cancers diagnosed at their earliest detectable phases and followed up for several decades. This article is a general introduction to a series of forthcoming articles describing in detail the breast malignancies originating from the three sites of origin.",
  "Emerging studies examined the association between sedentary behavior and risk of breast cancer, however, the dose-response relationship remained unclear. We aim to explore dose-response relationship of sedentary behavior and breast cancer risk\u00a0based on relevant cohort studies.Online database (PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE and Cochrane Library) were searched up to March 29, 2019. Overall relative risk\u00a0(RR) with 95% confidence interval\u00a0(CI) were pooled, and generalized least squares (GLS) method and restricted cubic splines were applied to evaluate the linear or nonlinear relation. Attributable risk proportion (ARP) was used to assess the health hazards of sedentary behavior in different countries.Eight prospective studies were included in the meta-analysis, containing 17 048 breast cancer cases and 426 506 participants. The borderline statistical association was detected between prolonged sedentary behavior and risk of breast cancer (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.99-1.19). Linear association between sedentary and breast cancer was observed (P<sub>nonlinearity</sub>\u2009=\u20090.262), and for 1\u00a0h/d increment of sedentary behavior, there was 1% increase of breast cancer risk (RR 1.01, 95% CI1.00-1.02). Similar results were also found between TV viewing and risk of breast cancer (P<sub>nonlinearity</sub>\u2009=\u20090.551), with 1\u00a0h/day increment of TV viewing daily attributing to 2% increase of breast cancer risk (RR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00-1.04). Moreover, sedentary behavior may statistically increase the risk of breast cancer by 21.6% for Asian countries, 8.26% for North America.Sedentary behavior was validated as a risk factor of breast cancer through dose-response analysis, especially TV viewing.",
  "To find immune-related genes with prognostic value in breast cancer, and construct a prognostic risk assessment model to make a more accurate assessment. Moreover, looking for potential immune markers for breast cancer immunotherapy.The breast cancer (BC) data were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database as a training set. Through the Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis, lasso regression analysis and stepwise backward Cox regression analysis, screening for prognosis-related immune genes, a prognostic index was built, and external validation with two data sets of Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was performed. Transcription factor (TF) regulatory network was constructed to identify key transcription factors that regulate prognostic immune genes. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to explore the signal pathways differences between high and low-risk groups, estimate package and TIMER database were used to evaluate the relationship between risk score and tumor immune microenvironment.We obtained 10 prognosis-related immune genes, and the index showed accurate prognostic value. We also identified 7 prognostic transcription factors. Multiple signaling pathways that inhibit tumor progression were enriched in the low-risk group, and risk score was significantly negatively related to the degree of immune infiltration and the expression level of immune checkpoint genes.We successfully constructed an independent prognostic index, which not only has a stronger predictive ability than the tumor pathological stage, but also can reflect the immune infiltration of breast cancer patients.",
  "Breast cancer has a high incidence and increasing mortality in Southern Brazil. The present study evaluated clinical and sociodemographic characteristics, and their association with overall survival in a private cancer center.1113 breast cancer patients were included in this study. The association between survival and clinicopathological and sociodemographic characteristics was analyzed using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meyer curves.Median age at diagnosis was 52 years (SD 13.5). Most patients were diagnosed in stages 0 and I (62.7%), while only 1.3% had stage IV disease. Five- and 10-year overall survival were 93.5% and 83.8%, respectively. According to multivariate analysis, age at diagnosis (HR 1.05; CI95 1.03-1.06), staging (stage III: HR 4.04; CI95 1.34-12.19; stage IV: HR 9.61; CI95 2.17-42.50), high KI67 (HR 5.46; CI95 1.27-23.32) and distant recurrence (HR 7.28; CI95 4.79-11.06) were significantly associated with survival. Smoking status, years of education, BMI, and tumor biological status were not significantly associated with mortality.This cohort of Brazilian patients, who received timely and appropriate treatment, achieved outcomes that are comparable to those from high income countries. Breast cancer mortality seems dependent on the quality of health care available to patients.",
  "Breast cancer survivors often have persisting headache. In a secondary analysis of the Brief Behavioral Therapy for Cancer-Related Insomnia (BBT-CI) clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02165839), the authors examined the effects of BBT-CI on headache outcomes in patients with breast cancer.Patients with breast cancer who were receiving chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive either the BBT-CI intervention or the Healthy EAting Education Learning for healthy sleep (HEAL) control intervention, and both were delivered over 6 weeks by trained staff. Headache outcomes and heart rate variability (HRV) were measured at baseline, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months. Mixed-effects models were used to examine longitudinal headache outcomes in the groups according to the intention to treat. Principal component analysis and agglomerative hierarchical clustering were conducted to reduce 16 variables for data-driven phenotyping.Patients in the BBT-CI arm (n = 73) exhibited a significant reduction in headache burden over time (P = .02; effect size [Cohen d] = 0.43), whereas the reduction was not significant among those in the HEAL arm (n = 66). The first principal component was positively loaded by headache, sleep, fatigue, and nausea/vomiting and was negatively loaded by cognitive, physical, and emotional functioning. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering revealed 3 natural clusters. Cluster I (n = 58) featured the highest burden of headache, insomnia, and nausea/vomiting; cluster II (n = 50) featured the lowest HRV despite a low burden of headache and insomnia; and cluster III (n = 31) showed an inverse relation between HRV and headache-insomnia, signifying autonomic dysfunction.BBT-CI is efficacious in reducing headache burden in breast cancer survivors. Patient phenotyping demonstrates a headache type featuring sleep disturbance, nausea/vomiting, and low physical functioning-revealing similarities to migraine.Breast cancer survivors often have persisting headache symptoms. In patients with cancer, treatment of chronic headache disorders using daily medications may be challenging because of drug interactions with chemotherapy and other cancer therapies as well as patients' reluctance to add more drugs to their medicine list. Headache and sleep disorders are closely related to each other. This study demonstrates that a sleep behavioral therapy reduced headache burden in breast cancer survivors. In addition, the majority of headache sufferers had a headache type with similarities to migraine-featuring sleep disturbance, nausea/vomiting, and low physical functioning.",
  "Basic leucine zipper ATF-like transcription factor 2 (BATF2) has been reported to participate in the occurrence and development of some malignancies. Herein, we aimed to explore the expression pattern and clinical implications of BATF2 in breast cancer (BC).We assessed the differences in BATF2 mRNA expression between cancerous and noncancerous tissues in BC using GEPIA and UALCAN data and in BATF2 protein expression pattern using Human Protein Atlas (HPA) data. BATF2 co-expression networks were analyzed in Coexpedia. The association between the differentially expressed BATF2 mRNA and BC prognosis was assessed using UALCAN, OSbrca, and GEPIA databases. In external validations, BATF2 protein expression in BC tissues was quantitated using a tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis, and BATF2 mRNA expression in serum and serum-derived exosomes of BC patients using real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).No difference in the BATF2 mRNA expression level was found between cancerous and noncancerous tissues in BC based on databases. There were low-to-moderate levels of increases in BATF2 protein expressions in BC cases from the HPA cohort. BATF2 mRNA expression was negatively correlated with androgen receptor (AR) and positively correlated with BRCA2 DNA repair associated (BRCA2), marker of proliferation Ki-67 (Mki67), and tumor protein p53 (TP53) expressions. Generally, BATF2 mRNA exhibited a non-significant association with BC prognosis; yet the subgroup analyses showed that triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients with high BATF2 mRNA expressions had a longer overall survival (OS). Our IHC analysis revealed a positive rate of BATF2 protein expression of 46.90%, mainly located in the nucleus of cancer cells in BC,\u00a0and the OS of BC patients with high BATF2 protein expressions was prolonged. The positive rates of BATF2 mRNA expressions in the serum and exosomes were 45.00 and 41.67%, respectively. Besides, the AUCs of serum and exosomal BATF2 mRNA for BC diagnosis were 0.8929 and 0.8869, respectively.BC patients exhibit low-to-moderate expressions in BATF2 mRNA expression levels in cancerous tissues. The high BATF2 protein expression can be a potential indicator of a better BC prognosis. Serum and exosomal BATF2 mRNA levels also serve as promising noninvasive biomarkers for BC diagnosis.",
  "The relation of premenopausal anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) levels with breast cancer risk has been evaluated in a few studies, but primarily in non-Hispanic White women.We evaluated the association of AMH levels with breast cancer risk in Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN), a multi-ethnic cohort of women. At enrollment, participants had an intact uterus and\u2009\u2265\u20091 ovary, and\u2009\u2265\u20091 menstrual period in the last 3\u00a0months. AMH at first measurement was assessed in 1,529 pre- or perimenopausal women using a high-sensitivity ELISA assay; values were natural log transformed. Breast cancer diagnoses were assessed at enrollment and subsequent follow-up visits through 2018 (median 6.1\u00a0years).In total, 84 women reported an incident breast cancer diagnosis. In multivariable Cox regression models adjusting for age, race and ethnicity, body mass index, and other factors, higher AMH levels were associated with a non-significant increased breast cancer risk. Compared to women in the 1st quartile, the hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for women in the\u00a04th quartile was 1.77 (0.87-3.60).Our results did not suggest a significant association between AMH and breast cancer risk; however, estimates were consistent with prior studies that reported positive associations.",
  "Polygenic risk scores (PRS) for breast cancer may help guide screening decisions. However, few studies have examined whether PRS are associated with risk of short-term or poor prognosis breast cancers. The study purpose was to evaluate the association of the 313 SNP breast cancer PRS with 2-year risk of poor prognosis breast cancer.We evaluated the association of breast cancer PRS with breast cancer overall, ER\u2009+\u2009and ER- breast cancer, and poor prognosis breast cancer diagnosed within 2\u00a0years of a negative mammogram among a cohort of 3657 women using logistic regression adjusted for age, breast density, race/ethnicity, year of screening, and genetic ancestry principal components. Breast cancers were considered poor prognosis if they were metastatic, positive lymph nodes, ER/PR\u2009+\u2009HER2- and\u2009>\u20092\u00a0cm, ER/PR/HER2-, or HER2\u2009+\u2009and\u2009>\u20091\u00a0cm.Of the 308 breast cancers, 137 (44%) were poor prognosis. The overall breast cancer PRS was significantly associated with breast cancer diagnosis within 2\u00a0years (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.23-1.57, p\u2009<\u20090.001). The breast cancer PRS was also associated specifically with diagnosis of poor prognosis disease (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.03-1.49, p\u2009=\u20090.018), but was more strongly associated with good prognosis cancer (OR 1.52 95% CI 1.29-1.80 p\u2009=\u20093.60\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-7</sup>) The ER\u2009+\u2009PRS was significantly associated with ER/PR\u2009+\u2009breast cancer (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.24-1.61, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and the ER-\u00a0PRS was significantly associated with ER-\u00a0breast cancer (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.08-2.02, p\u2009=\u20090.015).Breast cancer PRS was independently and significantly associated with diagnosis of both breast cancer overall and poor prognosis breast cancer within 2\u00a0years of a negative mammogram, suggesting PRS may help guide decisions about screening intervals and supplemental screening.",
  "Metformin has demonstrated a chemoprotective effect in breast cancer but there is limited evidence on the effect of cumulative exposure to metformin and the risk of hormone receptor-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HR\u2009+\u2009/HER2-) breast cancer. This study assessed this risk with dose and intensity of metformin in postmenopausal women with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).This nested case-control study used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data (2008-2015). Cohort entry was the date of incident T2DM diagnosis. Cases were those diagnosed with HR\u2009+\u2009/HER2- breast cancer (event date) as their first/only cancer. Non-cancer T2DM controls were matched using variable-ratio-matching. Cumulative dose and average intensity of metformin were measured during the 1-year lookback period. Dose(mg) was categorized as: (1)0, (2)0-30,000, (3)30,001-136,000, (4)136,001-293,000, and (5)\u2009>\u2009293,000, and intensity(mg/day) as: 0, 1-500, and\u2009>\u2009500. Covariates were conceptualized using the Andersen Behavioral Model. Conditional logistic regression was used to assess the risk of HR\u2009+\u2009/HER2- breast cancer with metformin-use.There were 690 cases and 2747 controls. The median duration of T2DM was 1178\u00a0days in controls and 1180\u00a0days in cases. Higher cumulative dose categories: 4 (adjusted odds ratio(aOR)\u2009=\u20090.72, 95% CI 0.55-0.95,p\u2009=\u20090.02), and 5 (OR\u2009=\u20090.60, 95% CI 0.42-0.85,p\u2009<\u20090.01) had significantly lower odds of HR\u2009+\u2009/HER2- breast cancer compared to category 0. The highest intensity category of metformin had 39% lower odds of HR\u2009+\u2009/HER2- breast cancer (OR\u2009=\u20090.61, 95% CI 0.46-0.82,p\u2009<\u20090.01) compared to the 0\u00a0mg/day group.Higher metformin exposure was associated with reduced risk of HR\u2009+\u2009/HER2- breast cancer, adding to the evidence supporting metformin's chemoprotective effect.",
  "Around 15-20% of primary breast cancers are characterized by HER2 protein overexpression and/or HER2 gene amplification. Despite the successful development of anti-HER2 drugs, intrinsic and acquired resistance represents a major hurdle. This study was performed to analyze the RANK pathway contribution in HER2-positive breast cancer and anti-HER2 therapy resistance.RANK and RANKL protein expression was assessed in samples from HER2-positive breast cancer patients resistant to anti-HER2 therapy and treatment-naive patients. RANK and RANKL gene expression was analyzed in paired samples from patients treated with neoadjuvant dual HER2-blockade (lapatinib and trastuzumab) from the SOLTI-1114 PAMELA trial. Additionally, HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines were used to modulate RANK expression and analyze in vitro the contribution of RANK signaling to anti-HER2 resistance and downstream signaling.RANK and RANKL proteins are more frequently detected in HER2-positive tumors that have acquired resistance to anti-HER2 therapies than in treatment-naive ones. RANK (but not RANKL) gene expression increased after dual anti-HER2 neoadjuvant therapy in the cohort from the SOLTI-1114 PAMELA trial. Results in HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines recapitulate the clinical observations, with increased RANK expression observed after short-term treatment with the HER2 inhibitor lapatinib or dual anti-HER2 therapy and in lapatinib-resistant cells. After RANKL stimulation, lapatinib-resistant cells show increased NF-\u03baB activation compared to their sensitive counterparts, confirming the enhanced functionality of the RANK pathway in anti-HER2-resistant breast cancer. Overactivation of the RANK signaling pathway enhances ERK and NF-\u03baB signaling and increases lapatinib resistance in different HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines, whereas RANK loss sensitizes lapatinib-resistant cells to the drug. Our results indicate that ErbB signaling is required for RANK/RANKL-driven activation of ERK in several HER2-positive cell lines. In contrast, lapatinib is not able to counteract the NF-\u03baB activation elicited after RANKL treatment in RANK-overexpressing cells. Finally, we show that RANK binds to HER2 in breast cancer cells and that enhanced RANK pathway activation alters HER2 phosphorylation status.Our data support a physical and functional link between RANK and HER2 signaling in breast cancer and demonstrate that increased RANK signaling may contribute to the development of lapatinib resistance through NF-\u03baB activation. Whether HER2-positive breast cancer patients with tumoral RANK expression might benefit from dual HER2 and RANK inhibition therapy remains to be elucidated.",
  "This study was aimed to assess the outcome of radiotherapy and determine prognostic factors for survival in breast cancer patients with clinically overt metastasis to the internal mammary lymph node (IMN+).We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 193 patients with IMN\u00a0+\u00a0breast cancer who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), breast surgery without internal mammary lymph node (IMN) dissection, and postoperative radiotherapy at 9 hospitals between 2009 and 2013. Breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy was performed after taxane-based NAC. Radiotherapy was administered to the whole breast/chest wall and regional nodes. IMN-covering radiotherapy was performed in 92.2% of patients with median dose of 58.4\u00a0Gy (range, 44.9-69.1\u00a0Gy). The overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and IMN failure-free survival (IMNFFS) were analyzed.After median follow-up of 71 months, 9 patients (4.7%) developed IMN failure and simultaneous distant metastasis. The 5-year DFS, OS, and IMNFFS was 68.6%, 81.8%, and 95.3%, respectively. Non-triple-negative breast cancer, Ki-67\u00a0\u2264\u00a010%, pathological complete response (CR) in tumor and axillary node, and radiologic CR of IMN after NAC were significant factors for predicting higher DFS; however, IMN radiation dose was not significant determinants for DFS. The 5-year DFS of patients with IMN-dose \u2264 50.0\u00a0Gy and those with >50.0\u00a0Gy was 86.7% and 76.7%, respectively (p\u00a0=\u00a00.41).A multimodality strategy including NAC, breast surgery, and IMN-covering radiotherapy was effective for patients with overt IMN\u00a0+\u00a0breast cancer. Even without an IMN dissection, most patients were IMN failure-free with an IMN-focusing radiotherapy.",
  "Breast microcalcifications is a characteristic feature in diagnostic imaging and a prognostic factor of breast cancer. However, the underlying mechanisms of breast microcalcifications formation are not fully understood. Previous studies have shown that upregulation of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) is associated with the occurrence of microcalcifications and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor microenvironment can secrete BMP-2. The aim of this study is to elucidate the role of secretion of BMP-2 by TAMs in promoting microcalcifications of breast cancer through immunohistochemical staining and co-culturing of breast cancer cells with TAMs.A total of 272 patients diagnosed with primary invasive breast cancer from January 2010 to January 2012 in the First Hospital of China Medical University were included in this study. Immunohistochemical staining of CD68 (marker of entire macrophages), CD168 (marker of the M2-like macrophages) and BMP-2 were performed on 4-\u03bcm tissue microarray (TMA) sections. Following induction, THP-1 cells were differentiated to M2-like TAMs and were then co-cultured with breast cancer cells (MCF-7). Calcifications and BMP-2 expression were analyzed by Alizarin Red S staining and western blot, respectively.Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the expression of CD168 was significantly increased in tissues with microcalcifications and was correlated with the expression of BMP-2 and poor prognosis. The formation of cellular microcalcifications and BMP-2 expression were significantly increased in MCF-7 cells co-cultured with TAMs compared with MCF-7 cells alone.These findings support the hypothesis that TAMs secrete BMP-2 to induce microcalcifications in breast cancer cells and influence prognosis via multiple pathways including BMP-2 and its downstream factors.",
  "MicroRNA (miR)\u2011125a\u20115p represses tafazzin phospholipid\u2011lysophospholipid transacylases\u00a0(TAFAZZIN) expression and inhibits the epithelial\u2011mesenchymal transition\u00a0(EMT) of ovarian cancer cells. EMT was found to have a crucial role in the acquisition of chemoresistance. Thus, the present study aimed to determine whether miR\u2011125a\u20115p reverses EMT and restores drug sensitivity by negatively regulating TAFAZZIN in breast cancer. The expression of miR\u2011125a\u20115p/TAFAZZIN and its association with chemotherapy response were determined in tissue samples from patients with breast cancer. Furthermore, the effects of miR\u2011125a\u20115p on breast cancer cells were elucidated using cell proliferation and cell apoptosis assays. Then, the regulatory mechanism of miR\u2011125a\u20115p in breast cancer was investigated by reverse transcription\u2011quantitative PCR, western blotting, dual\u2011luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. The results demonstrated that miR\u2011125a\u20115p inhibited the EMT of MCF\u20117/adriamycin (Adr) breast cancer cells, as well as decreased the proliferation and increased the apoptosis of breast cancer cells treated with Adr/docetaxel. In addition, miR\u2011125a\u20115p downregulated the expression levels of TAFAZZIN, Transglutaminase\u00a02, phosphorylated\u2011AKT, N\u2011cadherin, vimentin and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and significantly increased those of E\u2011cadherin, cleaved caspase-3 and Bax in MCF7/Adr cells. Similar results were obtained with small interfering RNA\u2011TAFAZZIN. Moreover, TAFAZZIN was identified as a direct target of miR\u2011125a\u20115p in MCF7/Adr breast cancer cells. In addition, increased miR\u2011125a\u20115p expression was observed in breast tumors from patients exhibiting a chemotherapy response, and TAFAZZIN mRNA expression was elevated in patients with no chemotherapy response. Hence, miR\u2011125a\u20115p expression was negatively correlated with TAFAZZIN mRNA expression in breast cancer tissues. All these data suggested that miR\u2011125a\u20115p reverses EMT and restores drug sensitivity by negatively regulating TAFAZZIN in breast cancer and, therefore, has potential as a novel therapeutic target for this disease.",
  "Breast cancer is a common neoplasm among women. This type of cancer is among malignancies in which role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been extensively explored. Some recently recognized lncRNAs have been less investigated in this neoplastic condition. LncRNAs that regulate tumor immunity are among those contributing in the pathogenesis of cancer. In the present expression assay, we compared expressions of nine immune-related lncRNAs namely lnc-MICAL3-2 (AC016027.1), lnc-DDX31 (AL445645.1), LINC01063, LINC02381, ENST0000615051 (AC083809.1), AC009237.14 (lnc-TRIM43B-1), ENST0000603791, LINC1234 and AC008760.1 between breast cancer samples and their paired non-cancerous samples. Expression levels of lnc-MICAL3-2, lnc-DDX31, LINC01063, LINC02381, ENST0000615051 and lnc-TRIM43B-1 were significantly decreased in breast cancer samples compared with paired control tissues (Posterior mean difference= -2.774, -2.012, -2.012, -2.015, -0.884 and -2.872; P values= 0.019, 0.0001, 0.0001, 0.0001, 0.032 and 0.0001, respectively). Expression levels of these lncRNAs have been associated with a number of clinical characteristics of breast cancer patients. Lnc-TRIM43B-1 had the highest performance in distinguishing between tumoral and non-tumoral tissues (AUC=0.82, Sensitivity=76%, Specificity=73.24%). As these lncRNAs could differentiate tumor samples from control samples, they might be regarded as putative tissue markers for breast cancer.",
  "Stage at diagnosis is a key determinant of breast cancer prognosis. In this study, we characterize stage at diagnosis and determine factors associated with advanced stage at diagnosis among women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in Addis Ababa, capital city of Ethiopia.Stage information was collected from medical records of 441 women with invasive breast cancer seen in seven major health facilities in Addis Ababa, from January 2017 to June 2018; these seven facilities capture 90% of all incident breast cancer cases in the city. We used multivariable Poisson regression model with robust variance to determine factors associated with advanced stage at diagnosis.The predominant tumor histology was ductal carcinoma (83.7%). More than half of the tumors' grade was moderately or poorly differentiated. The median tumor size at presentation was 4\u00a0cm. Sixty-four percent of the patients were diagnosed at advanced stage of the disease (44% stage III and 20% stage IV), with 36% of the patients diagnosed at early-stage (5% stage I and 31% stage II). The prevalence of advanced stage disease was significantly higher among women who used traditional medicine before diagnostic confirmation (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR]\u2009=\u20091.31; p\u2009=\u20090.001), had patient delay of >\u2009\u00a03 months (aPR\u2009=\u20091.16; p\u2009=\u20090.042) and diagnosis delay of\u2009>\u20092\u00a0months (aPR\u2009=\u20091.24; p\u2009=\u20090.004). But it was lower among women who had history of breast self-examination (aPR\u2009=\u20090.77; p\u2009=\u20090.021).Advanced stage at diagnosis of breast cancer among women in Addis Ababa is strongly associated with use of traditional medicine and with prolonged time interval between symptom recognition and disease confirmation. Community- and health systems-level interventions are needed to enhance knowledge about breast cancer and facilitate timely diagnoses.",
  "Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer among women and causes the greatest number of cancer-related death among women all over the world. It approximately accounts for 15% of all cancer death. The human microbiota is the term applied to the aggregate of microbes that live in different habitats of living organisms 'bodies, including the gut, skin, vagina, and mouth, as well as nose, conjunctiva, pharynx, and urethra, among others. Increasing evidence is pointing to the role of the microbiome in the occurrence and development of a variety of cancers. Intestinal microbiome imbalance is related to the occurrence of gastrointestinal tumors, such as esophageal, gastric, colorectal, and gallbladder cancer. The present study aimed to identify the role of microbiota in the development of breast cancer. The women with breast cancer (n=130) in this study were in the age range of 25-75 years. The study was conducted in Kirkuk city of Iraq from September 10, 2019, to March 15, 2020. The control group included 20 women diagnosed with benign breast lesions in the age range 25-75 years, who matched the women in the patient group. Blood samples and breast tissue samples were taken from patients with breast cancer and benign breast lesions. Blood samples were examined through immunological methods, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was adopted for the detection of interleukin-19 (IL-19). Breast tissue samples were taken from breast cancer and benign breast lesions patients to isolate and identify bacteria. Based on the obtained results, only 6 out of 30 (20%) cultured breast tissue samples from women with breast cancer showed bacterial growth. In total, 4 (67%) and 2(33%) of these 6 positive cultures were <i>Escherichia coli</i> was and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, respectively, and this relation was statistically significant. However, no bacterial growth was observed on the cultured breast tissue samples taken from women with benign breast lesions. Moreover, the difference between women with a positive and negative result of bacterial culture and stages of breast cancer was statistically non-significant. It is worth mentioning that 50 % of women with breast cancer and bacterial growth were within the age range of 40-49 year. The present study revealed that the difference between women with breast cancer and those with benign breast lesions was statistically highly significant according to the place of residence. In addition, the mean level of IL-19 among women with breast cancer was lower than that in women with benign breast lesions, and this relation was statistically highly significant.",
  "MicroRNA-27a (miR-27a) is a small non-coding RNA, shown to play a role in multiple cancers, including the regulation of ER\u03b1 expression in breast cancer. Most ER\u03b1 positive tumors are treated with Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs) and thus the role of miR-27a expression in response to SERM treatment is of interest.Tamoxifen resistant cells were generated by molecular evolution with six cycles of tamoxifen treatment. MCF7 and T47D luminal A breast cancer cell lines were either treated with miR-27a mimics, or ER-signaling was modulated ectopically. The changes were analyzed with RT-qPCR, western blotting and transcriptional activity ERE-reporter assays. Moreover, the response to SERM treatments (tamoxifen, endoxifen and toremifen) was investigated by cell viability and apoptosis measurements. An in silico analysis of survival data from the METABRIC study was performed in order to assess the prognostic value of miR-27a for response to SERM treatment.Tamoxifen-resistant cells showed decreased expression of ER\u03b1 and miR-27a. The overexpression of miR-27a increased the levels of ER\u03b1, while modulation of ER\u03b1 decreased miR-27a expression. High miR-27a expression increased the sensitivity of MCF7 and T47D cells to SERM treatments and re-sensitized the cells to tamoxifen. Patient survival of luminal A breast cancer patients that underwent endocrine therapies was better in groups with high miR-27a expression.MiR-27a sensitizes luminal A breast cancer cells to SERM treatments based on a positive feedback loop with ER\u03b1. An increased overall-survival of ER-positive breast cancer patients that underwent endocrine treatments and displayed high miR-27a levels was found.",
  "We investigated the expression of TLR genes and the effects of CpG ODN in Estrogen Receptor positive, Progesterone Receptor positive breast cancer cell line (T47D) and a triple-negative breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-468) followed by studying the immunostimulatory activity of CpG oligonucleotides in breast cancer cell lines T47D and MDA-MB-468.We evaluated the expression pattern of TLR genes (TLR1 to TLR9) in T47D and MDA-MB-468 cells using Real-time qPCR analysis. The intracellular TLR9 protein expression was studied by flow cytometry. The effect of CpG ODN on cell viability was tested using MTT assay. The relative expression of pro-inflammatory (IL6 and TNF\u03b1) and anti- inflammatory/immunosuppressive cytokines genes (IL10 and TGF beta1) were examined by Real-time qPCR.We found that MDA-MB-468 cells expressed TLR2, TLR3, TLR6, TLR8, and TLR9 genes and T47D cells expressed TLR3, TRL5, TLR8, and TLR9 genes. Stimulation of TLR9 <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> with CpG significantly reduced the cell viability of T47D and MDA-MB-468 cells. IL6 cytokine gene expression was significantly reduced in both CpG treated T47D cells and MDA-MB-468 cells. TNF\u03b1 gene expression was significantly reduced after treatment with CpG in MDA-MB-468 cells but not in T47D cells. IL10 and TGF\u03b21 expression were downregulated in CpG treated T47D cells. Whereas, IL10 and TGF\u03b21 were elevated in CpG treated MDA-MB-468 cells.Our <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> finding gives preliminary evidence that triggering TLR9 using CpG ODN decreases the cell proliferation and alters the pro-inflammatory cytokines in favor of inhibition of hormone receptor positive breast cancer cells T47D and triple negative breast cancer cells MDA-MB-468.",
  "The association between the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) and breast cancer risk has been widely reported in recent years, but there is still controversy about whether a pro-inflammatory diet is a risk factor for breast cancer. We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between the DII and breast cancer risk in pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women. We comprehensively searched PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library in January 2021 to identify articles reporting an association between the DII and breast cancer risk. A pooled analysis was conducted with 14 studies covering 312,885 participants. Overall, women in the most pro-inflammatory diet category were at greater risk for breast cancer than those in the most anti-inflammatory category (relative risk [RR]=1.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17-1.60, P<0.001). This association was strong in both pre-menopausal women (RR=1.87, 95% CI 1.17-2.99, P=0.001) and post-menopausal women (RR=1.23, 95% CI 1.08-1.40, P<0.001). Thus, a strong and independent association was observed between a pro-inflammatory diet (assessed using the DII score) and breast cancer risk, irrespective of menopausal status. Further studies will be required to determine the relationship between a pro-inflammatory diet and different subtypes of breast cancer.",
  "Although previous experiments have implicated sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) as a links between immune reactions and cancer progression, the exact mechanism of this interaction has not comprehensively studied in clinical human samples. This study sought to evaluate the S1P regulation by sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1), an S1P-producing enzyme, in the immunity/immuno-reactivity of clinical human breast cancer surgical specimens.S1P levels were examined in tumor, peritumoral, and normal human breast samples using mass spectrometry. Genomics Data Commons data portal of The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort was used to assess the expression of S1P-related and immune-related genes.S1P levels were significantly higher in tumor samples compared to peritumoral (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) or normal human breast samples (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). SPHK1 gene expression was elevated in tumoral samples compared to normal breast samples (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Furthermore, the elevated expression of SPHK1 in breast cancer tissue was associated with an increased expression of the different kinds of immune-related genes, such as CD68, CD163, CD4, and FOXP3 (forkhead box P3), in HER2-negative breast cancer. Network analysis showed the central role of SPHK1 in the interaction of S1P signaling and expression of immune cell-related proteins.We demonstrated that S1P is mainly produced by tumor tissue, rather than peritumoral tissue, in breast cancer patients. Our data revealed the involvement of S1P signaling in the regulation of immune-related genes, suggesting the links between S1P and complicated immune-cancer interactions in breast cancer patients.",
  "Breast cancer is defined as a biological and molecular heterogeneous disorder that originates from breast cells. Genetic predisposition is the most important factor giving rise to this malignancy. The most notable mutations in breast cancer occur in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Owing to disease heterogeneity, lack of therapeutic target, anti-cancer drug resistance, residual disease, and recurrence, researchers are faced with challenges in developing strategies to treat patients with breast cancer.It has recently been reported that epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation and histone modification, as well as microRNAs (miRNAs), have potently contributed to the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of breast cancer. These observations have persuaded researchers to move their therapeutic approaches beyond the genetic framework toward the epigenetic concept.Herein we discuss the molecular and epigenetic mechanisms underlying breast cancer progression and resistance as well as various aspects of epigenetic-based therapies as monotherapy and combined with immunotherapy.",
  "A prediction model with high sensitivity for the detection of negative axillary involvement can reduce additional axillary surgery in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) upstaged to invasive cancer while saving patients with pure DCIS from unnecessary axillary surgeries. Using a nationwide database, we developed and validated a scoring system for guidance in selective sentinel lymph node biopsy omission.A total of 41,895 patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer from the Korean Breast Cancer Registry were included. The study cohort was randomly divided for the development and validation of the prediction model. Missing data were filled in using multiple imputation. Factors that were significantly associated with axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis in > 50% of datasets were included in the final prediction model.The frequency of ALN metastasis in the total cohort was 24.5%. After multivariable logistic regression analysis, variables that were associated with ALN metastasis were palpability, multifocality, location, size, histologic type, grade, lymphovascular invasion, hormone receptor expression, and Ki-67 level. A scoring system was developed using these factors. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the scoring system was 0.750 in both training and validating sets. The cutoff value for performing sentinel lymph node biopsy was determined as a score of 4 to obtain prediction sensitivity higher than 95%.A scoring system to predict the probability of ALN metastasis was developed and validated. The application of this system in the clinic may reduce unnecessary axillary surgeries in patients with DCIS and minimize additional axillary surgery for upstaged patients with invasive cancer.",
  "It is well-known that obesity has an adverse impact on breast cancer prognosis; nonetheless, the prognostic role of abdominal obesity, especially its post-diagnosis change, has been understudied. This study aims to examine the prospective associations of general and abdominal obesity and their post-diagnosis changes with all-cause mortality, breast cancer-specific mortality, and breast cancer recurrence in Chinese breast cancer patients.From 2011 to 2014, 1460 Chinese breast cancer patients were recruited and followed up at 18, 36, and 60\u00a0months after diagnosis. Body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and their changes between baseline and 18-month follow-up were derived. Clinical records on diagnosis, treatment, and death were also obtained. In total, 1309 women who completed the 18-month follow-up were included for Cox regression analyses, stratified by follow-up periods.Within 18-48\u00a0months post-diagnosis, substantial WHR loss (5% or above) had reduced risk of all-cause (HR\u2009=\u20090.21 [95% CI 0.06-0.75]) and breast cancer-specific mortality (0.21 [0.06-0.77]) relative to stable WHR; whereas after 48\u00a0months post-diagnosis, substantial WHR gain showed elevated risks of all-cause mortality (2.67 [1.22-5.85])). Higher baseline WHR was also associated with both mortality outcomes. Nonetheless, no such associations were observed for BMI measures. Also, the effects of obesity measures on breast recurrence were less apparent.Abdominal obesity, rather than general obesity, was linked to worse survival in Chinese breast cancer patients. Prevention on abdominal obesity and waist gain following breast cancer diagnosis may have a beneficial effect on longer-term survival over and above conventional weight management. Waist assessment and abdominal obesity control should therefore be incorporated as a vital component of the evaluation and interventions of breast cancer prognosis.",
  "Mammographic Density (MD) refers to the amount of fibroglandular breast tissue present in the breast and is an established risk factor for developing breast cancer. The ability to evaluate treatment response dynamically renders neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) the preferred treatment option in many clinical scenarios. Previous studies have suggested that MD can predict patients likely to achieve a pathological complete response (pCR) to NACT. We aimed to determine whether there is a causal relationship between BI-RADS breast composition categories for breast density at diagnosis and the pCR rate and residual cancer burden score (RCB) by performing a retrospective review on consecutive breast cancer patients who received NACT in a tertiary referral centre from 2015 to 2021.The Mann-Whitney U Test was used to test for differences between two independent groups (i.e. those who achieved pCR and those who did not). A binary logistic regression model was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for an association between the independent variables of molecular subtype, MD, histological grade and FNA positivity and the dependant variable of pCR. Statistical analysis was conducted with SPSS (IBM SPSS for Mac, Version 26.0; IBM Corp).292 patients were included in the current study. There were 124, 155 and 13 patients in the BI-RADS MD category b, c and d, respectively. There were no patients in the BI-RADS MD category a. The patients with less dense breast composition (MD category b) were significantly older than patients with denser breast composition (MD category c, d) (p\u2009=\u20090.001) and patients who had a denser breast composition (MD category d) were more likely to have ER+\u2009tumours. There was no significant difference in PgR status, HER2 status, pathological complete response (pCR), FNA positivity, or RCB class dependent upon the three MD categories. A binary logistic regression revealed that patients with HER2-enriched breast cancer and triple-negative breast cancer are more likely to achieve pCR with an OR of 3.630 (95% CI 1.360-9.691, p\u2009=\u20090.010) and 2.445 (95% CI 1.131-5.288, p\u2009=\u20090.023), respectively.Whilst dense MD was associated with ER positivity and these women were less likely to achieve a pCR, MD did not appear to independently predict pCR post-NACT.",
  "Breast density is an independent risk factor for breast cancer and significantly decreases the sensitivity of mammography. Assessing a woman's risk of developing breast cancer is becoming increasingly important for establishing individual screening recommendations and preventive strategies. This article reviews the factors influencing mammographic density (MD), the available methods of MD assessment, and its effect on breast cancer. Finally, we discuss the supplemental screening methods for women with dense breast tissue.",
  "Many young women with newly diagnosed breast cancer are interested in future pregnancies. Prospective data regarding fertility interest and reproductive patterns after diagnosis are needed to counsel patients.The Young Women's Breast Cancer Study is a multicenter, prospective cohort of women who were diagnosed with breast cancer at age \u226440 years between 2006 and 2016. Women complete surveys at baseline, every 6 months for 3 years, then annually. Here, the authors describe fertility interest and pregnancies within 5 years of diagnosis for women with stage 0 through III breast cancer.Of 1026 eligible participants, 368 (36%) reported interest in future biologic children at least once within 5 years after diagnosis, including 16% at 5 years after diagnosis. Among 130 women who attempted to become pregnant, 90 (69.2%) conceived; and, among 896 women who did not attempt to conceive, 18 (2.0%) became pregnant, with a total of 152 pregnancies resulting in 91 live births. Factors associated with pregnancy included younger versus older age at diagnosis (aged \u226430 vs 36-40 years: odds ratio [OR], 6.63; 95% CI, 3.18-13.83; P < .0001; aged 31-35 vs 36-40 years: OR, 5.86; 95% CI, 3.37-10.17; P < .0001) and being nulliparous versus parous (OR, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.56-4.53; P = .001). The receipt of endocrine therapy versus no endocrine therapy (OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.20-0.59; P = .001) was inversely associated with pregnancy.Many women remain interested in future fertility in the 4 years after a breast cancer diagnosis, indicating that longitudinal fertility discussions are needed. Although a minority of those interested in having children attempted to become pregnant in the first 5 years, most who attempted to conceive did so and had live births.",
  "In breast cancer, large tumor size, positive nodal stage and a triple-negative tumor subtype are associated with reduced survival, but the interactions between these prognostic factors are not well understood.Here we re-evaluated the impact of tumor size, nodal stage and tumor subtype on disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), distant disease-free survival (DDFS) and breast cancer specific survival (BCSS) in a retrospective analysis using data from the adjuvant SUCCESS A trial. Subgroup analyses were conducted to assess whether the effect of tumor size and nodal stage on survival depended on tumor subtype.Increasing tumor size, higher nodal stage and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) were associated with unfavorable prognosis (all p\u202f<\u202f0.001). There was no significant interaction between tumor subtype and tumor size (p\u202f>\u202f0.5 for all four survival endpoints), but we found significant interactions between tumor subtype and nodal stage (p\u202f<\u202f0.05 for all four survival endpoints), with no differences in survival among tumor subtypes for patients with pN0 tumors (all p\u202f>\u202f0.05) and pronounced differences in survival among tumor subtypes for patients with positive nodal stage (all p\u202f<\u202f0.001).This analysis confirms tumor size, nodal stage and tumor subtype as independent prognostic factors in high-risk early breast cancer. Nodal-positive patients with TNBC had a considerably worse outcome compared to nodal-positive patients with another tumor subtype. This underlines the importance for early detection particularly for patients with TNBC.EudraCT 2005-000490-21; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02181101.",
  "CDK4/6 inhibitors have an established role in the treatment of hormone receptor positive HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. All studies conducted in metastatic breast cancer showed a benefit in delaying progression when added to standard endocrine therapy, regardless of therapy line, pretreatment, menopausal status, site of metastasis, CDK4/6 inhibitor used and associated endocrine therapy. A benefit in overall survival has also been demonstrated. In early breast cancer, only the MonarchE study has shown an improved invasive disease-free survival with abemaciclib taken for 2 years, whereas the Penelope-B did not meet the primary endpoint and the PALLAS study was terminated early for futility. Studies conducted in the neoadjuvant setting might help to explain the discordant results.",
  "Locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) is defined here as inoperable breast adenocarcinoma without distant metastases. Patients with LABC require a multidisciplinary approach. Given the risk of distant metastasis, staging exams are necessary. The incidence of LABC (stages IIIB and IIIC) has decreased in recent years. LABC has rarely been investigated separately: patients with LABC have participated both in clinical trials of palliative and of neoadjuvant therapy. Most trials did not analyze responses and long-term outcomes independently; thus, the treatment of patients with LABC is extrapolated from studies of patients with less or more advanced disease. Pathologic confirmation and molecular profiling are essential for the choice of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Preoperative endocrine therapy may be considered in certain clinical situations; the addition of a CDK4/6 inhibitor is being investigated. HER2 positive LABCs are targeted with anti-HER2 agents combined with chemotherapy. PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies in 'triple-negative' LABC are promising. Excellent responses to neoadjuvant therapy enable conservative surgery in many patients; however, inflammatory breast cancer may still indicate mastectomy. Postoperative radiotherapy is usually indicated. Target volumes include breast/chest wall, axillary, supraclavicular and internal mammary nodal basins. Preoperative radiation therapy can be useful in patients without response to systemic therapies. Palliative surgery for poor responders after neoadjuvant systemic and radiation therapy can be considered. Multidisciplinary teams can optimize local control and prevent relapses. However, modest improvement in survival was achieved between 2000 and 2014 underscoring the unmet need in patients with LABC who will benefit from specific research efforts in this disease entity.",
  "Breast cancer represents an urgent global priority. While this is a universal issue, and as the burden of the disease is increasing globally, current estimates indicate that in the next couple of decades, much of the incidence and mortality related to breast cancer will be seen in underserved populations. The fragile and ill-prepared healthcare systems in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) need to address this challenge and find solutions with their limited resources. Significant disparities can be identified in stage at presentation as the ability to detect the disease in earlier stages is compromised in these scenarios leading to worse outcomes associated to late diagnoses. Furthermore, access to healthcare in general and to basic surgical, radiotherapy and systemic care is suboptimal additionally limiting treatment results. With a small portion of their budget allocated to healthcare, LMIC need to make the most of their resources prioritizing cost-effective strategies that could offer the best possible results. Countries that invest in women's health do develop into healthier, more educated, and importantly, more productive societies with benefits seen across generations. Finally, recognition of inequities should stimulate a concerted effort engaging all involved stakeholders to find context-adapted solutions to improve healthcare outcomes.",
  "In order to use a breast cancer prediction model in clinical practice to guide screening and prevention, it must be well calibrated and validated in samples independent from the one used for development. We assessed the accuracy of the breast cancer surveillance consortium (BCSC) model in a racially diverse population followed for up to 10\u00a0years.The BCSC model combines breast density with other risk factors to estimate a woman's 5- and 10-year risk of invasive breast cancer. We validated the model in an independent cohort of 252,997 women in the Chicago area. We evaluated calibration using the ratio of expected to observed (E/O) invasive breast cancers in the cohort and discrimination using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).In an independent cohort of 252,997 women (median age 50 years, 26% non-Hispanic Black), the BCSC model was well calibrated (E/O\u2009=\u20090.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90-0.98), but underestimated the incidence of invasive breast cancer in younger women and in women with low mammographic density. The AUROC was 0.633, similar to that observed in prior validation studies.The BCSC model is a well-validated risk assessment tool for breast cancer that may be particularly useful when assessing the utility of supplemental screening in women with dense breasts.",
  "Individuals carrying pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations have an increased lifetime risk of breast and/or ovarian cancer. The incidence of breast cancer amongst disease-free BRCA mutation carriers under surveillance and the clinical and pathological characteristics of those who subsequently develop the disease remain unclear in Japan. We reviewed the records of 155 individuals with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations identified by genetic testing between January 2000 and December 2016. At the time of genetic testing, 26 individuals with one of these mutations had no history of breast cancer and were therefore enrolled in a surveillance program that included biannual ultrasonography, clinical breast examination, annual mammography, and conditional magnetic resonance imaging for the early detection of primary breast cancer. During the surveillance period, 5 individuals with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations were diagnosed with primary breast cancer. The mean surveillance duration until breast cancer diagnosis was 48\u00a0months. The incidence of primary breast cancer during surveillance in initially disease-free BRCA mutation carriers was 4.23%/year. In two cases, the tumors were only detectable on MRI. The case 5 patient who presented with a tumor that was detected by self-examination, which then grew rapidly, had stage IIB triple-negative breast cancer. In conclusion, our results show that some challenges exist in the early detection of breast cancers in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers. There are also some difficulties in approaching those individuals in Japanese society.",
  "In Ontario, patients with breast cancer typically receive their diagnoses through the Ontario Breast Screening Program (OBSP) after an abnormal screen, through screening initiated by a primary care provider or other referring physician, or through follow-up of symptoms by patients' primary care providers. We sought to explore the association of the route to diagnosis (screening within or outside the OBSP or via symptomatic presentation) with use of OBSP-affiliated breast assessment sites (O-BAS), wait times until diagnosis or treatment, health care use and overall survival for patients with breast cancer.In this retrospective cohort study, we used the Ontario Cancer Registry to identify adults (aged 18-105 yr) who received a diagnosis of breast cancer from 2013 to 2017. We excluded patients if they were not Ontario residents or had missing age or sex, or who died before diagnosis. We used logistic regression to evaluate factors associated with categorical variables (whether patients were or were not referred to an OBAS, whether patients were screened or symptomatic) and Cox proportional hazards regression to identify factors associated with all-cause mortality.Of 51 460 patients with breast cancer, 42 598 (83%) received their diagnoses at an O-BAS. Patients whose cancer was first detected through the OBSP were more likely than symptomatic patients to be given a diagnosis at an O-BAS (adjusted odds ratio 1.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.57 to 1.80). Patients screened by the OBSP were given their diagnoses 1 month earlier than symptomatic patients, but diagnosis at an O-BAS did not affect the time until either diagnosis or treatment. Patients referred to an O-BAS had significantly better overall survival than those who were not referred (adjusted hazard ratio 0.73, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.80).Patients screened through the OBSP were given their diagnoses earlier than symptomatic patients and were more likely to be referred to an O-BAS, which was associated with better survival. Our findings suggest that individuals with signs and symptoms of breast cancer would benefit from similar referral processes, oversight and standards to those used by the OBSP.",
  "Use of aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been hypothesized to be associated with reduced risk of breast cancer; however, results of epidemiological studies have been mixed. Few studies have investigated these associations among African American women.To assess the relation of aspirin use to risk of breast cancer in African American women, we conducted a prospective analysis within the Black Women's Health Study, an ongoing nationwide cohort study of 59,000 African American women. On baseline and follow-up questionnaires, women reported regular use of aspirin (defined as use at least 3\u00a0days per week) and years of use. During follow-up from 1995 through 2017, 1919 invasive breast cancers occurred, including 1112 ER+, 569 ER-, and 284 triple-negative (TN) tumors. We used age-stratified Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations of aspirin use with risk of ER+, ER-, and TN breast cancer, adjusted for established breast cancer risk factors.Overall, the HR for current regular use of aspirin relative to non-use was 0.92 (95% CI 0.81, 1.04). For ER+, ER-, and TN breast cancer, corresponding HRs were 0.98 (0.84, 1.15), 0.81 (0.64, 1.04), and 0.70 (0.49, 0.99), respectively.Our findings with regard to ER- and TN breast cancer are consistent with hypothesized inflammatory mechanisms of ER- and TN breast cancer, rather than hormone-dependent pathways. Aspirin may represent a potential opportunity for chemoprevention of ER- and TN breast cancer.",
  "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to play crucial roles in breast cancer. This study aimed to determine the clinical significance and biological functions of lncRNA AFAP1-AS1 in breast cancer.The expression of AFAP1-AS1 in breast cancer tissue and adjacent normal tissue from 160 patients and breast cancer cell lines were determined by qRT-PCR. The clinical characteristics of patients were collected to analyse the correlation between AFAP1-AS1 expression and malignancy status. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards model were used to analyze whether AFAP1-AS1 expression impacted prognosis. To assess the effect of AFAP1-AS1 on MCF-7 cells proliferation, cell viability, EdU incorporation and colony formation assays were conducted after AFAP1-AS1 knockdown by siRNA. The apoptosis was detected by Caspase-3 activity, cell cycle analysis, Bcl-2 and Bax protein expression. Wound scratch assay and EMT-related protein expression (E-cadherin, N-cadherin and Vimentin) were conducted to evaluate the metastasis ability. To further determine the effect of AFAP1-AS1 on AFAP1, the mRNA and protein expression of AFAP1 and subsequent actin filament integrity were measured after AFAP1-AS1 knockdown.The expression of AFAP1-AS1 was up-regulated in human breast cancer tissue and associated with malignancy status, high expression of AFAP1-AS1 had a poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. AFAP1-AS1 expression was up-regulated in 4 breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, SK-RB-3, MDA-MB-231and MDA-MB-468) compared with normal breast cell line HBL-100. MCF-7, the most up-regulation cancer cell, was used for following studies. AFAP1-AS1 knockdown can inhibit the proliferation, metastasis and promote apoptosis of MCF-7. However, the AFAP1 expression and actin filament integrity was not affected after AFAP1-AS1 knockdown.Up-regulated lncRNA AFAP1-AS1 indicates a poor prognosis in breast cancer patients and regulated the breast cancer cells proliferation, apoptosis and metastasis.",
  "This study investigated whether hypofractionated adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) increased breast-related complication(s) compared to conventional fractionated RT in reconstructed breast cancer patients.We conducted a retrospective review including 349 breast cancer patients who underwent immediate breast reconstruction following mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery (BCS) between 2009 and 2018\u00a0at two institutions. All patients were treated with adjuvant RT via either a conventional fractionated or hypofractionated regimen. We defined a major breast complication as a breast-related toxic event requiring re-operation or re-hospitalization during the follow-up period after the end of RT.The median follow-up was 32.3 months (4.8-118.5 months); 126 patients had conventional fractionated RT, and 223 patients received hypofractionated RT. In patients with mastectomy, there was no significant difference in the occurrence of any or major breast-related complications between the two fractionation regimens. In patients undergoing BCS, incidence of any breast complication showed no difference between two RT groups and no major breast complication was reported as well. Hypofractionated RT did not increase major wound problem (infection and dehiscence) compared to conventional RT. Incidence of major contracture was significantly lower in hypofractionated RT.There was no significant difference in the occurrence of any or major breast-related complications between the two different fractionation regimens, even in patients with mastectomy. Hypofractionated RT may be used comparable to conventional fractionated RT in terms of breast-related complications in reconstructed breast cancer patients. The prospective randomized trial would be necessary to clarify this issue.",
  "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality in early-stage breast cancer survivors. Recent studies suggest that bisphosphonates may decrease CVD risk in older patients.This study sought to assess whether bisphosphonate use is associated with lower rates of incident CVD events among early-stage breast cancer survivors.Longitudinal, population-based cohort study was conducted by using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results registry linked to Medicare claims. We identified women >65 years with no history of CVD who were diagnosed with stage 0-III primary breast cancer between 2007 and 2010. Our primary outcome was a composite of incident angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation/flutter, heart failure, or stroke within 36 months of cancer diagnosis. Bisphosphonate use was defined as the presence of \u22651 pharmacy claim from 6 months prior to cancer diagnosis to the incident CVD event. We used propensity scores to create a matched group of breast cancer survivors without bisphosphonate exposure to compare rates of incident CVD events.A total of 2178 breast cancer survivors had \u22651 bisphosphonate prescription; the average length of bisphosphonate use was 15 months. Analyses of the matched data showed that 13.0% of bisphosphonate users and 23.4% of non-bisphosphonate users experienced an incident CVD event (p\u202f<\u202f0.0001) after breast cancer diagnosis. Bisphosphonate use was significantly associated with fewer incident CVD events (hazard ratio: 0.51, 95% confidence interval: 0.44 to 0.59).Bisphosphonate use is associated with lower incidence of CVD events among older early-stage breast cancer survivors. Future studies should prospectively evaluate whether bisphosphonate use can decrease CVD incidence.",
  "In breast cancer patients, post chemotherapy weight gain is linked with increased risk of cancer recurrence. We prospectively studied a cohort of premenopausal women receiving contemporary chemotherapy following a diagnosis of breast cancer to examine factors predicting weight increase.Between May 2005 and January 2008, 523 patients from the Prospective Outcomes in Sporadic versus Hereditary (POSH) breast cancer study entered this sub-study comparing weight prior to chemotherapy and weight and waist/hip measurements 12-months following chemotherapy.Data from 380 patients were available. Mean (standard deviation [SD]) pre-treatment body mass index (BMI) was 26.3 (5.6) kg/m<sup>2</sup>; 30% women gained\u202f>\u202f5% body weight during the study period. Lower BMI at diagnosis predicted greater subsequent post treatment weight gain (4.3% relative weight gain for those in the 1st quartile of BMI compared to 0.8% for those in the 4th quartile; r\u202f=\u202f-0.22; p\u202f<\u202f0.001). No link to chemotherapy regimens, cigarette smoking, previous parity or chemotherapy induced amenorrhoea was noted. A total of 44% of women had central obesity (post-treatment waist measurement of \u226588\u202fcm).Almost a third of premenopausal patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer will gain clinically significant weight and over 40% will have central obesity 12-months following diagnosis. A greater weight gain is predicted by lower pretreatment BMI.",
  "To update recommendations on appropriate use of breast cancer biomarker assay results to guide adjuvant endocrine and chemotherapy decisions in early-stage breast cancer.An updated literature search identified randomized clinical trials and prospective-retrospective studies published from January 2016 to October 2021. Outcomes of interest included overall survival and disease-free or recurrence-free survival. Expert Panel members used informal consensus to develop evidence-based recommendations.The search identified 24 studies informing the evidence base.Clinicians may use Onco<i>type</i> DX, MammaPrint, Breast Cancer Index (BCI), and EndoPredict to guide adjuvant endocrine and chemotherapy in patients who are postmenopausal or age > 50 years with early-stage estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative (ER+ and HER2-) breast cancer that is node-negative or with 1-3 positive nodes. Prosigna and BCI may be used in postmenopausal patients with node-negative ER+ and HER2- breast cancer. In premenopausal patients, clinicians may use Onco<i>type</i> in patients with node-negative ER+ and HER2- breast cancer. Current data suggest that premenopausal patients with 1-3 positive nodes benefit from chemotherapy regardless of genomic assay result. There are no data on use of genomic tests to guide adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with \u2265 4 positive nodes. Ki67 combined with other parameters or immunohistochemistry 4 score may be used in postmenopausal patients without access to genomic tests to guide adjuvant therapy decisions. BCI may be offered to patients with 0-3 positive nodes who received 5 years of endocrine therapy without evidence of recurrence to guide decisions about extended endocrine therapy. None of the assays are recommended for treatment guidance in individuals with HER2-positive or triple-negative breast cancer. Treatment decisions should also consider disease stage, comorbidities, and patient preferences.Additional information is available at www.asco.org/breast-cancer-guidelines.",
  "Louisiana has the third highest breast cancer mortality in the US, despite ranking 30th in incidence. Whether surgical approach contributes to such a poor outcome is unknown. We compared outcomes of breast-conserving surgery plus radiation (BCT) vs mastectomy (MST) for Louisiana women with early-stage breast cancer.Data on women diagnosed with Stage I-II breast cancer from 2004 to 2016 were analyzed from the Louisiana Tumor Registry. Overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (CSS) were compared between BCT and MST. Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to compare survival curves, and logistic regression was used to examine the association of\u00a0sociodemographic and clinical factors with the type of breast cancer surgery. Values of p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 were considered significant.Of the 18,260 patients, 9,968 patients (54.6%) had BCT and 8,292 patients (45.4%) had MST. Compared with BCT, the MST group tended to be underinsured/Medicare/Medicaid, more impoverished, had higher stage 2 disease, were more likely to reside in rural regions, travel \u226525 miles to radiation treatment facility, be treated at low volume centers, and have T3, node positive, and poorly differentiated tumors. Ten-year OS and CSS were significantly better among those who had BCT (OS: 80.0%; 95% CI: 79.0%-81.1%; CSS: 92.7%; 95% CI: 92.1%-93.4%) than those having MST (OS: 69.3%; 95% CI: 68.0%-70.5%; CSS: 88.8%:95% CI: 87.9%-89.7%) (p < 0.05). Even after controlling for sociodemographic and clinical variables, MST was associated with a 28.6% increased risk of death from all causes (hazard ratio [HR]:1.286; 95% CI:1.197-1.380) and a 29.8% increased risk of breast-cancer specific death (HR:1.298; 95% CI: 1.150-1.465).Surgical approach, a factor that is within the control of the surgeon, has an impact on mortality for Louisiana women with early-stage breast cancer.",
  "ER+ breast cancer is the most common type of breast cancer, which seriously affects the physical and mental health of women. Recently, lncRNAs mediated tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) were identified to involve in tumorigenesis. Therefore, the present study aimed at demonstrating the regulatory network of GNAS-AS1 in TAM-mediated ER+ breast cancer progress.The expression levels of genes were evaluated using qRT-PCR. The proportions of polarized macrophages (M1, M2) were assessed by flow cytometry. Cell proliferation, migration and invasion were evaluated by CCK-8, wound healing and transwell assay, respectively. Double-luciferase reporter system was used to detect the interaction between molecules. Western blot was applied to test protein levels.The expression of GNAS-AS1 was obviously increased in ER+ breast cancer tissues and cell lines, as well as M2 macrophages. GNAS-AS1 facilitated the capabilities of proliferation, migration and invasion of ER+ breast cancer cells by accelerating M2 macrophage polarization via directly sponging miR-433-3p. GATA3, as a target of miR-433-3p, could positively regulate by GNAS-AS1. Furthermore, either miR-433-3p overexpression or GATA3 knockdown impaired the effects of GNAS-AS1 on M2 macrophage polarization and ER+ breast cancer cells progression.GNAS-AS1/miR-433-3p/GATA3 axis promoted proliferation, metastasis of ER+ breast cancer cells by accelerating M2 macrophage polarization. The mechanism may provide a new strategy and target for ER+ breast cancer treatment.",
  "Approximately 25% of patients with early-stage breast cancer experience cancer progression throughout the disease course. Alterations in TMEM240 in breast cancer were identified and investigated to monitor treatment response and disease progression.Circulating methylated TMEM240 in the plasma of breast cancer patients was used to monitor treatment response and disease progression. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data in Western countries and Illumina methylation arrays in Taiwanese breast cancer patients were used to identify novel hypermethylated CpG sites and genes related to poor hormone therapy response. Quantitative methylation-specific PCR (QMSP), real-time reverse transcription PCR, and immunohistochemical analyses were performed to measure DNA methylation and mRNA and protein expression levels in 394 samples from Taiwanese and Korean breast cancer patients. TMEM240 gene manipulation, viability, migration assays, RNA-seq, and MetaCore were performed to determine its biological functions and relationship to hormone drug treatment response in breast cancer cells.Aberrant methylated TMEM240 was identified in breast cancer patients with poor hormone therapy response using genome-wide methylation analysis in the Taiwan and TCGA breast cancer cohorts. A cell model showed that TMEM240, which is localized to the cell membrane and cytoplasm, represses breast cancer cell proliferation and migration and regulates the expression levels of enzymes involved in estrone and estradiol metabolism. TMEM240 protein expression was observed in normal breast tissues but was not detected in 88.2% (67/76) of breast tumors and in 90.0% (9/10) of metastatic tumors from breast cancer patients. QMSP revealed that in 54.5% (55/101) of Taiwanese breast cancer patients, the methylation level of TMEM240 was at least twofold higher in tumor tissues than in matched normal breast tissues. Patients with hypermethylation of TMEM240 had poor 10-year overall survival (p\u2009=\u20090.003) and poor treatment response, especially hormone therapy response (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Circulating methylated TMEM240 dramatically and gradually decreased and then diminished in patients without disease progression, whereas it returned and its levels in plasma rose again in patients with disease progression. Prediction of disease progression based on circulating methylated TMEM240 was found to have 87.5% sensitivity, 93.1% specificity, and 90.2% accuracy.Hypermethylation of TMEM240 is a potential biomarker for treatment response and disease progression monitoring in breast cancer.",
  "Despite the proportion of elderly breast cancer patients has been consistently increasing, the optimal treatment modalities for this population have not been well explored. We summarized the treatment outcomes of these patients in our hospital.Older patients with early breast cancer were identified from the Breast Cancer Information Management System at West China Hospital, Sichuan University (2000-2019). We compared tumor characteristics and treatment outcomes between the older group (65-74\u2009years old) and the elderly group (\u226575\u2009years old). The Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis were conducted to determine significant prognostic factors.In total, 1094 patients were included. The median follow-up time for this cohort was 59\u2009months. The majority of patients underwent surgery and benefited from surgical treatment. Elderly group patients were less likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy or postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) compared to the older group. However, adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio [HR] 0.521, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.284-0.955, P\u2009=\u20090.035). Subgroup analysis revealed that patients with grade III disease best benefited from adjuvant chemotherapy. PMRT offered a significant improvement in local disease control, but not in OS. Furthermore, endocrine therapy improved the OS of HR-positive patients (HR 0.440, 95%CI 0.261-0.741, P\u2009=\u20090.002), especially for cases aged 65-74\u2009years. Also, receipt of trastuzumab in HER2-positive patients was associated with better OS (HR 0.168, 95%CI 0.029-0.958, P\u2009=\u20090.045).Our findings suggest that surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy, endocrine and targeted therapy are associated with improved OS in older breast cancer patients. Moreover, clinicopathological characteristics should be comprehensively considered when making treatment decisions for these patients.",
  "The availability of HER2-targeted therapy has dramatically improved patient outcome in HER2-positive (HER2+) early breast cancer (EBC) as recently demonstrated by the EBCTCTG metaanalysis on trastuzumab in HER2+ EBC: Adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy has reduced recurrence rates and breast-cancer related mortality by a third [1]. Today, neoadjuvant therapy has become standard of care for women with stage II or III tumors as pathological complete response (pCR) status after surgery can be used to individualize adjuvant systemic therapy. pCR is correlated with favorable patient outcome, particularly in hormone receptor (HR) negative HER2+ EBC, as demonstrated by the FDA meta-analysis. Moreover, for patients with non-pCR, 14 cycles of adjuvant T-DM1 have become a new adjuvant therapy standard based on the results of the KATHERINE trial. Primary surgery can be offered to patients with low tumor burden (cN0 cT1). For this low-risk subgroup, 12 weeks of adjuvant paclitaxel\u00a0+\u00a0trastuzumab for one year are correlated with excellent outcome based on the APT trial results. A multidisciplinary team is essential right from the beginning for optimal locoregional and systemic therapy in such a complex neoadjuvant - adjuvant continuum of care. Clinical trials in HER2+ EBC are currently evaluating further therapy de-escalation in low-risk disease or patients with pCR whereas for patients with non-pCR, escalation trials are also ongoing. Newly approved drugs for HER2+ MBC like tucatinib or trastuzumab-deruxtecan or even immunotherapy combinations are being evaluated to improve upon efficacy of T-DM1 alone in the non-pCR setting. Regarding de-escalation, the WSG ADAPT trial demonstrated feasibility of avoiding overtreatment and individualizing neoadjuvant therapy without compromising outcome. Further de-escalation trials (e.g. DECRESCENDO, COMPASS-HER2) are currently ongoing.",
  "Racial disparities in mortality due to metastasis remain significant among breast cancer patients. Chemokine receptors contribute to breast tumors and metastatic outcome. We explored for significant differences in chemokine receptor expression in breast tumors from Black, Asian, and White patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas. We show that despite sharing the same molecular subtype, expression of the chemokine receptors ACKR1, CCR3, CCR6, CCRL1, CCRL2, CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR4, CXCR6, and CXC3CR1 was significantly different depending on racial group. For patients with triple negative breast cancer, CCR3 was higher in Black versus White and CCRL2 was higher in Asian versus White. In luminal A tumors, ACKR1 was lower in Asian versus White, CCR3 was higher in Black versus White, and CCR6 and CXC3CR1 were lower in Black versus White. In luminal B tumors, CCRL2 was lower in Black versus White, CXCR1 and CXC3CR1 were lower in Asian versus White, and CXCR2 was lower in Black and Asian versus White. In HER2 enriched tumors, CCR3 was higher in Black versus White and CXCR4 lower in Asian versus White. CCR3, CCR6, and CXCR6 associated with worse patient survival. These findings can inform improved treatment strategies to decrease racial disparities in breast cancer burden.",
  "This narrative review analyses the customization of Menopause Hormone Therapy in the context of breast cancer risk in women with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) and with menopause at a normal age. Women with Idiopathic POI, FMR-1 premutation or Turner syndrome, if left untreated, may have lower breast cancer risk compared to the healthy age-matched female population. These women should be treated with MHT until the age of 50, as the risk of breast cancer is equal to that of normally menstruating women. Carriers of BRCA 1 & 2 mutation after risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO), without a personal history of cancer, have an increased breast cancer risk, but may probably be treated with MHT till the age of 50. POI resulting from endometriosis or cancer related treatment is discussed in a separate paper in this issue. In peri- and postmenopausal women with menopausal symptoms and/or risk factors for osteoporosis in need of MHT, the individual breast cancer risk can be evaluated using internet-based calculators. In most women the 5-year-breast cancer risk is low (<3%) and MHT is a safe option. MHT should be prescribed with caution in women who have an intermediate risk (3-6%) and should not be prescribed in those who have a high risk of breast cancer (>6%). Oestrogen-only MHT and oestrogen-progestogen MHT containing micronized progesterone or dydrogesterone are associated with lower breast cancer risk compared to other combined MHT regimens.",
  "This 14-month study aimed to examine the changes of quality of life following breast cancer surgery and associations of such changes with depression and anxiety levels, and protective factors (attachment styles in close relationship, and meaning in life) based on positive psychology theory.Women with breast cancer were recruited within one week of completion of breast cancer surgery. They were asked to complete several questionnaires to measure the generic and breast cancer specific quality of life, depression and anxiety levels, attachment styles in close relationship, and meaning in life. Assessments were performed at baseline (T0), T1 (the 2nd month), T2 (the 5th month), T3 (the 8th month), and T4 (the 14th month).While the generic functions of quality of life improve after surgery, no significant changes of the breast-specific functions were found during the 14-month follow up period. While physical, role, and social functions improved immediately after surgery, the improvements of emotional and cognitive functions began to occur at the 5th and the 8th months after surgery. Depressive symptoms predicted almost all general and breast-specific QOL functions and symptoms. Avoidant and anxious attachment styles were associated with the negative scores for breast-specific functions and symptoms.Breast-specific functions, in particular body image and sexual function, remain unchanged with the passage of time following surgery. A psychological rehabilitation program aiming to reduce depressive symptoms and enhance secure attachment styles in close relationships needs to be established immediately following surgery and continue through the post-treatment survivorship stages.",
  "Pathologic complete response (pCR) rates in early stage HER2-positive breast cancer improved after pertuzumab was added to neoadjuvant treatment. However, survival benefit is less-well established and seems mostly limited to node-positive patients. We used national cancer registry data to compare outcomes of patients treated with and without pertuzumab.We identified stage II-III HER2-positive breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based chemotherapy between November 2013 until January 2016 from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. During that period pertuzumab was only available in the 37 hospitals that participated in the TRAIN-2 study. Missing grade and pCR-status were obtained from the Dutch Pathology Registry (PALGA) and cause of death from Statistics Netherlands. We used multiple imputation to impute missing data, multivariable logistic regression to evaluate the association between pertuzumab and pCR (ypT0/is, ypN0) and multivariable Cox regression models for overall survival and breast cancer specific survival (BCSS).We identified 1124 patients of whom 453 received pertuzumab. Baseline characteristics were comparable, although tumor grade was missing more often in patients treated without pertuzumab (12% vs. 2%). Pertuzumab improved pCR rates (41% vs 65%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.91; 95% CI:2.20-3.94). After a median follow-up of 6.0 years, 5-year BCSS rates were 95% and 98% respectively (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 0.58; 95% CI:0.36-0.95). Younger patients derived more benefit from pertuzumab, but no other significant interactions were found.These results support earlier data of a small survival benefit with the addition of pertuzumab to trastuzumab-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy which is most meaningful in younger patients.",
  "To describe breast cancer treatment patterns among premenopausal women by age and time since last pregnancy.Data were analyzed from 1179 women diagnosed with premenopausal breast cancer in the Carolina Breast Cancer Study. Of these, 160 had a recent pregnancy (within 5\u00a0years of cancer diagnosis). Relative frequency differences (RFDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to compare cancer stage, treatment modality received, treatment initiation delay (>\u200930\u00a0days), and prolonged treatment duration (>\u20092 to\u2009>\u20098\u00a0months depending on the treatment received) by age and recency of pregnancy.Recently postpartum women were significantly more likely to have stage III disease [RFD (95% CI) 12.2% (3.6%, 20.8%)] and to receive more aggressive treatment compared to nulliparous women. After adjustment for age, race and standard clinical tumor characteristics, recently postpartum women were significantly less likely to have delayed treatment initiation [RFD (95% CI) -\u00a011.2% (-\u00a021.4%, -\u00a01.0%)] and prolonged treatment duration [RFD (95% CI) -\u00a017.5% (-\u00a028.0%, -\u00a07.1%)] and were more likely to have mastectomy [RFD (95% CI) 14.9% (4.8%, 25.0%)] compared to nulliparous. Similarly, younger women (<\u200940\u00a0years of age) were significantly less likely to experience prolonged treatment duration [RFD (95% CI) -\u00a05.6% (-\u00a011.1%, -\u00a00.0%)] and more likely to undergo mastectomy [RFD (95% CI) 10.6% (5.2%, 16.0%)] compared to the study population as a whole.These results suggest that recently postpartum and younger women often received prompt and aggressive breast cancer treatment. Higher mortality and recurrence among recently pregnant women are unlikely to be related to undertreatment.",
  "The early months of the COVID-19 pandemic led to reduced cancer screenings and delayed cancer surgeries. We used insurance claims data to understand how breast cancer incidence and treatment after diagnosis changed nationwide over the course of the pandemic.Using the Optum Research Database from January 2017 to March 2021, including approximately 19 million US adults with commercial health insurance, we identified new breast cancer diagnoses and first treatment after diagnosis. We compared breast cancer incidence and proportion of newly diagnosed patients receiving pre-operative systemic therapy pre-COVID, in the first 2 months of the COVID pandemic and in the later part of the COVID pandemic.Average monthly breast cancer incidence was 19.3 (95% CI 19.1-19.5) cases per 100,000 women and men pre-COVID, 11.6 (95% CI 10.8-12.4) per 100,000 in April-May 2020, and 19.7 (95% CI 19.3-20.1) per 100,000 in June 2020-February 2021. Use of pre-operative systemic therapy was 12.0% (11.7-12.4) pre-COVID, 37.7% (34.9-40.7) for patients diagnosed March-April 2020, and 14.8% (14.0-15.7) for patients diagnosed May 2020-January 2021. The changes in breast cancer incidence across the pandemic did not vary by demographic factors. Use of pre-operative systemic therapy across the pandemic varied by geographic region, but not by area socioeconomic deprivation or race/ethnicity.In this US-insured population, the dramatic changes in breast cancer incidence and the use of pre-operative systemic therapy experienced in the first 2 months of the pandemic did not persist, although a modest change in the initial management of breast cancer continued.",
  "Oncological safety of different types and timings of PMBR after breast cancer remains controversial. Lack of stratified risk assessment in literature makes current clinical and shared decision-making complex. This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate differences in oncological outcomes after immediate versus delayed postmastectomy breast reconstruction (PMBR) for autologous and implant-based PMBR separately.A systematic literature search was performed in MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Embase. The Cochrane Collaboration Handbook and Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology checklist were followed for data abstraction. Variability in point estimates attributable to heterogeneity was assessed using I<sup>2</sup> -statistic. (Loco)regional breast cancer recurrence rates, distant metastasis rates, and overall breast cancer recurrence rates were pooled in generalized linear mixed models using random effects.Fifty-five studies, evaluating 14,217 patients, were included. When comparing immediate versus delayed autologous PMBR, weighted average proportions were: 0.03 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.02-0.03) versus 0.02 (95% CI, 0.01-0.04), respectively, for local recurrences, 0.02 (95% CI, 0.01-0.03) versus 0.02 (95% CI, 0.01-0.03) for regional recurrences, and 0.04 (95% CI, 0.03-0.06) versus 0.01 (95% CI, 0.00-0.03) for locoregional recurrences. No statistically significant differences in weighted average proportions for local, regional and locoregional recurrence rates were observed between immediate and delayed autologous PMBR. Data did not allow comparing weighted average proportions of distant metastases and total breast cancer recurrences after autologous PMBR, and of all outcome measures after implant-based PMBR.Delayed autologous PMBR leads to similar (loco)regional breast cancer recurrence rates compared to immediate autologous PMBR. This study highlights the paucity of strong evidence on breast cancer recurrence after specific types and timings of PMBR.Oncologic safety of different types and timings of postmastectomy breast reconstruction (PMBR) remains controversial. Lack of stratified risk assessment in literature makes clinical and shared decision-making complex. This meta-analysis showed that delayed autologous PMBR leads to similar (loco)regional recurrence rates as immediate autologous PMBR. Data did not allow comparing weighted average proportions of distant metastases and total breast cancer recurrence after autologous PMBR, and of all outcome measures after implant-based PMBR. Based on current evidence, oncological concerns do not seem a valid reason to withhold patients from certain reconstructive timings or techniques, and patients should equally be offered all reconstructive options they technically qualify for.",
  "Epidemiologic studies focusing on the association between 1-carbon metabolism-related vitamins (ie, folate, vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, vitamin B<sub>2</sub>, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) and breast cancer risk have reported inconsistent findings. We conducted a systematic search of the reported data and performed a meta-analysis of prospective case-control and cohort studies to derive a more precise evaluation. The PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched to identify eligible studies. A total of 27 studies involving 49,707 cases and 1,274,060 individuals were included in the meta-analysis. The results indicated that a high intake of folate, vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, and vitamin B<sub>2</sub> might decrease the risk of breast cancer. The corresponding pooled relative risks (RRs) for the highest intake compared with the lowest were 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88-0.99; P\u00a0= .018), 0.94 (95% CI, 0.89-1.00; P\u00a0= .037) and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.82-0.99; P\u00a0= .026). No significant association between vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and breast cancer risk was found (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.94-1.04; P\u00a0= .604). Further study showed that folate and vitamin B<sub>6</sub> might decrease the risk of estrogen receptor-negative (ER<sup>-</sup>)/progesterone receptor-negative (PR<sup>-</sup>) breast cancer but not ER<sup>+</sup>/PR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer. The dose-response meta-analysis indicated a significant linearity relationship between folate intake and a reduced risk of ER<sup>-</sup>/PR<sup>-</sup> breast cancer. An increment of folate intake (100 \u03bcg/d) corresponded to a 7% deceased risk of ER<sup>-</sup>/PR<sup>-</sup> breast cancer (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.89-0.98; P\u00a0=\u00a0.007). In conclusion, a high intake of 1-carbon metabolism-related vitamins might contribute to the prevention of breast cancer, especially ER<sup>-</sup>/PR<sup>-</sup> breast cancer.",
  "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted breast cancer control through short-term declines in screening and delays in diagnosis and treatments. We projected the impact of COVID-19 on future breast cancer mortality between 2020 and 2030.Three established Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network breast cancer models modeled reductions in mammography screening use, delays in symptomatic cancer diagnosis, and reduced use of chemotherapy for women with early-stage disease for the first 6 months of the pandemic with return to prepandemic patterns after that time. Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the effect of key model parameters, including the duration of the pandemic impact.By 2030, the models project 950 (model range = 860-1297) cumulative excess breast cancer deaths related to reduced screening, 1314 (model range = 266-1325) associated with delayed diagnosis of symptomatic cases, and 151 (model range = 146-207) associated with reduced chemotherapy use in women with hormone positive, early-stage cancer. Jointly, 2487 (model range = 1713-2575) excess breast cancer deaths were estimated, representing a 0.52% (model range = 0.36%-0.56%) cumulative increase over breast cancer deaths expected by 2030 in the absence of the pandemic's disruptions. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the breast cancer mortality impact would be approximately double if the modeled pandemic effects on screening, symptomatic diagnosis, and chemotherapy extended for 12\u2009months.Initial pandemic-related disruptions in breast cancer care will have a small long-term cumulative impact on breast cancer mortality. Continued efforts to ensure prompt return to screening and minimize delays in evaluation of symptomatic women can largely mitigate the effects of the initial pandemic-associated disruptions.",
  "In the present study, we have explored the prognostic value of the Phosphofructokinase Platelet-type (PFKP) expression and its therapeutic relevance in metastatic breast cancer. PFKP immunohistochemistry was performed on Invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCs; n\u00a0=\u00a087) of breast, and its association with clinicopathological parameters were evaluated. Using online meta-analysis tools, PFKP's prognostic value was investigated in overall breast cancer as well as in triple negative subtype (TNBCs). For in vitro analysis, MDA-MB-231\u00a0cells model was used in order to elucidate mechanisms behind PFKP regulated glycolysis and its impact on cancer cell physiology. Therapeutic relevance of PFKP was further evaluated using PFKP siRNA and Quercetin. PFKP protein expression was found to be positively associated with nodal invasion (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009), receptor (ER & PR) negative status (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005 & p\u00a0=\u00a00.028) and reduced overall survival in breast cancer patients (p\u00a0=\u00a00.014). In MDA-MB-231\u00a0cells, quercetin treatment impaired PFKP-LDHA signaling axis thereby inhibiting aerobic glycolysis mediated increased migration of cancer cells. Our present study demonstrates that elevated PFKP levels are associated with basal cells/TNBC subtypes and might serve as prognostic indicator for TNBC patients. Ability of quercetin to inhibit aerobic glycolysis, cell migration and clonogenic potential of malignant breast cancer cells advocates possibility of quercetin in aggressive breast cancer treatment.",
  "It is estimated that 5-10% of breast cancer cases are hereditary. The identification of pathogenic germline variants allows individualized preventive health care, improvement of clinical management and genetic counseling. Studies in ethnically admixed Latin American populations have identified regions with increased frequency of deleterious variants in breast cancer predisposing genes. In this context, the Brazilian population exhibits great genetic heterogeneity, and is not well represented in international databases, which makes it difficult to interpret the clinical relevance of germline variants.We evaluated the frequency of pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) germline variants in up to 37 breast cancer predisposing genes, in a cohort of 105 breast and/or ovarian cancer Brazilian women referred to two research centers between 2014 and\u00a02019.A total of 22 patients (21%) were found to carry P/LP variants, and 16 VUS were detected in 15 patients (14.3%). Additionally, a novel pathogenic ATM intragenic deletion was identified in an early-onset breast cancer. We also detected a BRCA1 pathogenic variant (c.5074+2T>C) in higher frequency (10\u00d7) than in other studies with similar cohorts.Our findings contribute to the characterization of the genetic background of breast cancer predisposition in the Brazilian population as a useful resource to discriminate between deleterious variants and VUS, thus enabling improvement in the preventive health care and clinical management of carriers.",
  "<b>Objective:</b> To explore the efficacy and safety of real-world eribulin in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. <b>Methods:</b> From December 2019 to December 2020, patients with advanced breast cancer were selected from Beijing Chaoyang District Sanhuan Cancer Hospital, Shandong Cancer Hospital, Peking University Cancer Hospital, Baotou Cancer Hospital, Shengjing Hospital Affiliated to China Medical University, and Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Kaplan-Meier method and Log rank test were used for survival analysis, and Cox regression model was used for multivariate analysis. <b>Results:</b> The median progression-free survival (PFS) of 77 patients was 5 months, the objective response rate (ORR) was 33.8%, and the disease control rate (DCR) was 71.4%. The ORR of patients with triple-negative breast cancer was 23.1%, and the DCR was 57.7%; the ORR of patients with Luminal breast cancer was 40.0%, and the DCR was 77.8%; the ORR of patients with HER-2 overexpression breast cancer was 33.3%, and the DCR was 83.3%. ORR of 50.0% and DCR of 66.7% for patients treated with eribulin as first to second line treatment, ORR of 29.4% and DCR of 76.5% for patients treated with third to fourth line and ORR of 28.6% and DCR of 71.4% for patients treated with five to eleven line. The ORR of patients in the eribulin monotherapy group was 40.0% and the DCR was 66.0%; the ORR of patients in the combination chemotherapy or targeted therapy group was 22.2% and the DCR was 81.5%. Patients with a history of treatment with paclitaxel, docetaxel, or albumin paclitaxel during the adjuvant phase or after recurrent metastasis had an ORR of 32.9% and a DCR of 69.9% when treated with eribulin. The treatment efficacy is an independent prognostic factor affecting patient survival (<i>P</i><0.001). The main adverse reactions in the whole group of patients were Grade \u2162-\u2163 neutrophil decline [29.9% (23/77)], and other adverse reactions were Grade \u2162-\u2163 fatigue [5.2% (4/77)], Grade \u2162-\u2163 peripheral nerve abnormality [2.6% (2/77)] and Grade \u2162-\u2163 alopecia [2.6% (2/77)]. <b>Conclusions:</b> Eribulin still has good antitumor activity against various molecular subtypes of breast cancer and advanced breast cancer that has failed multiple lines of chemotherapy, and the adverse effects can be controlled, so it has a good clinical application value.",
  "Advanced breast cancer is a complicated disease with poor prognosis, which is difficult for salvage treatment. Although advanced breast cancer is difficult to cure at present, we can improve the life quality and prolong survival time of patients by applying optimized treatment. In recent years, with the rapid development of molecular biology and gene testing technology, studies on advanced breast cancer continue to deepen. Gene targeted therapy significantly extends the survival time of patients with advanced breast cancer. Gene testing is one of the important means for molecular typing, genetic diagnosis, therapeutic monitoring, drug resistance, and treatment choice of breast cancer, which is of great significance for the selection of targeted drugs and the management plan. In this consensus, the Expert Committee summarized ten hot issues of gene testing for advanced breast cancer and discussed the applicable population, clinical significance, and the application of molecular markers circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), whole exome sequencing (WES) in different molecular types, and the standardization of next generation sequencing (NGS) technology applied in clinic. This consensus aimed to guide clinicians how to rationally apply the gene testing to know more comprehensive genetic testing information, and formulate more precise treatment strategies for patients with advanced breast cancer.",
  "The increasing incidence rate of breast cancer in the last few decades is known to be linked to the upward trend of obesity prevalence worldwide. The consumption of high-fat diet in particular has been correlated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk. The underlying mechanisms, using suitable and reliable experimental mouse model, however, is lacking. The current review aims to discuss the evidence available from mouse models on the effects of dietary fats intake on postmenopausal breast cancer. We will further discuss the biochemical mechanisms involved in the occurrence of postmenopausal breast cancer. In addition, the methodological considerations and their limitations in obesity-related postmenopausal breast cancer, such as choice of mouse models and breast cancer cell lines as well as the study duration will be reviewed. The current review will provide a platform for further development of new xenograft models which may offer the opportunity to investigate the mechanisms of postmenopausal breast cancer in a greater detail.",
  "Metastatic breast cancer is a major cause of cancer-related deaths in woman. Brain metastasis is a common and devastating site of relapse for several breast cancer molecular subtypes, including oestrogen receptor-positive disease, with life expectancy of less than a year. While efforts have been devoted to developing therapeutics for extra-cranial metastasis, drug penetration of blood-brain barrier (BBB) remains a major clinical challenge. Defining molecular alterations in breast cancer brain metastasis enables the identification of novel actionable targets.Global transcriptomic analysis of matched primary and metastatic patient tumours (n\u2009=\u200935 patients, 70 tumour samples) identified a putative new actionable target for advanced breast cancer which was further validated in vivo and in breast cancer patient tumour tissue (n\u2009=\u2009843 patients). A peptide mimetic of the target's natural ligand was designed in silico and its efficacy assessed in in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models of breast cancer metastasis.Bioinformatic analysis of over-represented pathways in metastatic breast cancer identified ADAM22 as a top ranked member of the ECM-related druggable genome specific to brain metastases. ADAM22 was validated as an actionable target in in vitro, ex vivo and in patient tumour tissue (n\u2009=\u2009843 patients). A peptide mimetic of the ADAM22 ligand LGI1, LGI1MIM, was designed in silico. The efficacy of LGI1MIM and its ability to penetrate the BBB were assessed in vitro, ex vivo and in brain metastasis BBB 3D biometric biohybrid models, respectively. Treatment with LGI1MIM in vivo inhibited disease progression, in particular the development of brain metastasis.ADAM22 expression in advanced breast cancer supports development of breast cancer brain metastasis. Targeting ADAM22 with a peptide mimetic LGI1MIM represents a new therapeutic option to treat metastatic brain disease.",
  "Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease highly diverse in different subtypes, including hormone receptor positive and hormone receptor negative subtypes with variable malignancy, therapy regimen, and different prognosis. In this study, we develop a hormone receptor-specific mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA ceRNA network to identify whether several RNAs play fundamental roles in development and metastasis of breast cancer. To understand the association of ceRNA expression profiles in different breast cancer subgroups, the expression profiles and clinical information of 428 HR+/Her-2- breast cancer samples and 113 triple negative breast cancer samples were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA). We comprehensively integrated and compared expression profiles of mRNAs, miRNAs, and lncRNAs between the two subgroups mentioned. Aberrantly expressed hormone receptor specific RNAs were identified, whereas lncRNA-miRNA interactions predicted by miRcode and miRNA-targeted mRNA interactions were validated by miRTarBase, Targetscan, and miRDB database. In this study, mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA ceRNA network was constructed that consisted of 44 miRNA-lncRNA interaction pairs and 2 miRNA-mRNA interaction pairs, and visualized by Cytoscape software. Prognostic markers of HR-specific subtype of breast cancer associated with overall survival were identified by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Finally, SFRP1, AC006449.1, and MUC2 were novel clinical predictors that may also provide a new therapeutic target in the future.",
  "Beta blockers (BB) have been associated with improved, worsened, or unchanged breast cancer outcomes in previous studies. This study examines the association between the post-diagnostic use of BBs and death from breast cancer in a large, representative sample of New Zealand (NZ) women with breast cancer.Women diagnosed with a first primary breast cancer between 2007 and 2016 were identified from four population-based regional NZ breast cancer registries and linked to national pharmaceutical data, hospital discharges, and death records. The median follow-up time was 4.51\u00a0years. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the hazard of breast cancer-specific death (BCD) associated with any post-diagnostic BB use.Of the 14,976 women included in analyses, 21% used a BB after diagnosis. BB use (vs non-use) was associated with a small and nonstatistically significant increased risk of BCD (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.11; 95% CI 0.95-1.29). A statistically significant increased risk confined to short-term use (0-3\u00a0months) was seen (HR\u2009=\u20091.40; 1.14-1.73), and this risk steadily decreased with increasing duration of use and became a statistically significant protective effect at 3\u2009+\u2009years of use (HR\u2009=\u20090.55; 0.34-0.88).Our findings suggest that any increased risk associated with BB use may be driven by risk in the initial few months of use. Long-term BB use may be associated with a reduction in BCD.",
  "Cancer survivors who develop breast cancer as a second malignancy (BCa-2) are common. Yet, little is known about the prognosis of BCa-2 compared to first primary breast cancer (BCa-1).Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, we conducted a population-based cohort study including 883,881 patients with BCa-1 and 36,313 patients with BCa-2 during 1990-2015. Compared with patients with BCa-1, we calculated hazard ratios (HRs) of breast cancer-specific mortality among patients with BCa-2, using multivariable Cox regression.During the follow-up (median 5.5\u2009years), 114,964 and 3829 breast cancer-specific deaths were identified among BCa-1 and BCa-2 patients, respectively. Patients with BCa-2 had more favorable tumor characteristics and received less intensive treatment e.g., surgery and chemo-/radio-therapy, compared to patients with BCa-1. When adjusting for demographic factors, patients with BCa-2 were at similar risk of breast cancer-specific mortality (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97-1.03) compared to patients with BCa-1. However, when additionally controlling for tumor characteristics and treatment modes, BCa-2 patients were at an increased risk of breast cancer-specific mortality (HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.08-1.15). The risk elevation was particularly greater when the first malignancy was lung, bladder, ovarian or blood malignancy (HRs 1.16-1.85), or when the first malignancy was treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.28-1.63).Overall, patients with BCa-2 have worse breast cancer-specific survival, compared with their BCa-1 counterparts, although the risk elevation is mild. High-risk subgroups based on first malignancy's characteristics may be considered for active clinical management.",
  "Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) has a dual function in breast cancer, having a tumor suppressor activity in early carcinomas while enhancing tumor metastasis in advanced breast carcinoma. Consequently, the prognostic role of TGF\u03b2 and its signaling cascade in breast cancer remain unclear.To investigate the relationship between T\u03b2RII expression, clinic-pathological characteristics, and prognostic significance of T\u03b2RII expression in clinical stage III breast cancer.Biopsy from the primary tumor was obtained from 30 newly diagnosed clinical stage III breast cancer patients before receiving any therapy. Expression of T\u03b2RII, ER, PR, Her2 and Ki-67 was assessed by immunohistochemistry.T\u03b2RII expression was positive in 66.7% of cases and was significantly associated with advanced nodal stage and distant metastases. After a median follow up of 42.3 months, T\u03b2RII was associated with poor disease-free survival and it was an independent factor for predicting the poor outcome for breast cancer patients, especially in node positive tumors, ER/PR positive and Her2-negative tumors.These findings suggest the usage of therapeutic drugs that target TGF\u03b2 in advanced breast cancer patients may be effective. Nevertheless, blockage of the tumor promoting and sparing of the tumor suppressor effect of TGF\u03b2 pathway should be taken into consideration. We suggest that these therapies might have more benefit in ER and PR positive tumors.",
  "Young premenopausal women with breast cancer often experience more aggressive disease biology and poorer survival than older women. Diagnostic and therapeutic advances, including human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-directed therapy, may lessen treatment burden and improve survival for these young women, but contemporary incidence and survival data by HER2 status are limited.We identified women aged 20-49 years (n\u00a0= 68,530) diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer during 2010-2016 from the United States Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 18 registries database. Age-adjusted average annual percent changes in incidence (diagnosis 2010-2016) and 5-year Kaplan-Meier survival curves (diagnosis 2010-2015) were estimated by HER2 and hormone receptor (HR) status and stratified independently by cancer stage and race/ethnicity.With increasing age decade, proportions of HER2<sup>-</sup>/HR<sup>+</sup> cancer increased, whereas proportions of HER2<sup>+</sup>/HR<sup>+</sup>, HER2<sup>+</sup>/HR<sup>-</sup>, and HER2<sup>-</sup>/HR<sup>-</sup> decreased. The greatest increases in incidence during 2010-2016 were observed for HER2<sup>+</sup> among women aged 20-49 years and HER2<sup>-</sup>/HR<sup>-</sup> among women aged 20-29 years. Incidence decreased for HER2<sup>-</sup>/HR<sup>-</sup> among women aged 40-49 years. Five-year survival was lowest for HER2<sup>-</sup>/HR<sup>-</sup> status compared to other receptor-based subtypes among women aged 20-49 years. HER2<sup>+</sup> status was more beneficial for 5-year survival than HR<sup>+</sup> status among women aged 20-29 years, with the opposite observed among women aged 30-49 years, particularly those aged 40-49 years.HER2<sup>+</sup> breast cancer increased among premenopausal women and was also associated with higher early survival within each HR status. HER2<sup>-</sup>/HR<sup>-</sup> cancer also increased among women aged 20-29 years and was associated with lower early survival. Our contemporary data provide important insights to help inform preventive and therapeutic strategies for premenopausal women.",
  "Breast cancer, the most prevalent malignancy in women, is also the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide. The activation of the Wnt pathway plays a pivotal role in the metastatic abilities of breast cancer. In this study, IL1F6, MRGPRX1, and SEC14L3 were significantly correlated to breast cancer patients'overall survival based on TCGA-BRCA dataset. Although IL1F6, MRGPRX1 and SEC14L3 high expression were associated with better survival in breast cancer patients, SEC14L3 had the biggest survival benefit for breast cancer; therefore, SEC14L3 was selected for the subsequent investigation. SEC14L3 mRNA expression and protein levels within breast cancer cell lines decreased compared with normal human breast epithelial cells. Overexpressing SEC14L3 in breast cancer cells inhibited the malignant phenotypes of cancer cells, including the capacity of cells to migrate and invade. SEC14L3 overexpression decreased the levels of mesenchymal markers, whereas SEC14L3 knockdown facilitated the malignant behaviors of breast cancer cells. SEC14L3 overexpression also inhibited Wnt/\u03b2-catenin activation. The Wnt agonist strengthened the malignant phenotypes of breast cancer cells; moreover, the anti-tumor effects of SEC14L3 overexpression were partially attenuated by the Wnt agonist. Conclusively, SEC14L3, which is underexpressed in breast cancer cells and tissues, could play a tumor-suppressive role in a Wnt/\u03b2-catenin-related way.",
  "The association between polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and breast cancer remains inconclusive. Conventional observational studies are susceptible to inverse causality and potential confounders. With a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, we aimed to investigate the causal relationship between genetically predicted PCOS and breast cancer risk.Our study included 11 PCOS-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms as instrumental variables identified by the latest genome-wide association study. Individual-level genetic summary data of participants were obtained from the Breast Cancer Association\u00a0Consortium, with a total of 122,977 cases and 105,974 controls. The inverse-variance weighted method was applied to estimate the causality between genetically predicted PCOS and breast cancer risk. To further evaluate the pleiotropy, the weighted median and MR-Egger regression methods were implemented as well.Our study demonstrated that genetically predicted PCOS was causally associated with an increased risk of overall breast cancer (odds ratio (OR)\u2009=\u20091.07; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.12, p\u2009=\u20090.005). The subgroup analyses according to immunohistochemical type further illustrated that genetically predicted PCOS was associated with an increased risk of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer (OR\u2009=\u20091.09; 95% CI 1.03-1.15, p\u2009=\u20090.002), while no causality was observed for ER-negative breast cancer (OR\u2009=\u20091.02; 95% CI 0.96-1.09, p\u2009=\u20090.463). In addition, no pleiotropy was found in our study.Our findings indicated that PCOS was likely to be a causal factor in the development of ER-positive breast cancer, providing a better understanding for the etiology of breast cancer and the prevention of breast cancer.",
  "Second-line endocrine therapy (ET) for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is offered based on the response to first-line ET. However, no clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy and safety of secondary ETs in patients with poor responses to initial ET. This study evaluated the efficacy of second-line ET in ER-positive and HER2-negative postmenopausal MBC patients with low or very low sensitivity to initial ET.This multicenter prospective observational cohort study evaluated the response of 49 patients to second-line ETs in postmenopausal MBC patients with low or very low sensitivity to initial ET. The primary endpoint was the clinical benefit rate (CBR) for 24\u00a0weeks.Of the 49 patients assessed, 40 (82%) received fulvestrant in the second line, 5 (10%) received selective estrogen receptor modulators, 3 (6%) received aromatase inhibitors (AIs) alone, and 1 received everolimus with a steroidal AI. The overall CBR was 44.9% [90% confidence interval (CI): 34.6-57.6, p\u2009=\u20090.009]; CBR demonstrated similar significance across the progesterone receptor-positive (n\u2009=\u200939, 51.3%, 90% CI: 39.6-65.2, p\u2009=\u20090.002), very low sensitivity (n\u2009=\u200917, 58.8%, 90% CI: 42.0-78.8, p\u2009=\u20090.003), and non-visceral metastases (n\u2009=\u200925, 48.0%, 90% CI: 34.1-65.9, p\u2009=\u20090.018) groups. The median progression-free survival was 7.1\u00a0months (95% CI: 5.6-10.6).Second-line ET might be a viable treatment option for postmenopausal patients with MBC with low and very low sensitivity to initial ET. Future studies based on larger and independent cohorts are needed to validate these findings.",
  "We aimed to examine the safety and efficacy of bevacizumab and carboplatin in patients with breast cancer brain metastases.We enrolled patients with breast cancer and >\u00a01 measurable new or progressive brain metastasis. Patients received bevacizumab 15\u2009mg/kg intravenously (IV) on cycle 1 day 1 and carboplatin IV AUC\u2009=\u20095 on cycle 1 day 8. Patients with HER2-positive disease also received trastuzumab. In subsequent cycles, all drugs were administered on day 1 of each cycle. Contrast-enhanced brain MRI was performed at baseline, 24-96\u2009h after the first bevacizumab dose (day +\u20091), and every 2\u2009cycles. The primary endpoint was objective response rate in the central nervous system (CNS ORR) by composite criteria. Associations between germline VEGF single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs699947, rs2019063, rs1570360, rs833061) and progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were explored, as were associations between early (day +\u20091) MRI changes and outcomes.Thirty-eight patients were enrolled (29 HER2-positive, 9 HER2-negative); all were evaluable for response. The CNS ORR was 63% (95% CI, 46-78). Median PFS was 5.62\u2009months and median OS was 14.10\u2009months. As compared with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0, patients with ECOG PS 1-2 had significantly worse PFS and OS (all P\u2009<\u20090.01). No significant associations between VEGF genotypes or early MRI changes and clinical outcomes were observed.The combination of bevacizumab and carboplatin results in a high rate of durable objective response in patients with brain metastases from breast cancer. This regimen warrants further investigation.NCT01004172 . Registered 28 October 2009.",
  "In addition to TNM-based anatomical staging (AS), a novel pathological prognostic staging (PPS) has been proposed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC). PPS demonstrated better prognostication, but its superiority in breast cancer subtypes and related to staging discrepancies between AS and PPS are not clear.A cohort of 1729 patients with breast cancer was staged into AS and PPS according to the latest AJCC staging. Patient characteristic and restaging outcomes were compared.Compared with AS, 799 and 135 cases were upstaged and downstaged respectively in PPS, mostly involved stage I cases. For the overall cohort, PPS demonstrated superior prognostic power over AS in both disease-free survival (DFS) and breast cancer-specific survival. However, such superiority was found mainly in estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR)+ but not ER-PR- cancers. Comparing the restaged cases within the same PPS, PPS 1A cases showed similar survival irrespective of the original AS. Interestingly, in other PPS groups (PPS 1B and higher), there was a difference in outcome among patients with same PPS but different AS. Within PPS 1B patients, downstaged cases from higher AS showed worse DFS (3A>1B vs. 2A>1B: \u03c7<sup>2</sup>\u00a0= 4.732, P\u00a0= .030).PPS may provide a more accurate prognostication, mostly among ER/PR+ cancers and with PPS 1A patients. Patients restaged to higher PPS stages showed significant differential survival even within the same PPS. Also, only limited improvement was observed for ER-PR- cancers. Caution needs to be exercised in using PPS for patient prognostication, as in some cases the outcome can be variable with the same PPS.",
  "Physical limitations prior to cancer diagnosis may lead to suboptimal health outcomes. Our objective was to evaluate the impacts of poor physical health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and physical functioning (PF) on the risk of contralateral breast cancer (CBC).We performed a nested case-control study of women with invasive unilateral breast cancer (UBC) who did not receive prophylactic contralateral mastectomy using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Medicare Health Outcomes Survey data resource. Among 2938 women aged\u2009\u2265\u200965\u00a0years diagnosed with first stage I-III UBC between 1997 and 2011, we identified 100 subsequent CBC cases and 915 matched controls without CBC using incidence density sampling\u00a0without replacement. Pre-diagnosis physical HRQOL and PF were determined using Medical Outcomes Trust Short Form-36 (SF-36)/Veterans Rand 12-Item Health Survey (VR-12) responses within 2\u00a0years prior to first UBC diagnosis. We estimated adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using conditional logistic regression models.Cases and controls were similar with respect to comorbidities, stage, surgery, and radiation treatments, but differed by hormone receptor status (ER/PR-negative, 23% and 11%, respectively) of first UBC. Cases had modestly lower mean pre-diagnosis physical HRQOL (-\u00a01.8) and PF (-\u00a02.2) scores. In multivariable models, we observed an increased CBC risk associated with low physical HRQOL (lowest vs. highest quartile, OR\u2009=\u20091.8; 95% CI 0.8-4.3), but CIs included 1.0. Low PF was associated with a 2.7-fold (95% CI 1.1-6.7) increased CBC risk.Findings indicate that low physical HRQOL, specifically poor PF, is associated with CBC risk. Efforts to understand and minimize declines in PF post-breast cancer are well motivated.",
  "In this study, the role of change in tumor stiffness between pre- and post-two cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) measured by Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) imaging for predicting the response to NACT in breast cancer was analyzed.Fifty-two adult women with biopsy-proven locally advanced breast cancer and early-stage breast cancer who received NACT followed by either modified radical mastectomy or breast conservation surgery were included in the study. Tumor stiffness represented by shear wave velocity (SWV) in meter per second by ARFI imaging was measured before and after two cycles of NACT. Participants were categorized into responders and nonresponders based on pathological response assessment from the postoperative specimen. The association of change in tumor stiffness between pre- and post-two cycles of NACT with final pathological response status was assessed.The mean change in SWV before and after completion of two cycles of NACT was 0.42\u2009\u00b1\u20090.16 and 0.17\u2009\u00b1\u20090.11\u2009m/s in responders and nonresponders, respectively, and this difference was proven to be statistically significant (p\u2009<\u20090.001) suggesting that tumors that exhibit a larger reduction in tumor stiffness, respond better. An SWV reduction cut-off of 0.295\u2009m/s between baseline and post-two cycles of NACT was also arrived at, which can discriminate between responders and nonresponders with a sensitivity and specificity of 88% and 83%, respectively.Difference in tumor stiffness measured by ARFI imaging before and after two cycles of chemotherapy can be used as a reliable early predictor of response to chemotherapy in breast cancer.",
  "Long-term follow-up data from multicenter phase III non-inferiority trials confirmed the safety of omission of axillary dissection in selected patients with clinically node-negative, sentinel node-positive breast cancer. Several ongoing trials investigate extended eligibility of the Z0011 protocol in the adjuvant setting. De-escalation of axillary surgery in patients with clinically node-positive breast cancer is currently limited to the neoadjuvant setting, where the sentinel procedure is used to determine nodal pathological complete response. Targeted axillary dissection lowers the false-negative rate of the sentinel procedure, which, however, is consistently associated with a very low risk of axillary recurrence in several recent single-center series. Axillary dissection remains standard care in patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy while the results of Alliance A011202 are pending. The TAXIS trial investigates the role of tailored axillary surgery in patients with clinically node-positive breast cancer, a novel concept designed to selectively remove positive nodes in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting.",
  "Data from recently published trials have provided practice-changing recommendations for the surgical approach to the axilla in breast cancer. Patients with T1-2 lesions, treated with breast conservation, who have not received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and have 1-2 positive sentinel nodes (Z0011-criteria) may avoid axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). We aim to describe the dissemination of this practice in Europe over an extended period of time.Our source of data was the eusomaDB, a central data warehouse of prospectively collected information of the European Society of Breast Cancer Specialists (EUSOMA). We identified cases fulfilling Z0011-criteria from 2005 to 2016 from 34 European breast centers and report trends in ALND. Data derived from Germany, Italy, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, and Netherlands.6671 patients fulfilled Z0011-criteria. Rates of ALND showed a statistically significant decrease from 2010 (89%) to 2011 (73%), reaching 46% in 2016 (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). After multivariable analysis, factors associated with higher probability of ALND were earlier year of surgery, younger age, increasing tumor size and grade, and being operated in Italy (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). The minimum and maximal rates of ALND in the most recent two-year period (2015-2016) were 0% and 83% in two centers located in different countries (p\u202f<\u202f0.001).Our study demonstrates, a decrease in rates of ALND that started after year 2010 through the end of the study period. Wide differences were observed among centers and countries indicating the need to spread unified clinical guidelines in Europe to allow for homogeneous evidence-based practice patterns.",
  "LncRNA MEG3 expressed abnormally in various cancers including breast cancer, but no studies reported the correlation between MEG3 SNPs and breast cancer susceptibility among Chinese women.This study is aimed to explore the association between three SNPs of MEG3 (rs3087918, rs7158663, rs11160608) and breast cancer. The study is a population-based case-control study including 434 breast cancer patients and 700 healthy controls. Genotyping was performed using Sequenom MassArray technique. Function prediction of rs3087918 were based on RNAfold and lncRNASNP2 databases.Pooled analysis indicated that rs3087918 was related to a decreased risk of breast cancer [GG vs. TT: OR (95%)\u2009=\u20090.67(0.45-0.99), P\u2009=\u20090.042; GG vs. TT\u2009+\u2009TG: OR (95%)\u2009=\u20090.69(0.48-0.99), P\u2009=\u20090.046], especially for women aged <=49 [GG vs. TT: OR (95%)\u2009=\u20090.40(0.22-0.73), P\u2009=\u20090.02]. Comparison between case groups showed genotype GG and TG/GG of rs3087918 were associated with her-2 receptor expression [GG vs. TT: OR (95%)\u2009=\u20092.37(1.24-4.63), P\u2009=\u20090.010; TG\u2009+\u2009GG vs. TT: OR (95%)\u2009=\u20091.50(1.01-2.24), P\u2009=\u20090.045]. We didn't find statistical significance for rs11160608, rs7158663 and breast cancer. Structure prediction based on RNAfold found rs3087918 may influence the secondary structure of MEG3. The results based on lncRNASNP2 indicated that rs3087918 may gain the targets of hsa-miR-1203 to MEG3, while loss the target of hsa-miR-139-3p and hsa-miR-5091 to MEG3.MEG3 rs3087918 was associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer. MEG3 haplotype TCG may increase the risk of breast cancer.",
  "Radiologic screening for breast cancer is performed with the goal of diagnosing the disease at an earlier stage, thus reducing morbidity and mortality. Screening recommendations for women at higher than average risk for breast cancer differ from those of women with an average risk, and include yearly breast MRI and mammography starting at a young age.Review the morbidity and mortality, and check whether the goal of early diagnosis was achieved in the participants of the High-Risk Ontario Breast Screening Program at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Ontario Canada.A prospective cohort study was conducted of 2,081 women participating in the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre high risk screening program 2011-2018. Demographic, imaging, and if applicable biopsies, diagnosis and treatment data were captured in a prospectively maintained database starting with each participant's enrolment in the program.A total of 32% of the participants were carriers of pathogenic variants in breast cancer related genes (BRCA, NF, CHEK2, TP53 etc.), 8% had a history of therapeutic chest radiotherapy, and the remaining 60% had a calculated elevated lifetime risk based on family history or personal risk factors, without an identifiable pathogenic mutation or previous radiation. During the follow-up period 89 breast cancer cases were diagnosed at the median age of 49 years. Median tumor size at diagnosis was 0.9 cm, correlating with a T1 disease. Nodal disease was found only in 4 cases. Breast cancer incidence was the same in the mutation carriers and chest radiotherapy groups, but 3-fold lower in the third group. Diagnosis of breast cancer was most commonly conducted by MRI imaging, and only 6% of cases were diagnosed based solely on mammography findings. Furthermore, 38 women died during follow-up, 29 of them (76%) were BRCA carriers who died from ovarian carcinoma.Diagnosis at an early stage was achieved in this cohort of women followed in the high risk screening program. Most cases were diagnosed by MRI, thus emphasizing the importance of identifying women at high risk for breast cancer and referring them to the appropriate screening program.",
  "Existence of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) is implicated in disease relapse, metastasis, and resistance of treatment. \u03b21,3-Galactosyltransferase 5 (B3GALT5) has been shown to be a pro-survival marker for BCSCs. However, little is known about the prognostic significance of B3GALT5 in breast cancer.Paired tissues (tumor part and adjacent non-tumor part) from a cohort of 202 women with breast cancer were used to determine the expression levels of B3GALT5 mRNA by qRT-PCR. Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess survival differences in terms of relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Both breast cancer cells and cancer stem cells (BCSCs) were used to see the in vitro effects of knockdown or overexpression of B3GALT5 on cell migration, invasion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). A patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model was used to see the in vivo effects of knockdown of B3GALT5 in BCSCs on tumor growth and metastasis.Higher expression of B3GALT5 in 202 breast cancer tissues, especially in adjacent non-tumor tissue, correlated with poor clinical outcomes including shorter OS and RFS in all patients, especially those with early stage breast cancer. In vitro studies showed B3GALT5 could enhance cell migration, invasion, mammosphere formation, and EMT. Of note, B3GALT5 upregulated the expression of \u03b2-catenin and EMT activator zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) pathway in BCSCs. In vivo studies showed B3GALT5 expression in BCSCs is critical for not only tumor growth but also lymph node and lung metastasis in PDX mice.Our results demonstrated the value of B3GALT5 as a prognostic marker of breast cancer, especially among the early stage patients, and its crucial roles in regulating EMT, cell migration, and stemness thereby promoting breast cancer progression.",
  "A cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor, palbociclib, has been used to treat patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 2-negative (-) advanced breast cancer. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the antitumor activity of palbociclib, we conducted a preclinical study on the anti-cell growth and anti-cancer stem cell (CSC) activity of palbociclib in breast cancer cells.The effects of palbociclib on Rb phosphorylation, cell growth, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, cell senescence and the proportion of CSCs were investigated in five human breast cancer cell lines of different subtypes. To investigate the mechanisms of the anti-CSC activity of palbociclib, small-interfering RNAs for CDK4 and/or CDK6 were used. Palbociclib dose-dependently reduced Rb phosphorylation and cell growth in association with G1-S cell cycle blockade and the induction of cell senescence, but without increased apoptosis, in all breast cancer cell lines.The anti-cell growth activity of palbociclib widely differed among the cell lines. Palbociclib also dose-dependently reduced the CSC proportion measured by three different assays in four of five cell lines. The inhibition of CDK4 expression, but not CDK6 expression, reduced the increased proportion of putative CSCs induced by estradiol in ER (+)/HER2 (-) cell lines.These results suggest that palbociclib exhibits significant anti-cell growth and anti-CSC activity in not only ER (+) breast cancer cell lines but also ER (-) cell lines. CDK4 inhibition induced by palbociclib may be responsible for its anti-CSC activity.",
  "To study the impact of subtypes and comorbidities on breast cancer (BC) relapse and survival in the heterogeneous patients of the real world.We identified patients diagnosed with BC between January 2003 and December 2005 from six population-based Swiss cancer registries. Clinicopathologic data was completed with information on locoregional and distant relapse and date and cause of death for over 10-years. We approximated BC subtypes using grade and the immunohistochemical panel for oestrogen, progesterone and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) receptor status. We studied factors affecting relapse and survival.Luminal A-like subtype represented 46% of all newly diagnosed BC (N\u202f=\u202f1831), followed by luminal B-like (N\u202f=\u202f1504, 38%), triple negative (N\u202f=\u202f436, 11%) and HER2 enriched (N\u202f=\u202f204, 5%). We observed regional disparities in subtype prevalence that contribute to explain regional differences in survival formerly described. Disease relapse and BC specific mortality differed by subtype and were lower for luminal A like tumours than for other subtypes for any stage at diagnosis. After a median follow-up of 10.9 years, 1311 (33%) had died, half of them 647 (16%) due to another disease, showing the importance of comorbidities. Omission of systemic therapies in selected patients was not associated with poorer BC specific survival, BC subtype and life expectancy playing a role.Information on tumour subtype is necessary for an adequate interpretation of population-based BC studies. Measures of comorbidity or frailty help in the evaluation of quality of care in the highly heterogeneous patients of the real world.",
  "<b>Objective:</b> To evaluate 5-years breast cancer-specific survival (CCS) by age, and the relationship of age at diagnosis and the risk of breast cancer mortality. <b>Methods:</b> Medical records of 3 470 resident patients diagnosed with primary, invasive female breast cancer between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2010 in four hospitals in Beijing were reviewed and collected. All patients were followed up until December 31, 2018 to acquire survival outcome. Five-years breast CCS of the five subgroups was estimated by the life-table method. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (<i>HR</i>s) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of different levels of age stratification and breast cancer mortality, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) model was used to detect the dose-response relationship. <b>Results:</b> The median diagnosis age among 3 470 female breast cancer patients was 53.2 years. There were 1 289 patients in the age-group of 45~54 years, with the highest proportion of 37.15%. However, only 126 patients occurred in the age-group of less than 35 years, with the lowest proportion of 3.63%. A total of 528 (15.22%) patients died of breast cancer during the study period. Overall 5-year CCS was 90.72% (95%<i>CI:</i> 89.74%~91.70%), 88.68% (95%<i>CI:</i> 83.09%~94.27%) and 87.05% (95%<i>CI:</i> 84.27%~89.82%) for all of the patients, aged less than 35 years and those aged 65 years and older. Compared with patients with diagnosis age of 45~54 years, the multivariate-adjusted <i>HR</i>s for breast cancer mortality associated with patients in age-group of <35 years and those in the age-group of \u226565 years were 1.72 (95% <i>CI:</i> 1.06~2.81) and 1.89 (95% <i>CI:</i> 1.43~2.49), respectively. In addition, patients aged \u226565 years had significantly higher risk of breast cancer mortality in Luminal subtypes, with <i>HR</i> of 1.70 (95% <i>CI:</i> 1.17~2.46) for Luminal A breast cancer and <i>HR</i> of 3.84 (95% <i>CI:</i> 1.74~8.49) for Luminal B breast cancer. RCS analysis exhibited a non-linear ( \"J-shaped\" ) relationship between diagnosis age of female breast cancer and the risk of breast cancer mortality (nonlinear <i>P</i><0.000 1). In addition, patients aged \u226565 years had significantly higher risk of breast cancer mortality in Luminal subtypes, with <i>HR</i> of 1.70 (95% <i>CI:</i> 1.17~2.46) for Luminal A breast cancer and <i>HR</i> of 3.84 (95% <i>CI:</i> 1.74~8.49) for Luminal B breast cancer. RCS analysis exhibited a non-linear ( \"J-shaped\" ) relationship between diagnosis age of female breast cancer and the risk of breast cancer mortality (nonlinear <i>P</i><0.000 1). <b>Conclusion:</b> Age at diagnosis is an important prognostic factor for female breast cancer, with worse outcome for both young and old patients.",
  "Trastuzumab is a drug used in HER2-positive breast cancer that increases patient survival. Due to cardiotoxicity is the most important side effect of trastuzumab treatment, cardiac monitoring should be a priority. The purpose of this study is to evaluate plasma NT-proBNP level and major cardiovascular risk factors as possible early predictors of trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity in HER2-positive breast cancer patients.We conducted a retrospective observational study involving 66 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with trastuzumab. Left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF), NT-proBNP values, and the history of cardiovascular risk factors were collected. Cardiotoxicity was diagnosed considering a decrease of the LVEF from baseline or clinical manifestation of congestive heart failure. NT-proBNP cut-off points were considered to establish normal or abnormal values according to patient age.27.3% of the patients suffered cardiotoxicity during trastuzumab treatment. Most cases were diagnosed due to the appearance of cardiac symptomatology (66.7%). Logistic regression analysis showed a significant association of diabetes mellitus (OR 5.9, 95% CI 1.2-28.5, p\u00a0=\u00a00.028) and high NT-proBNP levels (OR 22.0, 95% CI 5.7-85.4, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) with the development of trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity.NT-proBNP levels above the upper limit of the normal range adjusted to age or diabetes mellitus seem to be associated with a higher risk of developing cardiotoxicity. However, some limitations of the present study make necessary further studies aimed to clarify whether NT-proBNP and diabetes-associated markers determinations can be useful in the monitoring of cardiotoxicity risk in breast cancer patients undergoing trastuzumab therapy.",
  "Alcohol is an established risk factor for invasive breast cancer, and women with a prior ductal carcinoma in situ diagnosis are at higher risk of invasive breast cancer than the general population. However, for women with a prior ductal carcinoma in situ diagnosis, few studies have evaluated the association between alcohol and smoking and risk of subsequent invasive breast cancer.Utilizing a population-based case-control design nested among women diagnosed with a ductal carcinoma in situ between 1995 and 2013, we compared 243 cases diagnosed with a subsequent invasive breast cancer and 423 individually matched controls never diagnosed with a subsequent breast cancer.Compared with never to occasional drinkers, drinkers consuming at least 7 alcoholic drinks per week on average at ductal carcinoma in situ diagnosis had a higher risk of invasive breast cancer that was borderline significant (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.01-3.17, P value\u2009=\u20090.04). Smoking was not significantly associated with risk of developing an invasive breast cancer after adjustment for alcohol consumption.These findings suggest that consuming at least one alcoholic drink per day on average is positively associated with invasive breast cancer for women with a prior ductal carcinoma in situ diagnosis. If confirmed, modulating alcohol consumption could be one strategy for women with a history of ductal carcinoma in situ to impact their risk of invasive breast cancer.",
  "Although the incidence of breast cancer during pregnancy is increasing, little is known about short-term outcomes following breast cancer surgery during pregnancy. We aimed to compare the characteristics and outcomes of breast cancer surgery with and without pregnancy, and describe the obstetric outcomes following surgery.The data of 249,257 female patients aged\u2009<\u200960\u00a0years who underwent breast cancer surgery between July 2010 and March 2020 were analyzed using a nationwide Japanese database; we generated a 1:10 matched-pair cohort (260 and 2597 patients with and without pregnancy, respectively) matched according to age and treatment year. We conducted multivariable analyses to compare surgical procedures and outcomes, adjusting for potential confounders in the matched-pair cohort. Additionally, we described the obstetric outcomes of patients with pregnancy.Patients with pregnancy were more likely to undergo total mastectomy [odds ratio: 1.48 (95% confidence interval: 1.13-1.94)] and axillary dissection [1.62 (1.17-2.24)], but less likely to undergo reconstruction [0.14 (0.07-0.31)], than patients without; however, postoperative complications, postoperative length of stay, and total hospitalization costs did not differ significantly with pregnancy. Additionally, some pregnant patients experienced premature delivery [n\u2009=\u200918 (6.9%)] and miscarriage [n\u2009=\u20094 (1.5%)], and 31 of 101 patients in the third trimester at breast cancer surgery underwent a cesarean section.This study demonstrated significant differences regarding surgical procedures; however, there were no significant differences regarding surgical outcomes between patients who underwent breast cancer surgery with and without pregnancy. Obstetric outcomes following breast cancer surgery were also reported.",
  "Immune checkpoint blockade treatments bring remarkable clinical benefits to fighting several solid malignancies. However, the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in breast cancer remains controversial. Several clinical trials of immune checkpoint blockades focused on the effect of CTLA4 and PD1/PDL1 checkpoint inhibitors on breast cancer. Only a small portion of patients benefited from these therapies. Here we systematically investigated the expression of 50 immune checkpoint genes, including ADORA2A, LAG-3, TIM-3, PD1, PDL1, PDL2, CTLA-4, IDO1, B7-H3, B7-H4, CD244, BTLA, TIGIT, CD80, CD86, VISTA, CD28, ICOS, ICOSLG, HVEM, CD160, LIGHT, CD137, CD137L, OX40, CD70, CD27, CD40, CD40LG, LGALS9, GITRL, CEACAM1, CD47, SIRPA, DNAM1, CD155, 2B4, CD48, TMIGD2, HHLA2, BTN2A1, DC-SIGN, BTN2A2, BTN3A1, BTNL3, BTNL9, CD96, TDO, CD200 and CD200R, in different subtypes of breast cancer and assessed their prognostic value. The results showed that the expression patterns of these 50 immune checkpoint genes were distinct in breast cancer. High expression of B7-H3 mRNA was significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS), especially in patients with luminal A and luminal B breast cancer. The mRNA expression levels of TIM-3, ADORA2A, LAG3, CD86, CD80, PD1 and IDO1 had no relationship with OS in breast cancer. High expression levels of CTLA-4 and TIGIT were correlated with favorable prognosis in breast cancer. Interestingly, we observed that B7-H3 expression was negatively correlated with the efficacy of cyclophosphamide (CTX). In summary, our study suggested that B7-H3 has potential prognostic value in breast cancer and is a promising target for immune therapy.",
  "Phthalates are known endocrine-disrupting chemicals used indiscriminately as constituents in consumer products including food processing, and packaging, cosmetics, personal care and household items. Although, few studies have assessed the risk of breast cancer on exposure to phthalates, their association with breast cancer risk in Indian women have not yet been evaluated.We conducted a case-control study involving 171 participants. Urinary concentrations of six phthalate dieters; DMP (Dimethyl phthalate), DEP (Diethyl phthalate), DBP (Dibutyl phthalate), BBP (benzyl butyl phthalate), DEHP (Di-2-ethyl-hexyl phthalate), DINOP (Di-n-octyl phthalate) were estimated by GC-MS and geometric means were calculated. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess breast cancer risk on exposure to phthalates. Genes responsive to phthalates were identified through literature search and matched with NGS data, and gene-enrichment analysis was performed.Significant associations were observed between urinary phthalate concentrations and increased risk of breast cancer for di-butyl phthalate (OR=1.5, 95% CI; 1.06, 2.11, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and di-2-ethyl-hexyl phthalate (>median vs \u2264 median; OR=2.97, 95% CI; 1.18, 7.47, p\u00a0=\u00a00.005) in multivariable analyses. We also found several phthalate-responsive gene mutations in paired breast tumor tissues, which include PTPRD (76.19%), AR (42.86%), CYP1A1 (42.86%), CYP19A1 (23.81%), AHRR (19.05%), PIK3CA (19.05%), CYP1B1 (9.52%), RB1 (9.52%) and MMP9 (9.52%). Gene-enrichment analysis revealed that these genes form a major part of ER/PR, PPAR and HIF-1\u03b1-TGF-\u03b2 signaling cascades involved in breast cancer CONCLUSION: Although the sample size is small, in this first case-control study from India, DBP and DEHP were found to be associated with increased risk of invasive breast cancer and tumor tissues revealed mutations in several phthalate-responsive genes. It is, therefore suggested that human biomonitoring in India and larger studies evaluating the early life genetic and epigenetic alterations on phthalates exposure are required to establish their role in breast carcinogenesis.",
  "Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4/6 inhibitor is a first-line therapy for metastatic ER+/HER2-breast cancer. However, there are limited data on safety of combined radiotherapy (RT) and CDK4/6 inhibition.We conducted a retrospective study of women with metastatic breast cancer who received palliative RT within 14 days of CDK4/6 inhibitor use. The primary endpoint was toxicity per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5. Secondary endpoints were pain response and local control based on clinical assessment and imaging.Thirty patients underwent 36 RT courses with palbociclib (n\u00a0=\u00a034 courses, 94.4%) or abemaciclib (n\u00a0=\u00a02, 5.6%). RT was delivered before, concurrently or after CDK4/6 inhibitors in 7 (19.4%), 8 (22.2%), and 21 (58.3%) of cases with median 3.5 days from RT to closest CDK4/6 inhibitor administration. Median RT dose was 30Gy (range 8-40.05Gy). Treated sites included brain (n\u00a0=\u00a05, 11.6%), spine (n\u00a0=\u00a019, 44.2%), pelvis (n\u00a0=\u00a09, 20.9%), other bony sites (n\u00a0=\u00a06, 14.0%) and others (n\u00a0=\u00a04, 9.3%). No acute grade \u22653 non-hematologic toxicity occurred. No increased hematologic toxicity was attributable to RT with grade 3 hematologic toxicities rates 16.7%, 0%, and 6.7% before, during, and 2 weeks after RT completion. All but one patient (29/30) achieved symptom relief. Local control rates were 94.4%, 91.7% at 6 and 12 months.The use of RT within 2 weeks of CDK4/6 inhibitors had low acceptable toxicity and high efficacy, suggesting that it is safe for palliation of metastatic breast cancer.",
  "To evaluate the significance of postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) in female breast cancer patients with T1-2N1M0 disease according to molecular subtypes and other risk factors.We conducted a retrospective cohort-based study utilizing the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Patients who were diagnosed with T1-2N1M0 invasive breast cancer and received mastectomy between 2010 and 2014 were enrolled in our study. Overall survival (OS) was calculated with Kaplan-Meier method, and multivariant Cox hazard model was conducted to identify the impact of PMRT according to molecular subtypes and other risk factors. Propensity score matching (PSM) was applied to balance measurable confounders.Of all the 16,521 enrolled patients, 5775 (35.0%) cases received PMRT. The distribution of molecular subtype is 71.4% for Luminal A, 13.2% for Luminal B, 5.1% for HER2 enriched, and 10.3% for TNBC. The OS was significantly better for patients in PMRT group than the Non-PMRT group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Stratified by molecular subtype, PMRT significantly prolonged survival in Luminal A patients (HR: 0.759, 95% CI: 0.651-0.884, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), Yet it brought no significant survival advantage in Luminal B, TNBC or HER2 enriched subtype (P\u00a0=\u00a00.914, P\u00a0=\u00a00.124, P\u00a0=\u00a00.103, respectively). Also, PMRT bore prognostic significance among those patients who were older than 56 years old, single, white, exempt from reconstruction and chemotherapy, and were with ductal, Grade\u2161tumor (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). After PSM, the survival benefit of PRMT sustained in Luminal A patients with T1 tumor concomitant with one positive lymph node.Our study demonstrates a beneficial impact for PMRT on overall survival among Luminal A subtype breast cancer patients with T1-2N1 disease. The selection of PMRT should be stratified by molecular subtype and other risk factors.",
  "Use of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is associated with increased risk for breast cancer. However, the relevant mechanisms and its interaction with genetic variants are not fully understood. We conducted a genome-wide interaction analysis between MHT use and genetic variants for breast cancer risk in 27,585 cases and 34,785 controls from 26 observational studies. All women were post-menopausal and of European ancestry. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to test for multiplicative interactions between genetic variants and current MHT use. We considered interaction p-values\u2009<\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-8</sup> as genome-wide significant, and p-values\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-5</sup> as suggestive. Linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based clumping was performed to identify independent candidate variants. None of the 9.7 million genetic variants tested for interactions with MHT use reached genome-wide significance. Only 213 variants, representing 18 independent loci, had p-values\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>5</sup>. The strongest evidence was found for rs4674019 (p-value\u2009=\u20092.27\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-7</sup>), which showed genome-wide significant interaction (p-value\u2009=\u20093.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-8</sup>) with current MHT use when analysis was restricted to population-based studies only. Limiting the analyses to combined estrogen-progesterone MHT use only or to estrogen receptor (ER) positive cases did not identify any genome-wide significant evidence of interactions. In this large genome-wide SNP-MHT interaction study of breast cancer, we found no strong support for common genetic variants modifying the effect of MHT on breast cancer risk. These results suggest that common genetic variation has limited impact on the observed MHT-breast cancer risk association.",
  "Alcohol intake is a known risk factor for breast cancer. National organizations recommend that women consume no more than one serving of alcohol per day, if at all; however, many women exceed this recommendation, and some are unwilling to decrease consumption. Our study sought to identify factors associated with women's unwillingness to decrease their alcohol intake to decrease their breast cancer risk.942 women in a screening mammography cohort were asked questions about their demographics, personal and family health history, lifestyle factors, and willingness/unwillingness to decrease alcohol intake to decrease their breast cancer risk. Univariate and multivariate analyzes of their responses were performed.13.2% of women in our cohort indicated they were unwilling to decrease their alcohol intake to reduce their breast cancer risk. After adjusting for potential confounders, women who were 60\u2009years and older were more than twice as unwilling to decrease their alcohol intake compared to their younger counterparts (<i>P</i>\u2009=\u2009.0002). Women who had an annual household income of more than $200,000 were 1.75 times more unwilling to decrease their alcohol intake compared to their less affluent counterparts (<i>P</i>\u2009=\u2009.033). Unwillingness was not significantly associated with race/ethnicity, education, having a first-degree family member with cancer, health perception, breast cancer risk perception, or BMI.Levels of unwillingness to decrease alcohol intake differed by age and household income. An opportunity is present to potentially decrease breast cancer risk in the community by educating women, especially older and more affluent women, about alcohol as a risk factor for breast cancer and the importance of limiting one's alcohol intake.",
  "To assess the impact of fertility preservation (FP) requiring ovarian stimulation on breast cancer outcomes and pregnancy after breast cancer.Women aged\u2009\u2264\u200940\u00a0years diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer between 2007 and 2018 and referred for FP consultation prior to systemic therapy were identified from a British Columbia fertility center database. The primary endpoint was invasive breast cancer-free survival (iBCFS) and secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and achievement of pregnancy. Survival and pregnancy endpoints were compared using Cox and logistic regression analyses, respectively, for patients who did and did not undergo FP.The study included 153 patients, with 71 (46%) in the FP group and 82 (54%) in the non-FP group. Patients who underwent FP were more likely to be ECOG 0 (99% vs. 88%, p\u2009=\u20090.011) and receive chemotherapy (93% vs. 67%, p\u2009<\u20090.001), but had similar ER positivity status to non-FP patients (70% vs. 79%, p\u2009=\u20090.21). Over a median follow-up of 4.1\u00a0years, there were no differences in iBCFS (HR 1.006, 95% CI 0.416-2.438, p\u2009=\u20090.988) or OS (HR 0.789, 95% CI 0.210-2.956, p\u2009=\u20090.725) between FP and non-FP groups. Patients who underwent FP had higher odds of conceiving at least once (OR 3.024, 95% CI 1.312-6.970, p\u2009=\u20090.008).At a median follow-up of 4.1\u00a0years, FP did not impact iBCFS or OS, supporting its safety in young women with breast cancer. In addition, patients who underwent FP were more likely to become pregnant after breast cancer, highlighting the value of pre-oncologic treatment FP in survivorship family planning.",
  "To compare the outcome of allogeneic stem cell transplantation for myeloid malignancies in breast cancer survivors to a contemporaneous control group.Medical records of all patients with a history of breast cancer who received allogeneic stem cell transplants at a single, tertiary referral Comprehensive Cancer Center\u00a0between 2002 and 2019 were reviewed. Transplant outcomes were compared to 289 control patients without a history of breast cancer from the same time period. Main outcomes included survival, disease-free survival, non-relapse mortality, relapse or progression of hematologic malignancy, and incidence of recurrent breast cancer after hematopoietic cell transplantation. Comparisons between women with a history of breast cancer and controls utilized propensity score weighting to balance patient characteristics.Forty women, ages 30-74\u00a0years, with a history of breast cancer received an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant for a hematologic malignancy between December 2002 and February 2019. Twelve of the 40 patients are alive with a median survival of 7.4\u00a0years (range, 1.9-16.8\u00a0years). None of the patients had evidence of recurrent breast cancer prior to death or date of last contact. In multivariable Cox models, all transplant outcomes were similar between the patients and the control group with hematopoietic cell transplant comorbidity score as the most important confounding factor for adjustment in these models.A history of treated breast cancer should not exclude patients from consideration for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation.",
  "The standardization of the AJCC TNM staging system for breast cancer allows physicians to evaluate patients with breast cancer using standard language and criteria, assess treatment response, and compare patient outcomes. Previous editions of the <i>AJCC Cancer Staging Manual</i> relied on the anatomic TNM method of staging that incorporates imaging and uses population-level survival data to predict patient outcomes. Recent advances in therapy based on biomarker status and multigene panels have improved treatment strategies. In the newest edition of the <i>AJCC Cancer Staging Manual</i> (8th edition, adopted on January 1, 2018), breast cancer staging integrates anatomic staging with tumor grade, biomarker data regarding hormone receptor status, oncogene expression, and gene expression profiling to assign a prognostic stage. This article reviews the 8th edition of the AJCC breast cancer staging system with a focus on anatomic staging and the challenges that anatomic staging poses for radiologists. We highlight key imaging findings that impact patient treatment and discuss the role of imaging in evaluating response to neoadjuvant therapy. Finally, we discuss biomarkers and multigene panels and how these impact prognostic stage. The review will help radiologists identify critical findings that affect breast cancer staging and understand ongoing limitations of imaging in staging.",
  "Patients with breast cancer encounter difficulties in making surgical treatment decisions. Shared decision-making (SDM) with patient decision aids (PDAs) can minimize patients' decisional conflicts. However, the effect of PDAs in Asia remains inconclusive. This study investigated the effect of SDM assisted by PDAs on the decisional conflict of patients with breast cancer.In this two-group, outcome assessor-blind, randomized controlled trial, 151 patients diagnosed as having breast cancer were assigned to the PDA (SDM with PDA) group or the standard (SDM without PDA) group. Demographic and clinical variables were analyzed to identify variables affecting the treatment choice. The patients' decision-making difficulties were evaluated using the four-item SURE scale during preoperative hospitalization, and decisional conflicts were examined using the five-item Decision Regret scale and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) 1\u00a0month after surgery.The choice of breast conservation therapy and mastectomy did not significantly differ between the PDA and standard groups. The PDA group had a higher level of depression after making decisions (P\u2009=\u20090.029) than did the standard group. No significant difference in the total scores of the SURE scale and Decision Regret scale were noted between the groups.PDAs did not assist the patients with breast cancer in making breast surgery-related decisions. Clinicians should focus on SDM grounded in evidence-based medicine with care and help patients consider their individual preferences.ClinicalTrial.gov, NCT03105076; April 7, 2017 ( http://www.gov ).",
  "The benefits of postoperative chemotherapy in patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer remain unclear. The use of tumor grade, Ki-67, or ER expression failed to provide an accurate prognosis of the risk of relapse after surgery in patients. This study aimed to evaluate whether a multigene assay Curebest\u2122 95GC Breast (95GC) can identify the risk of recurrence and provide more insights into the requirements for chemotherapy in patients.This single-arm retrospective multicenter joint study included patients with ER-positive, node-negative breast cancer who were treated at five facilities in Japan and had received endocrine therapy alone as adjuvant therapy. The primary lesion specimens obtained during surgery were analyzed using the 95GC breast cancer multigene assay. Based on the 95GC results, patients were classified into low-risk (95GC-L) and high-risk (95GC-H) groups.The 10-year relapse-free survival rates were 88.4 and 59.6% for the 95GC-L and 95GC-H groups, respectively. Histologic grade, Ki-67, and PAM50 exhibited a significant relationship with the 95GC results. The segregation into 95GC-L and 95GC-H groups within established clinical factors can identify subgroups of patients using histologic grade or PAM50 classification with good prognosis without receiving chemotherapy.Based on the results of our retrospective study, 95GC could be used to evaluate the long-term prognosis of ER-positive, node-negative breast cancer. Even though further prospective validation is necessary, the inclusion of 95GC in clinical practice could help to select optimal treatments for breast cancer patients and identify those who do not benefit from the addition of chemotherapy, thus avoiding unnecessary treatment.",
  "Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II plays critical roles in antigen presentation and the initiation of immune responses. However, the correlation between the HLA class II gene expression level and the survival of patients with breast cancer is still under investigation. We analyzed microarray and RNA-Seq data of breast cancer from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA), genotype-tissue expression (GTEx) and Oncomine databases by using bioinformatics tools. The expression of the HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2, and HLA-DQB2 genes was significantly upregulated in breast cancer. Higher expression levels of HLA class II genes in breast cancer, especially HLA-DOB and HLA-DQB2, were significantly associated with better overall survival. Furthermore, the expression of HLA class II genes was more closely associated with survival in breast cancer than in other cancer types. CD48 coexpressed with both HLA-DOB and HLA-DQB2 was also positively associated with the overall survival of breast cancer patients. The results indicated that HLA class II and CD48 may enhance antitumor immunity, and their expression patterns may serve as potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in breast cancer.",
  "Approximately 7% of breast cancers are diagnosed in women under 40. Question of subsequent fertility has become fundamental. We aimed to evaluate the rate of fertility preservation (FP) by oocyte retrieval (OR) after ovarian stimulation in patients of childbearing age, managed for breast cancer with adjuvant chemotherapy in France, reuse rate of frozen gametes and live births rate (LBR) after treatment.We included 15,774 women between 18 and 40 years old, managed by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer, between January 2011 and December 2020 from a French health registry. Patients with OR after breast surgery and before chemotherapy were considered as FP group; those with no OR as no FP group. To compare LBR with French population independently of age, we calculated Standardized Incidence Rates (SIR) of live births using indirect standardization method.FP rate increased gradually since 2011, reaching 17% in 2019. A decrease in use was observed in 2020 (13,9%). Among patients with at least 2 years of follow-up, gamete reuse rate was 5,6%. Births after cancer were mostly from spontaneous pregnancies. Among patients with at least 3 years of follow-up, LBR was 19,6% in FP group, 3,9% in second group. SIR of live births was of 1,05 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.91-1.19) and 0.33 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.30-0.36) in FP and no FP group respectively.Oncofertility activity increased until 2019 in France, reaching 17%. Gamete reuse rate was low. Births resulted mainly from spontaneous pregnancies. SIR of live births was lower in no FP group.",
  "Clinical database is a collection of clinical data related to patients, which can be used for analysis and research. Clinical data can be classified into several categories: patient-related, tumor-related, diagnostics-related, treatment-related, outcome-related, administration-related, and other clinical data. Clinical databases can be classified according to the data types of clinical databases, ranges of institutes, and accessibility to data. The numbers of papers and clinical trials are rapidly increasing. Recently, more than 9000 papers related to breast cancer have been published annually, and more than 7000 papers related to human breast cancer are published annually. The speed of increase is expected to be faster and faster in future. Now, almost 8000 clinical trials are registered world widely. Main research areas of breast cancer can be classified into followings; epidemiology, screening and prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Clinical databases that are available for breast cancer research are also introduced in this chapter. The analysis of big data is expected to be the mainstream of breast cancer research using clinical databases. As the technology of artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly evolving, the technology of deep learning starts to be applied for breast cancer research. In near future, AI technology is predicted to penetrate deeply the field of breast cancer research.",
  "As a transcription factor and proto-oncogene, MYC is known to be deregulated in a variety of tumors, including breast cancer. However, no consistent conclusion on the role and mechanism of MYC deregulation during breast cancer carcinogenesis has been formed. Here, we used the UALCAN, bc-GenExMiner, TCGA, cBioportal, STRING and Kaplan-Meier Plotter databases to explore the mRNA expression, prognosis, transcriptional profile changes, signal pathway rewiring and interaction with the cancer stem cells of MYC in breast cancer. We found that the expression of MYC varies in different subtypes of breast cancer, with relatively high frequency in TNBC. As a transcription factor, MYC not only participates in the rewiring of cancer signaling pathways, such as estrogen, WNT, NOTCH and other pathways, but also interacts with cancer stem cells. MYC is significantly positively correlated with breast cancer stem cell markers such as CD44, CD24, and ALDH1. Collectively, our results highlight that MYC plays an important regulatory role in the occurrence of breast cancer, and its amplification can be used as a predictor of diagnosis and prognosis. The interaction between MYC and cancer stem cells may play a crucial role in regulating the initiation and metastasis of breast cancer.",
  "Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are considered as the major cause to tumor initiation, recurrence, metastasis, and drug resistance, driving poor clinical outcomes in patients. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as crucial regulators in cancer development and progression. However, limited lncRNAs involved in CSCs have been reported.The novel lncROPM (a regulator of phospholipid metabolism) in breast CSCs (BCSCs) was identified by microarray and validated by qRT-PCR in BCSCs from breast cancer cells and tissues. The clinical significance of lncROPM was evaluated in two breast cancer cohorts and TANRIC database (TCGA-BRCA, RNAseq data). Gain- and loss-of-function assays were performed to examine the role of lncROPM on BCSCs both in vitro and in vivo. The regulatory mechanism of lncROPM was investigated by bioinformatics, RNA FISH, RNA pull-down, luciferase reporter assay, and actinomycin D treatment. PLA2G16-mediated phospholipid metabolism was determined by UHPLC-QTOFMS system. Cells' chemosensitivity was assessed by CCK8 assay.LncROPM is highly expressed in BCSCs. The enhanced lncROPM exists in clinic breast tumors and other solid tumors and positively correlates with malignant grade/stage and poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Gain- and loss-of-function studies show that lncROPM is required for the maintenance of BCSCs properties both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, lncROPM regulates PLA2G16 expression by directly binding to 3'-UTR of PLA2G16 to increase the mRNA stability. The increased PLA2G16 significantly promotes phospholipid metabolism and the production of free fatty acid, especially arachidonic acid in BCSCs, thereby activating PI3K/AKT, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, and Hippo/YAP signaling, thus eventually involving in the maintenance of BCSCs stemness. Importantly, lncROPM and PLA2G16 notably contribute to BCSCs chemo-resistance. Administration of BCSCs using clinic therapeutic drugs such as doxorubicin, cisplatin, or tamoxifen combined with Giripladib (an inhibitor of cytoplasmic phospholipase A2) can efficiently eliminate BCSCs and tumorigenesis.Our study highlights that lncROPM and its target PLA2G16 play crucial roles in sustaining BCSC properties and may serve as a biomarker for BCSCs or other cancer stem cells. Targeting lncROPM-PLA2G16 signaling axis may be a novel therapeutic strategy for patients with breast cancer.",
  "Early screening is an important means to reduce breast cancer mortality. In order to solve the problem of low breast cancer screening rates caused by limited medical resources in remote and impoverished areas, this paper designs a breast cancer screening system aided with portable ultrasound Clarius. The system automatically segments the tumor area of the B-ultrasound image on the mobile terminal and uses the ultrasound radio frequency data on the cloud server to automatically classify the benign and malignant tumors. Experimental results in this study show that the accuracy of breast tumor segmentation reaches 98%, and the accuracy of benign and malignant classification reaches 82%, and the system is accurate and reliable. The system is easy to set up and operate, which is convenient for patients in remote and poor areas to carry out early breast cancer screening. It is beneficial to objectively diagnose disease, and it is the first time for the domestic breast cancer auxiliary screening system on the mobile terminal.",
  "The purpose of this study was to identify oncologist-reported barriers and motivators in addressing long-term effects with breast cancer survivors.This study is a secondary analysis of data from a survey of U.S. medical oncologists (n\u2009=\u2009217) about breast cancer survivorship care in clinical practice. Using both closed- and open-ended questions, we asked oncologists to report barriers and motivators they perceived in addressing long-term effects with breast cancer patients. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize and rank items endorsed by oncologists in analyses of quantitative data; content analysis was used to identify salient categories of barriers and motivators in qualitative data.Key barriers to managing physical long-term effects included lack of time during appointments (n\u2009=\u2009128 oncologists, 59%) and perceived lack of evidence-based interventions (n\u2009=\u200989, 41%). With respect to psychosocial effects, oncologists reported lack of knowledge (n\u2009=\u200988, 40.6%) and challenges making referrals to mental health providers (n\u2009=\u2009115, 53%). From the qualitative data, three distinct barrier categories emerged: \"Competing priorities during brief appointments;\" \"Discussing long-term effects-Who? What? When?;\" and \"Beyond my expertise and comfort level.\" Two motivator categories emerged: \"I owe it to them;\" and \"Giving people a life worth living.\"Oncologists' key motivators for addressing long-term effects were focused on professional values, relationships with survivors, and their commitment to prioritizing patients' quality of life. Future efforts should leverage oncologists' professional and interpersonal motivators to enhance the delivery of survivorship care for breast cancer.",
  "To evaluate the significance and benefit of radiotherapy (RT) in young early-stage breast cancer patients according to different molecular subtypes.We conducted a retrospective cohort study utilizing the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database with known hormone receptor (HoR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status. Female patients aged 18-45, received RT treatment, and diagnosed with stage T1-3, N0-3, M0 primary breast cancer between 2010 and 2013 were identified.Of all the 23\u00a0148 included patients, 14\u00a0708 (63.54%), 3385 (14.62%), 1225 (5.29%), and 3830 (16.55%) were diagnosed with luminal-A (HoR\u00a0+\u00a0HER2-), luminal-B (HoR\u00a0+\u00a0HER2+), HER2-enriched (HoR-HER2+), and triple-negative (HoR-HER2-) breast cancer, respectively. RT was significantly correlated with improved overall survival (OS, HR: 0.295; 95% CI:0.138-0.63, P\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS, HR: 0.328; 95% CI: 0.153-0.702, P\u00a0=\u00a00.004) in HER2-enriched patients. In addition, a significantly prolonged OS was also observed when RT was given to luminal-A (HR: 0.696; 95% CI: 0.538-0.902, P\u00a0=\u00a00.006) and luminal-B (HR: 0.385; 95% CI:0.199-0.744, P\u00a0=\u00a00.005) breast cancer patients compared to those without RT. Multivariable-adjusted analyses showed that HER2 was a significant favorable factor for RT benefit in breast cancer patients.RT could offer significant survival benefit in luminal-A, luminal-B, and especially HER2-enriched young early-stage breast cancer female patients. The results enabled clinicians to predict the benefits of RT and improve evidence-based treatment for breast cancer patients.",
  "To further quantify the association between physical activity (PA) after breast cancer diagnosis and all-cause mortality, breast cancer mortality and/or breast cancer recurrence.PubMed was searched until November 2017 for observational studies investigating any type of PA in association with total mortality, breast cancer mortality and/or breast cancer recurrence among women with breast cancer diagnosis. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using random-effects models for highest versus lowest categories of PA. Ten studies were included in the meta-analysis. During an average follow-up ranging from 3.5 to 12.7 years there were 23,041 breast cancer survivors, 2,522 deaths from all causes, 841 deaths from breast cancer and 1,398 recurrences/remissions. Compared to women in the lowest recreational PA level (lowest quintile/quartile), women in the highest level had a lower risk of all-cause mortality (HR\u202f=\u202f0.58, 95% CIs: 0.45-0.75; 8 studies), of death from breast cancer (HR\u202f=\u202f0.60, 95% CIs 0.36-0.99; 5 studies) and a lower, albeit non-significant, risk of recurrence (HR\u202f=\u202f0.79, 95% CIs 0.60-1.05; 5 studies). There was evidence of heterogeneity between the studies evaluating recreational PA and total mortality (\u0399<sup>2</sup>\u202f=\u202f52.4%) and even higher for breast cancer mortality (\u0399<sup>2</sup>\u202f=\u202f77.7%) or recurrence (\u0399<sup>2</sup>\u202f=\u202f66.4%).Highest recreational PA after breast cancer diagnosis was associated with lower all-cause and breast cancer mortality. This finding probably reflects the favorable impact of PA on cardiovascular mortality, and a possible favorable role on breast cancer survival, though reverse causation cannot be excluded.",
  "Collagen type X alpha 1 (COL10A1) is overexpressed in diverse tumors and displays vital roles in tumorigenesis. However, the prognostic value of COL10A1 in breast cancer remains unclear.The expression of COL10A1 was analyzed by the Oncomine database and UALCAN cancer database. The relationship between COL10A1 expression level and clinical indicators including prognostic data in breast cancer were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier Plotter, PrognoScan, and Breast Cancer Gene-Expression Miner (bc-GenExMiner) databases.COL10A1 was up-regulated in different subtypes of breast cancer. Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) status and nodal status were positively correlated with COL10A1 expression. Conversely, age, the Scarff-Bloom-Richardson (SBR) grade, basal-like status, and triple-negative status were negatively related to COL10A1 level in breast cancer samples compared with normal tissues. Patients with increased COL10A1 expression level showed worse overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and disease-free survival (DFS). COL10A1 was positively correlated with metastatic relapse-free survival. GSEA analysis revealed that enrichment of TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway. 15-leucine-rich repeat containing membrane protein (LRRC15) is a correlated gene of COL10A1.Bioinformatics analysis revealed that COL10A1 might be considered as a predictive biomarker for prognosis of breast cancer. Further experiments and clinical trials are essential to elucidate the value of COL10A1 in breast cancer treatment.",
  "Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease for which there is limited understanding of treatment patterns and prognostic factors.Men with TNM stage I to stage III breast cancer diagnosed between 2004 and 2014 in the National Cancer Data Base were included. Trends in treatment modalities were described using the average annual percentage change (AAPC) and estimated using Joinpoint software for the analysis of trends. Kaplan-Meier curves and the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model were used to compare survival between subgroups and to identify prognostic factors.A total of 10,873 MBC cases were included, with a median age at diagnosis of 64\u00a0years. Breast-conserving surgery was performed in 24% of patients, and 70% of patients undergoing breast conservation received radiotherapy. Approximately 44% of patients received chemotherapy, and 62% of patients with estrogen receptor-positive disease received endocrine therapy. Oncotype DX was ordered in 35% of patients with lymph node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative tumors. During the study period, there was a significant increase in the rates of total mastectomy, contralateral prophylactic mastectomy, radiotherapy after breast conservation, ordering of Oncotype DX, and the use of endocrine therapy (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). On multivariate analysis, factors found to be associated with worse overall survival were older age, black race, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index, high tumor grade and stage of disease, and undergoing total mastectomy. Residing in a higher income area; having progesterone receptor-positive tumors; and receipt of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and endocrine therapy were associated with better overall survival.Despite the lack of prospective randomized trials in patients with MBC, the results of the current study demonstrated that the treatment of this disease has evolved over the years. These findings further the understanding of the modern treatment and prognosis of MBC, and identify several areas for further research.",
  "To investigate overall and breast cancer-specific mortality in early-stage breast cancer patients with and without schizophrenia or related disorders.We used Danish national registers to identify all women with no prior history of cancer or organic mental disorders, who were diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer 1995-2011. Logistic regression models were used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) for not being allocated to guideline treatment. Cox regression models were used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) for overall and breast cancer-specific deaths among women allocated or not allocated to guideline treatment.We identified 56,152 women with early-stage breast cancer diagnosed in 1995-2011, of whom 499 women also had been diagnosed with schizophrenia or related disorders. The likelihood of women with schizophrenia or related disorders for not being allocated to guideline treatment was increased (adjusted OR, 1.50; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.15-1.94). The adjusted HR for all-cause mortality was 1.55; 95% CI, 1.32-1.82 and 1.12 (95% CI, 0.98-1.50) for breast cancer-specific mortality; women allocated to guideline treatment had an adjusted HR for breast cancer-specific death of 1.42 (95% CI, 1.11-1.82). The adjusted HR for death due to unnatural causes was 3.67 (95% CI, 1.80-7.35).The survival of women with schizophrenia or related disorders after breast cancer is significantly worse than that of women without these disorders. These patients are less likely to be allocated to guideline treatment, and, among those who are, mortality from both breast cancer and other causes is increased.",
  "In all living things, temperature is a key factor to maintain function and survive. Animals and plants need to adapt temperature change with optimizing their behaviour and growth by sensing temperature. Similarly, tumour cells must adapt continuously to fluctuations in external conditions including temperature. To find a better environment, cancer cells promote growth and metastasis, which contributes to tumour malignancy. Pathological studies in breast cancer have implied that temperature is associated with disease progression. However, no clear mechanisms have emerged for how thermal changes affect tumour cells and their gene regulation in tumour development and malignancy. Here we discovered the temperature-dependent extracellular vesicle (EV) secretion in breast cancer. Cancer cell growth and EV secretion increased in a temperature-dependent manner, which indicated that temperatures were associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. We also found that <i>low-density lipoprotein receptor</i> (<i>LDLR</i>), a responsible gene for temperature-dependent EV secretion, was upregulated with the increase in temperature. Consistent with our results, <i>LDLR</i> gene has been characterized and identified as a key factor for malignancy in a wide range of cancers. Our findings shed new light on tumour aggressiveness and therapeutic strategies for breast cancer, especially regarding EV formation and secretion, thus providing a new relationship between cancer and EV biology in the light of temperature.",
  "There is convincing evidence demonstrating that body size characteristics such as adiposity and height are associated with breast cancer in westernized countries. However, little is known about this relationship in North African countries currently undergoing nutritional transition and industrialization. The aim of this study was to explore associations between various body size characteristics, silhouette trajectories and the risk of breast cancer among Moroccan women.In this case-control study conducted in the Fez region (2016-2017), detailed measures of body size were collected for 300 cases of breast cancer and 300 matched controls. Unconditional logistic regression was used to assess the association between body size and breast cancer risk adjusting for confounding factors.Higher waist circumference and hip circumference were positively associated with breast cancer risk in pre- (highest [T3] vs. lowest tertile [T1]: OR\u2009=\u20092.92, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.33-6.42; OR\u2009=\u20093.00, 95% CI: 1.42-6.33, respectively) and post-menopausal women (T3 vs. T1: OR\u2009=\u20094.46, 95% CI: 1.86-10.66; OR\u2009=\u20094.08, 95% CI: 1.76-9.42, respectively). Body shape at younger ages (6-11\u00a0years) was inversely associated with the risk of breast cancer in premenopausal women (large vs. lean silhouette: OR\u2009=\u20090.31, 95% CI: 0.12-0.80). Women with the greatest increase in body shape trajectory had higher risk for both pre- and post-menopausal breast cancer (T3 vs. T1: OR\u2009=\u20092.74, 95% CI: 1.03-7.26; OR\u2009=\u20093.56, 95% CI: 1.34-9.44, respectively).Our findings suggest that adiposity, body shape at younger ages, and silhouette trajectory may play a role in the development of pre- and post-menopausal breast cancer among Moroccan women. Larger-scale prospective studies are needed to confirm our findings and to explore these associations with breast cancer subtypes.",
  "This review is focused on trials generating results that potentially impacted clinical practice since the 2017 St. Gallen Consensus; the most impactful trial was KATHERINE, which revealed a 11.3% absolute iDFS improvement with T-DM1 (compared to trastuzumab) in HER2-positive breast cancer patients who presented invasive residual disease following neoadjuvant treatment. These results, if reinforced by a subsequent overall survival benefit, will consolidate neoadjuvant treatment as the standard-of-care for most HER2-positive breast cancer patients. The addition of pertuzumab to adjuvant trastuzumab (APHINITY) or extending anti-HER2 therapy with 1 year of neratinib (ExteNET) also improved outcomes, but in a more modest way. In triple-negative early breast cancer patients presenting invasive residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the CREATE-X trial demonstrated the benefit of post-neoadjuvant capecitabine. In patients with luminal tumours, updated results of the SOFT/TEXT trials confirmed the benefit of aromatase inhibitors plus ovarian suppression in high-risk premenopausal patients, and the 12-year results of the BIG1-98 trial demonstrated a sustained trend in favour of letrozole compared to tamoxifen in the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal patients. The TAILOR-X study showed that, overall, patients with an intermediate recurrence risk score (11-25) in the OncotypeDX 21-gene assay did not benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. A meta-analysis performed by the EBCTCG demonstrated that extended adjuvant aromatase inhibitors modestly reduced breast cancer recurrence risks, with a more pronounced benefit in patients previously treated with tamoxifen. Finally, an EBCTCG meta-analysis including patients with all breast cancer subtypes showed that dose-dense chemotherapy improved survival when compared to conventionally-timed chemotherapy.",
  "Genetic change, particularly epigenetic alteration, is one of the imperative factors for sporadic breast cancer development in the worldwide population of women. The DNA methylation process is essential and natural for human cellular renewal and tissue homeostasis, but its dysregulation contributes to many pathological changes, including breast tumorigenesis. Chemopreventive agents mainly protect the abnormal DNA methylation either by hindering the division of pre-malignant cells or looming the DNA damage, which leads to malignancy. The present review article is about understanding the potential role of dietary phytochemicals in breast cancer prevention. Accordingly, a literature search of the published article until August 2021 has been performed. Further, we have investigated the binding affinity of different phytochemicals isolated from diverse dietary sources against the various oncogenic proteins related to breast cancer initiation to understand the common target(s) in breast cancer prevention mechanisms. Various small phytochemicals, especially dietary phytochemicals including sulforaphane, mahanine, resveratrol, linolenic acid, diallyl sulfide, benzyl/phenethyl isothiocyanate, etc. are being investigated as the chemopreventive agent to manage breast cancer development, and some of them have shown promising outcomes in the cited research. In this present review, we discuss the recent advancement in acceptance of such types of potential dietary phytochemicals as a chemopreventive agent against breast cancer development and their inner lining mechanism. The critical clinical trials and cohort studies have also been considered to understand the progress in contemporary perspectives.",
  "In human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer, emerging evidence imply that clinical behaviors differ according to hormone receptor (HR) status. However, there is no conclusion about the relevance between estrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR) expression and clinical outcome of HER2+ breast cancer. Our study aimed to determine the influence of different ER/PR levels on survival outcome of HER2+ early breast cancer.Nine hundred and nineteen early HER2+ breast cancer patients treated between 2009 and 2016 were retrospectively reviewed and HR+/HER2+ patients were further divided based on ER level (Low/L: 1%-9%; Median/M: 10%-79%; High/H: 80%-100%) and PR level (Low/L: 0%-19%; High/H: 20%-100%) according to restricted cubic spline (RCS) smoothing curve. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and log rank test.Four hundred and forty two HR+/HER2+ and 477 HR-/HER2+ breast cancer patients were included in our study and 73.2% received target therapy (HR+ 69.7%, HR- 76.5%). While HR+/HER2+ breast cancer showed better survival than HR-/HER2+ subtype in 5-year disease free survival (DFS, 93.0% vs. 86.8%, P < .001), no significant difference was observed between DFS in ER+/PR+ and ER+/PR- subgroup (94.4% vs. 90.4%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.22). However, a potential correlation was found between ER/PR levels and DFS in HR+/HER2+ (P\u00a0=\u00a0.074) tumors. In HR+/HER2+ breast cancer, all subgroups showed DFS improvement trend versus M-ER/L-PR. In all HER2+ patients, hazard ratio of H-ER/H-PR compared with HR- subtype was 0.10 (95%CI 0.01-0.74, P\u00a0=\u00a0.024) in all patients and 0.14 (95%CI, 0.02-1.02, P\u00a0=\u00a0.053) in patients receiving anti-HER2 therapy.ER/PR expression may become a predictor of survival benefit in HER2+ early breast cancer and a higher ER/PR level might be associated with better DFS.",
  "Cancer is a manifestation of disorders caused by the changes in the body's cells that go far beyond healthy development as well as stabilization. Breast cancer is a common disease. According to the stats given by the World Health Organization (WHO), 7.8 million women are diagnosed with breast cancer. Breast cancer is the name of the malignant tumor which is normally developed by the cells in the breast. Machine learning (ML) approaches, on the other hand, provide a variety of probabilistic and statistical ways for intelligent systems to learn from prior experiences to recognize patterns in a dataset that can be used, in the future, for decision making. This endeavor aims to build a deep learning-based model for the prediction of breast cancer with a better accuracy. A novel deep extreme gradient descent optimization (DEGDO) has been developed for the breast cancer detection. The proposed model consists of two stages of training and validation. The training phase, in turn, consists of three major layers data acquisition layer, preprocessing layer, and application layer. The data acquisition layer takes the data and passes it to preprocessing layer. In the preprocessing layer, noise and missing values are converted to the normalized which is then fed to the application layer. In application layer, the model is trained with a deep extreme gradient descent optimization technique. The trained model is stored on the server. In the validation phase, it is imported to process the actual data to diagnose. This study has used Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset to train and test the model. The results obtained by the proposed model outperform many other approaches by attaining 98.73 % accuracy, 99.60% specificity, 99.43% sensitivity, and 99.48% precision.",
  "As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to spread, it remains unclear how vulnerable populations with preexisting health conditions like cancer have been affected.Between July and September of 2020, the authors conducted a cross-sectional study that surveyed 2661 patients with breast cancer who were registered in the Chicago Multiethnic Epidemiologic Breast Cancer Cohort and received 1300 responses (71.5% White patients and 22.4% Black patients). The survey measured the psychosocial well-being of participants before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and examined whether they experienced any type of financial challenges or treatment disruption.The results indicated that feelings of isolation increased significantly during the pandemic. Meanwhile, the overall median isolation/stress score was 1.2 on a scale from 0 (never) to 4 (always), which was not significantly different between White patients and Black patients. One-third of patients experienced some type of financial challenge during this time. Medicaid recipients, of whom almost 80% were Black, were more likely to experience financial challenges. In addition, approximately one-fourth of patients experienced difficulty getting treatment.This study indicates that the quality of life of patients with breast cancer and their scheduled treatments have been adversely affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings suggest that more support should be provided by hospital centers and the medical research community to patients with cancer during this challenging pandemic.The authors surveyed patients with breast cancer in Chicago using a questionnaire to examine how their lives have been affected during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The results indicate that the lives of patients with breast cancer and their scheduled treatments have been adversely affected during the pandemic. In addition, patients who were covered by Medicaid, most of whom were Black, were more likely to experience financial challenges. The findings suggest that hospital centers and the medical research community should reach out and provide more information to support patients with cancer during this challenging pandemic.",
  "The use of endocrine therapy for early-stage breast cancer, particularly aromatase inhibitor therapy has been associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis and fracture in clinical trials. We sought to validate this observation in real-world practice.We used health administrative data collected from post-menopausal women (aged \u226566 years) who were diagnosed with breast cancer and started on adjuvant endocrine therapy from 2005 to 2012. Patients were classified by use of either an aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen and followed until 2017 for a new diagnosis of an osteoporotic fracture. A multivariable analysis using a Cox proportional hazards model was adjusting for age, medical co-morbidities, medication use and duration of endocrine therapy.We identified 12,077 patients of whom 73% were treated with an aromatase inhibitor as compared to 27% with tamoxifen. Our multivariable analysis did not demonstrate any significant difference in the rate of osteoporotic fracture between patients treated with an aromatase inhibitor when compared with tamoxifen [Hazard ratio (HR)\u00a0=\u00a01.09; 95% confidence interval (CI)\u00a0=\u00a00.96-1.23, p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.18]. The 5-year rate of osteoporotic fracture for patients treated with either an aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen was 7.5% and 6.9%, respectively. A completed sensitivity analysis did observe a decreased risk of fracture associated with tamoxifen usage over time.We could not detect a significant difference in the rate of osteoporotic fracture among patients treated with an aromatase inhibitor versus tamoxifen. Nonetheless, the risk with tamoxifen was numerically lower and significantly decreased when accounting for total duration of endocrine therapy.",
  "Breast cancer is one of the most lethal types of cancer in women worldwide. The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is considered as a validated target in breast cancer therapy. Previously, we have used quantitative structure activity relationship QSAR equations and their associated pharmacophore models to screen for new promising HER2 structurally diverse inhibitory leads which were tested against HER2-overexpressing SKOV3 ovarian cancer cell line.In this study, we sought to explore the effect of most active ligands against different normal and breast cancer cell lines that represent different breast cancer subtypes with distinguished expression levels in HER2 and HER1.We have tested the promising compounds against SKBR3, MDA-MB-231, MCF7, human fibroblast, and MCF10 cell lines. To understand the inhibitory effects of the active ligands against HER2 over expressed breast cancer cell lines, all inhibitors and the control compound, lapatinib, were docked into the active site of HER2 enzyme performed using Ligand Fit docking engine and PMF scoring function.Five ligands exhibited promising results with relatively low IC<sub>50</sub> values on cells that amplify HER2 and high IC<sub>50</sub> on those that do not express such a receptor. The most potent compound (compound 13) showed an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.046\u00a0\u00b5M. To test their toxicity against normal cells, the active compounds were tested against both normal fibroblast and normal breast cancer cell MCF-10 and relatively high IC<sub>50</sub> values were scored. The IC<sub>50</sub> values on HER2 over-expressed breast cancer and normal fibroblast cells provided a promising safety index. Docking results showed the highest similarity in the binding site between the most active ligand and the lapatinib.Our pharmacophore model resulted in a high potent ligand that shows high potency against HER2 positive breast cancer and relatively low toxicity towards the normal human cells.",
  "Acrylamide is classified as a probable human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer but epidemiologic evidence on the carcinogenicity of acrylamide from dietary sources is limited.This study aimed to investigate the associations between dietary acrylamide and breast cancer risk in the NutriNet-Sant\u00e9 cohort, accounting for menopausal and hormone receptor status.This prospective cohort study included 80,597 French females (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD age at baseline: 40.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014 y) during a mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD follow-up of 8.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.3 y. Acrylamide intake was evaluated using repeated 24-h dietary records (n\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD\u00a0=\u00a05.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.0), linked to a comprehensive food composition database. Associations between acrylamide intake and breast cancer risk (overall, premenopausal, and postmenopausal) were assessed by Cox hazard models adjusted for known risk factors (sociodemographic, anthropometric, lifestyle, medical history, and nutritional factors).The mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD dietary acrylamide intake was 30.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a021.9 \u00b5g/d (main contributors: coffee, potato fries and chips, pastries, cakes, bread). During follow-up, 1016 first incident breast cancer cases were diagnosed (431 premenopausal, 585 postmenopausal). A borderline significant positive association was observed between dietary acrylamide exposure and breast cancer risk overall (HR for quartile 4 compared with 1: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.47) and a positive association was observed with premenopausal cancer (HRQ4vs.Q1: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.88). Restricted cubic spline analyses suggested evidence for nonlinearity of these associations, with higher HRs for intermediate (quartile 2) and high (quartile 4) exposures. Receptor-specific analyses revealed positive associations with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer (total and premenopausal). Acrylamide intake was not associated with postmenopausal breast cancer.Results from this large prospective cohort study suggest a positive association between dietary acrylamide and breast cancer risk, especially in premenopausal females, and provide new insights that support continued mitigation strategies to reduce the content of acrylamide in food.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03335644.",
  "Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. \"Breast cancer\" encompasses a broad spectrum of diseases (i.e., subtypes) with significant epidemiological, clinical, and biological heterogeneity. Each of these subtypes has a different natural history and prognostic profile. Although tumour staging (TNM classification) still provides valuable information in the overall management of breast cancer, the current reality is that clinicians must consider other biological and molecular factors that directly influence treatment decision-making, including extent of surgery, indication for chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and even radiotherapy (and treatment volumes). The management of breast cancer has changed radically in the last 15 years due to significant advances in our understanding of these tumours. While these changes have been extremely positive in terms of surgical and systemic management, they have also created significant uncertainties concerning integration of local and locoregional radiotherapy into the therapeutic scheme. In parallel, radiotherapy itself has also experienced major advances. Beyond the evident technological advances, new radiobiological concepts have emerged, and genomic data and other patient-specific factors must now be integrated into individualized treatment approaches. In this context, \"precision medicine\" seeks to provide an answer to these open questions and uncertainties. Although precision medicine has been much discussed in the last five years or so, the concept remains somewhat ambiguous, and it often appear to be used as a \"catch-all\" term. The present review aims to clarify the meaning of this term and, more importantly, to critically evaluate the role and impact of precision medicine on breast cancer radiotherapy. Finally, we will discuss the current and future of precision medicine in radiotherapy.",
  "Women with lower levels of serum selenium (Se) may have a worse survival in breast cancer than women with higher levels, despite no difference in incidence of the disease. Our study was conducted to test whether Se is associated with the aggressiveness of breast tumors. Both the risk of having a tumor characteristic associated with worse prognosis, as well as the overall and breast cancer-specific mortality, were studied. We identified breast cancer cases and controls within the Malm\u00f6 Diet and Cancer Study, a population-based cohort with 17\u2009035 women recruited between 1991 and 1996. Inclusion criteria were incident breast cancer. Exclusion criteria were carcinoma in situ and bilateral breast cancer. Controls were selected among breast cancer-free women both from matching (n = 694) as well as randomization (n = 492). After exclusion, 1066 cases remained and were compared to controls regarding their prediagnostic serum Se levels and subsequent risk of having a certain tumor characteristic or intrinsic subtype. We also followed breast cancer patients regarding overall and breast cancer-specific mortality, comparing different Se quartiles. No association between serum Se quartile and any tumor characteristic or intrinsic subtype was found. Lower overall mortality was found among women in the highest Se quartile compared to the lowest using an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model, hazard ratio 0.63 (95% confidence interval: 0.44-0.89). Similar results were seen for breast cancer-specific mortality, 0.60 (0.37-0.98). The results of our study support that Se is associated with a lower mortality in breast cancer, not related to established prognostic factors.",
  "Women with obesity are at higher risk for high-grade and/or advanced-stage breast cancer in comparison with women without obesity. Many women with a high body mass index (BMI) at breast cancer diagnosis experience further weight gain during and after treatment. This study investigated Black and White patient perspectives on conversations with their oncologists about weight and weight management.Focus groups using a virtual platform (Zoom) were conducted with women after primary treatment for stage I to III breast cancer who were 21 years or older and had a BMI \u2265 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> : 2 with Black women (n = 12) and 2 with White women (n = 14).Participants asked that their oncologists be \"transparent\" about weight gain as a potential side effect of their cancer treatment and how excess weight might affect their prognosis and survival. They asked to be \"seen as an individual\" to facilitate both person-centered and culturally appropriate conversations about behavioral changes needed for weight management. Participants urged clinicians to take the lead in initiating conversations about weight to underscore its importance in cancer care and survivorship. They welcomed actionable recommendations about nutrition and exercise from either the oncology clinician or a specialist. Participants offered specific suggestions on how clinicians could initiate weight-related conversations, beginning with questions eliciting patients' perspectives on their weight and lifestyle.Many women with early-stage breast cancer and obesity have concerns about weight and weight gain and urge their oncologists to use an active and personalized approach in recommending and supporting efforts at weight management.Focus group discussions with Black and White women with early-stage breast cancer and obesity have elicited patient perspectives on conversations with their oncologists about weight and weight management. Many patients have concerns about weight and weight gain and urge their oncologists to use an active and personalized approach in recommending and supporting efforts at weight management.",
  "Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) have been known to play significant functions in tumorigenesis and development. The association between PKM2 and NQO1 in breast cancer continues, however, to be unclear. In the present study, according to UALCAN and GEPIA database, the mRNA levels of PKM2 and NQO1 in breast primary tumor were significantly higher compared to normal breast tissue. Consonant with these findings, increased expression of both PKM2 and NQO1 were detected in clinical samples and BC cell lines. More importantly, consolidated high expression of NQO1 and PKM2 were obtained to be related with worse clinical stage, relapse, shorter relapse free survival (RFS), and poorer overall survival (OS) in human breast cancer. We subsequently found that knockdown of NQO1 reduced the protein level of PKM2 significantly. Moreover, deletion of PKM2 significantly reduced colony formation, migration and invasion of BC cells. A positive correlation between PKM2 and NQO1 expression was identified by immunohistochemical analyses of 108 specimens of breast cancer patients (rs = 0.60, P = 0.00). Finally, endogenous Co-IP demonstrated that PKM2 and NQO1 interact in breast cancer cells. The results of this study suggest that the correlation between NQO1 and PKM2 might play a critical role during breast tumourigenesis and serve as novel diagnostic biomarkers for breast cancer.",
  "There is an increasing incidence of breast cancer in India, especially among younger women. The study's main objective was to create awareness related to breast cancer and breast self-examination by community health workers and assess the effectiveness of improving knowledge and practice. Secondary objective was to conduct clinical breast examination (CBE) of women and prompt referral.An outcome evaluation of the Educational Interventional project was conducted in a hilly district of Uttarakhand. Twenty Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA) were identified and trained in breast cancer awareness, the procedure of breast self-examination, and screening methods. These ASHA's further created awareness among study participants (women above 30 years). A structured questionnaire on knowledge and practice was administered before and after educational intervention by ASHA workers. Clinical Breast Examination (CBE) camps were held for women at high risk for breast cancer who were referred to the Division of Breast Surgery, AIIMS Rishikesh, for further management.One thousand sixty-one females participated in health education sessions by ASHAs. There was an improvement in knowledge and practice regarding Breast Self-examination after health education intervention. A low prevalence of risk factors for breast cancer was found among attendees of the CBE camp. 3.2% of participants had abnormalities on breast examination needing further workup.In the pre-test assessment, we found a low awareness and practice regarding breast cancer which increased significantly among women after behavioral change intervention. The prevalence of risk factors for breast cancer was very low. Trained community health workers were found to be effective in raising awareness, selective screening, and prompt referral.",
  "Accumulating evidence has attracted attention to the androgen receptor (AR) as a biomarker and therapeutic target in breast cancer. We hypothesized that AR activity within the tumor has clinical implications and investigated whether androgen responsive serum factors might serve as a minimally invasive indicator of tumor AR activity.Based on a comprehensive gene expression analysis of an AR-positive, triple negative breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model, 163 dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-responsive genes were defined as an androgen responsive gene set. Among them, we focused on genes that were DHT-responsive that encode secreted proteins, namely KLK3, AZGP1 and PIP, that encode the secreted factors prostate specific antigen (PSA), zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein (ZAG) and prolactin induced protein (PIP), respectively. Using AR-positive breast cancer cell lines representing all breast cancer subtypes, expression of candidate factors was assessed in response to agonist DHT and antagonist enzalutamide. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed on publically available gene expression datasets from breast cancer patients to analyze the relationship between genes encoding the secreted factors and other androgen responsive gene sets in each breast cancer subtype.Anti-androgen treatment decreased proliferation in all cell lines tested representing various tumor subtypes. Expression of the secreted factors was regulated by AR activation in the majority of breast cancer cell lines. In GSEA, the candidate genes were positively correlated with an androgen responsive gene set across breast cancer subtypes.KLK3, AZGP1 and PIP are AR regulated and reflect tumor AR activity. Further investigations are needed to examine the potential efficacy of these factors as serum biomarkers.",
  "To assess whether contralateral parenchymal enhancement (CPE) on MRI is associated with gene expression pathways in ER+/HER2-breast cancer, and if so, whether such pathways are related to survival.Preoperative breast MRIs were analyzed of early ER+/HER2-breast cancer patients eligible for breast-conserving surgery included in a prospective observational cohort study (MARGINS). The contralateral parenchyma was segmented and CPE was calculated as the average of the top-10% delayed enhancement. Total tumor RNA sequencing was performed and gene set enrichment analysis was used to reveal gene expression pathways associated with CPE (N\u00a0=\u00a0226) and related to overall survival (OS) and invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) in multivariable survival analysis. The latter was also done for the METABRIC cohort (N\u00a0=\u00a01355).CPE was most strongly correlated with proteasome pathways (normalized enrichment statistic\u00a0=\u00a02.04, false discovery rate\u00a0= .11). Patients with high CPE showed lower tumor proteasome gene expression. Proteasome gene expression had a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.40 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.89, 2.16; P\u00a0=\u00a0.143) for OS in the MARGINS cohort and 1.53 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.08, 2.14; P\u00a0=\u00a0.017) for IDFS, in METABRIC proteasome gene expression had an HR of 1.09 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.01, 1.18; P\u00a0=\u00a0.020) for OS and 1.10 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.02, 1.18; P\u00a0=\u00a0.012) for IDFS.CPE was negatively correlated with tumor proteasome gene expression in early ER+/HER2-breast cancer patients. Low tumor proteasome gene expression was associated with improved survival in the METABRIC data.",
  "Research on psychosocial stress and risk of breast cancer has produced conflicting results. Few studies have assessed this relation by breast cancer subtype or specifically among Black women, who experience unique chronic stressors.We used prospective data from the Black Women's Health Study, an ongoing cohort study of 59,000 US Black women, to assess neighborhood- and individual-level psychosocial factors in relation to risk of breast cancer. We used factor analysis to derive two neighborhood score variables after linking participant addresses to US Census data (2000 and 2010) on education, employment, income and poverty, female-headed households, and Black race for all households in each residential block group. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for established breast cancer risk factors.During follow-up from 1995 to 2017, there were 2167 incident invasive breast cancer cases (1259 estrogen receptor positive (ER\u2009+); 687 ER negative (ER-)). For ER- breast cancer, HRs were 1.26 (95% CI 1.00-1.58) for women living in the highest quartile of neighborhood disadvantage relative to women in the lowest quartile, and 1.24 (95% CI 0.98-1.57) for lowest versus highest quartile of neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES). For ER+ breast cancer, living in the lowest quartile of neighborhood SES was associated with a reduced risk of ER+ breast cancer (HR\u2009=\u20090.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.98). With respect to individual-level factors, childhood sexual abuse (sexual assault\u2009\u2265\u20094 times vs. no abuse: HR\u2009=\u20091.35, 95% CI 1.01-1.79) and marital status (married/living together vs. single: HR\u2009=\u20091.29, 95% CI 1.08-1.53) were associated with higher risk of ER+, but not ER- breast cancer.Neighborhood disadvantage and lower neighborhood SES were associated with an approximately 25% increased risk of ER- breast cancer in this large cohort of Black women, even after control for multiple behaviors and lifestyle factors. Further research is need to understand the underlying reasons for these associations. Possible contributing factors are biologic responses to the chronic stress/distress experienced by individuals who reside in neighborhoods characterized by high levels of noise, crime and unemployment or the direct effects of environmental toxins.",
  "Breast cancer, a hormone-dependent tumour, generally includes four molecular subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, HER2 enriched and triple-negative) based on oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2. Multiple hormones in the body regulate the development of breast cancer. Endocrine therapy is one of the primary treatments for hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer, but endocrine resistance is the primary clinical cause of treatment failure. Prolactin (PRL) is a protein hormone secreted by the pituitary gland, mainly promoting mammary gland growth, stimulating and maintaining lactation. Previous studies suggest that high PRL levels can increase the risk of invasive breast cancer in women. The expression levels of PRL and PRLR in breast cancer cells and breast cancer tissues are elevated in most ER<sup>+</sup> and ER<sup>-</sup> tumours. PRL activates downstream signalling pathways and affects endocrine therapy resistance by combining with prolactin receptor (PRLR). In this review, we illustrated and summarized the correlations between endocrine therapy resistance in breast cancer and PRL, as well as the pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical practices. The study on PRL and its receptor would help explore reversing endocrine therapy-resistance for breast cancer.",
  "Locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer remains a challenge to treat. With emerging study results, it is important to interpret the available clinical data and apply the evidence offering the most effective treatment to the right patient. Poly(ADP Ribose) Polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are a new class of drug and their role in the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer is being established.To determine the efficacy, safety profile, and potential harms of Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The primary outcome of interest was overall survival; secondary outcomes included progression-free survival, tumour response rate, quality of life, and adverse events.On 8 June 2020, we searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE via OvidSP, Embase via OvidSP, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) search portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also searched proceedings from the major oncology conferences as well as scanned reference lists from eligible publications and contacted corresponding authors of trials for further information, where needed.We included randomised controlled trials on participants with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer comparing 1) chemotherapy in combination with PARP inhibitors, compared to the same chemotherapy without PARP inhibitors or 2) treatment with PARP inhibitors, compared to treatment with other chemotherapy. We included studies that reported on our primary outcome of overall survival and secondary outcomes including progression-free survival, tumour response rate, quality of life, and adverse events.We used standard methodological procedures defined by Cochrane. Summary statistics for the endpoints used hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for overall survival and progression-free survival, and odds ratios (OR) for response rate (RR) and toxicity.We identified 49 articles for qualitative synthesis, describing five randomised controlled trials that were included in the quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis). A sixth trial was assessed as eligible but had ended prematurely and no data were available for inclusion in our meta-analysis. Risk of bias was predominately low to unclear across all studies except in regards to performance bias (3/5 high risk) and detection bias for the outcomes of quality of life (2/2 high risk) and reporting of adverse events (3/5 high risk). High-certainty evidence shows there may be a small advantage in overall survival (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.00; 4 studies; 1435 patients). High-certainty evidence shows that PARP inhibitors offer an improvement in PFS in locally advanced/metastatic HER2-negative, BRCA germline mutated breast cancer patients (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.71; 5 studies; 1474 patients). There was no statistical heterogeneity for these outcomes. Subgroup analyses for PFS outcomes based on trial level data were performed for triple-negative breast cancer, hormone-positive and/or HER2-positive breast cancer, BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations, and patients who had received prior chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer or not. The subgroup analyses showed a persistent PFS benefit regardless of the subgroup chosen. Pooled analysis shows PARP inhibitors likely result in a moderate improvement in tumour response rate compared to other treatment arms (66.9% vs 48.9%; RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.54; 5 studies; 1185 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The most common adverse events reported across all five studies included neutropenia, anaemia and fatigue. Grade 3 or higher adverse events probably occur no less frequently in patients receiving PARP inhibitors (59.4% for PARP arm versus 64.5% for non-PARP arm, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.04; 5 studies; 1443 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Only two studies reported quality of life outcomes so this was not amenable to meta-analysis. However, both studies that did assess quality of life showed PARP inhibitors were superior compared to physician's choice of chemotherapy in terms of participant-reported outcomes.In people with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-negative, BRCA germline mutated breast cancer, PARP inhibitors offer an improvement in progression-free survival, and likely improve overall survival and tumour response rates. This systematic review provides evidence supporting the use of PARP inhibitors as part of the therapeutic strategy for breast cancer patients in this subgroup. The toxicity profile for PARP inhibitors is probably no worse than chemotherapy but more information is required regarding quality of life outcomes, highlighting the importance of collecting such data in future studies. Future studies should also be powered to detect clinically important differences in overall survival and could focus on the role of PARP inhibitors in other relevant breast cancer populations, including HER2-positive, BRCA-negative/homologous recombination repair-deficient and Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PDL1) positive.",
  "Mammographic density is an established breast cancer risk factor within many ethnically different populations. The distribution of mammographic density has been shown to be significantly lower in Western Australian Aboriginal women compared to age- and screening location-matched non-Aboriginal women. Whether mammographic density is a predictor of breast cancer risk in Aboriginal women is unknown.We measured mammographic density from 103 Aboriginal breast cancer cases and 327 Aboriginal controls, 341 non-Aboriginal cases, and 333 non-Aboriginal controls selected from the BreastScreen Western Australia database using the Cumulus software program. Logistic regression was used to examine the associations of percentage dense area and absolute dense area with breast cancer risk for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal women separately, adjusting for covariates.Both percentage density and absolute dense area were strongly predictive of risk in Aboriginal women with odds per adjusted standard deviation (OPERAS) of 1.36 (95% CI 1.09, 1.69) and 1.36 (95% CI 1.08, 1.71), respectively. For non-Aboriginal women, the OPERAS were 1.22 (95% CI 1.03, 1.46) and 1.26 (95% CI 1.05, 1.50), respectively.Whilst mean mammographic density for Aboriginal women is lower than non-Aboriginal women, density measures are still higher in Aboriginal women with breast cancer compared to Aboriginal women without breast cancer. Thus, mammographic density strongly predicts breast cancer risk in Aboriginal women. Future efforts to predict breast cancer risk using mammographic density or standardize risk-associated mammographic density measures should take into account Aboriginal status when applicable.",
  "To assess early changes in synthetic relaxometry after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for breast cancer and establish a model with contrast-free quantitative parameters for early prediction of pathological response.From March 2019 to January 2021, breast MRI were performed for a primary cohort of women with breast cancer before (n = 102) and after the first (n = 93) and second (n = 90) cycle of NAC. Tumor size, synthetic relaxometry (T1/T2 relaxation time [T1/T2], proton density), and ADC were obtained, and the changes after treatment were calculated. Prediction models were established by multivariate logistic regression; evaluated with discrimination, calibration, and clinical application; and compared with Delong tests, net reclassification (NRI), and integrated discrimination index (IDI). External validation was performed from February to June 2021 with an independent cohort of 35 patients.In the primary cohort, all parameters changed after early treatment. Synthetic relaxometry decreased to a greater degree in major histologic responders (MHR, Miller-Payne G4-5) compared with non-MHR (Miller-Payne G1-3). A model combining ADC after treatment, changes in T1 and tumor size, and cancer subtype achieved the highest AUC after the first (primary/validation cohort, 0.83/0.82) and second cycles (primary/validation cohort, 0.85/0.84). No difference of AUC (p \u2265 0.27), NRI (p \u2265 0.31), and IDI (p \u2265 0.32) was found between models with different cycles and size-measured sequences. Model calibration and decision curves demonstrated a good fitness and clinical benefit, respectively.Early reduction in synthetic relaxometry indicated pathological response to NAC. Contrast-free T1 and ADC combined with size and cancer subtype predicted effectively pathological response after one NAC cycle.\u2022 Synthetic MRI relaxometry changed after early neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which demonstrated pathological response for mass-like breast cancers. \u2022 Contrast-free quantitative parameters including T1 relaxation time and apparent diffusion coefficient, combined with tumor size and cancer subtype, stratified major histologic responders. \u2022 A contrast-free model predicted an early pathological response after the first treatment cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",
  "Estimates of contralateral breast cancer (CBC) risk in the modern treatment era by year of diagnosis and characteristics of the first breast cancer are needed to assess the impact of recent advances in breast cancer treatment and inform clinical decision making.We examined CBC risk among 419,818 women (age 30-84\u2009years) who were diagnosed with a first unilateral invasive breast cancer and survived \u2265\u20091\u2009year in the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program cancer registries from 1992 to 2015 (follow-up through 2016). CBC was defined as a second invasive breast cancer in the contralateral breast \u2265\u200912\u00a0months after the first breast cancer. We estimated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of CBC by year of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, and tumor characteristics for the first breast cancer. Cumulative incidence of CBC was calculated for women diagnosed with a first breast cancer in the recent treatment era (2004-2015, follow-up through 2016).Over a median follow-up of 8\u2009years (range 1-25\u2009years), 12,986 breast cancer patients developed CBC. Overall, breast cancer patients had approximately twice the risk of developing cancer in the contralateral breast when compared to that expected in the general population (SIR\u2009=\u20092.21, 95% CI\u2009=\u20092.17-2.25). SIRs for CBC declined by year of first diagnosis, irrespective of age at diagnosis and estrogen receptor (ER) status (p-trends <\u20090.001), but the strongest decline was after an ER-positive tumor. The 5-year cumulative incidence of CBC ranged from 1.01% (95% CI\u2009=\u20090.90-1.14%) in younger women (age\u2009<\u200950\u2009years) with a first ER-positive tumor to 1.89% (95% CI\u2009=\u20091.61-2.21%) in younger women with a first ER-negative tumor.Declines in CBC risk are consistent with continued advances in breast cancer treatment. The updated estimates of cumulative incidence inform breast cancer patients and clinicians on the risk of CBC and may help guide treatment decisions.",
  "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is highly expressed in certain cancer types and is involved in regulating the biological characteristics of cancer progression, including proliferation, metastasis, and drug resistance. Various medicines targeting EGFR have been developed and approved for several cancer types, such as lung and colon cancer. To date, however, EGFR inhibitors have not achieved satisfactory clinical results in breast cancer, which continues to be the most serious malignant tumor type in females. Therefore, clarifying the underlying mechanisms related to the ineffectiveness of EGFR inhibitors in breast cancer and developing new EGFR-targeted strategies (e.g., combination therapy) remain critical challenges. Various studies have demonstrated aberrant expression and maintenance of EGFR levels in breast cancer. In this review, we summarize the regulatory mechanisms underlying EGFR protein expression in breast cancer cells, including EGFR mutations, amplification, endocytic dysfunction, recycling acceleration, and degradation disorders. We also discuss potential therapeutic strategies that act directly or indirectly on EGFR, including reducing EGFR protein expression, treating the target protein to mediate precise clearance, and inhibiting non-EGFR signaling pathways. This review should provide new therapeutic perspectives for breast cancer patients with high EGFR expression.",
  "Secondary lymphoid tissues, such as the spleen and lymph nodes (LNs), contribute to breast cancer development and metastasis in both anti- and pro-tumoral directions. Although secondary lymphoid tissues have been extensively studied, very little is known about the immune conversion in mesenteric LNs (mLNs) during breast cancer development. Here, we demonstrate inflammatory immune conversion of mLNs in a metastatic 4T1 breast cancer model. Splenic T cells were significantly decreased and continuously suppressed IFN-\u03b3 production during tumor development, while myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were dramatically enriched. However, T cell numbers in the mLN did not decrease, and the MDSCs only moderately increased. T cells in the mLN exhibited conversion from a pro-inflammatory state with high IFN-\u03b3 expression to an anti-inflammatory state with high expression of IL-4 and IL-10 in early- to late-stages of breast cancer development. Interestingly, increased migration of CD103<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells (DCs) into the mLN, along with increased (1\u21923)-\u03b2-D-glucan levels in serum, was observed even in late-stage breast cancer. This suggests that CD103<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs could prime cancer-reactive T cells. Together, the data indicate that the mLN is an important lymphoid tissue contributing to breast cancer development.",
  "FAS can serve as both an oncogene and a suppresser in different malignancies, and the prognostic value of FAS remains controversial.The Oncomine database, KM-Plotter and bc-GenExMiner platform were adopted to analyze the prognostic value of FAS in breast cancer. Breast cancer tissue microarrays were further used to verify these data. The Cell Miner Tool was used to predict the value of FAS mRNA expression in predicting the efficacies of clinical drugs.We found that both FAS mRNA and protein expression level significantly reduced in breast carcinoma. In addition, high FAS expression indicates a better metastatic relapse-free survival. Interestingly, FAS was associated with a better prognosis in different subtypes of breast cancer patients, namely, only in grade II and III, lymph nodal positive or p53 wild-type patients. The data from the Cell Miner Tool revealed that FAS mRNA expression was correlated with the efficacy of the first-line chemotherapeutic taxane agents and target drugs including olaparib and everolimus.FAS expression correlates with a better prognosis in breast cancer and may provide an effective clinical strategy to predict the sensitivity of taxanes and targeted drugs.",
  "<b>BACKGROUND.</b> Higher categories of background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) increase breast cancer risk. However, current clinical BPE categorization is subjective. <b>OBJECTIVE.</b> Using a semiautomated segmentation algorithm, we calculated quantitative BPE measures and investigated the utility of individual features and feature pairs in significantly predicting subsequent breast cancer risk compared with radiologist-assigned BPE category. <b>METHODS.</b> In this retrospective case-control study, we identified 95 women at high risk of breast cancer but without a personal history of breast cancer who underwent breast MRI. Of these women, 19 subsequently developed breast cancer and were included as cases. Each case was age matched to four control patients (76 control patients total). Sociodemographic characteristics were compared between the cases and matched control patients using the Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test. From each dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI examination, quantitative fibroglandular tissue and BPE measures were computed by averaging enhancing voxels above enhancement ratio thresholds (0-100%), totaling the enhancing volume above thresholds (BPE volume in cm<sup>3</sup>), and estimating the percentage of enhancing tissue above thresholds relative to total breast volume (BPE%) on each gadolinium-enhanced phase. For the 91 imaging features generated, we compared predictive performance using conditional logistic regression with 80:20 hold-out cross validation and ROC curve analysis. ROC AUC was the figure of merit. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were also computed. All feature pairs were exhaustively searched to identify those with the highest AUC and Youden index. A DeLong test was used to compare predictive performance (AUCs). <b>RESULTS.</b> Women subsequently diagnosed with breast cancer were more likely to have mild, moderate, or marked BPE (odds ratio, 3.0; 95% CI, 0.9-10.0; <i>p</i> = .07). According to ROC curve analysis, a BPE category threshold greater than minimal resulted in a maximized AUC (0.62) in distinguishing cases from control patients. Compared with BPE category, the first gadolinium-enhanced (phase 1) BPE% at the 30% and 40% enhancement ratio thresholds yielded significantly higher AUC values of 0.85 (<i>p</i> = .0007) and 0.84 (<i>p</i> = .0004), respectively. Feature combinations showed similar AUC values with improved sensitivity. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> Preliminary data indicate that quantitative BPE measures may outperform radiologist-assigned category in breast cancer risk prediction. <b>CLINICAL IMPACT.</b> Future risk prediction models that incorporate quantitative measures warrant additional investigation.",
  "The genotype of Fanconi Anemia complementation group M (FANCM) was previously found to be associated with breast cancer risk in several populations. Here, we studied the expression of FANCM and its correlation with clinical characteristics in Chinese patients with breast cancer.We performed an immunohistochemical study of FANCM protein in clinical breast cancer tissues from 310 patients along with 44 adjacent tissues.FANCM protein level is lower in triple-negative breast cancer tissues than in other subtypes (P\u00a0=\u00a00.008). In addition, high FANCM expression correlated with pathology type IDC (P\u00a0=\u00a00.040), estrogen receptor positive (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), progesterone receptor positive (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), and low Ki-67 status (P\u00a0=\u00a00.003). Multivariate analysis revealed that FANCM status was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P\u00a0=\u00a00.017) in luminal B breast cancer.FANCM levels are significantly associated with different subtypes of human breast cancer. Specifically, FANCM could play a role in the progression of luminal B breast cancer.",
  "Breast cancer (BRCA) is a malignant tumor with high morbidity and mortality, which is a threat to women's health worldwide. Ferroptosis is closely related to the occurrence and development of breast cancer. Here, we aimed to establish a ferroptosis-related prognostic gene signature for predicting patients' survival.Gene expression profile and corresponding clinical information of patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-penalized Cox regression analysis model was utilized to construct a multigene signature. The Kaplan-Meier (K-M) and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to validate the predictive effect of the prognostic signature. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes, Genomes (KEGG) pathway and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) were performed for patients between the high-risk and low-risk groups divided by the median value of risk score.We constructed a prognostic signature consisted of nine ferroptosis-related genes (ALOX15, CISD1, CS, GCLC, GPX4, SLC7A11, EMC2, G6PD and ACSF2). The Kaplan-Meier curves validated the fine predictive accuracy of the prognostic signature (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC curves manifested that the ferroptosis-related signature had moderate predictive power. GO and KEGG functional analysis revealed that immune-related responses were largely enriched, and immune cells, including activated dendritic cells (aDCs), dendritic cells (DCs), T-helper 1 (Th1), were higher in high-risk groups (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Oppositely, type I IFN response and type II IFN response were lower in high-risk groups (p\u2009<\u20090.001).Our study indicated that the ferroptosis-related prognostic signature gene could serve as a novel biomarker for predicting breast cancer patients' prognosis. Furthermore, we found that immunotherapy might play a vital role in therapeutic schedule based on the level and difference of immune-related cells and pathways in different risk groups for breast cancer patients.",
  "In 2017, breast cancer became the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in the US. After lung cancer, breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women. The breast consists of several components, including milk storage glands, milk ducts made of epithelial cells, adipose tissue, and stromal tissue. Mammographic density (MD) is based on the proportion of stromal, epithelial, and adipose tissue. Women with high MD have more stromal and epithelial cells and less fatty adipose tissue, and are more likely to develop breast cancer in their lifetime compared to women with low MD. Because of this correlation, high MD is an independent risk factor for breast cancer. Further, mammographic screening is less effective in detecting suspicious lesions in dense breast tissue, which can lead to late-stage diagnosis. Molecular differences between dense and non-dense breast tissues explain the underlying biological reasons for why women with dense breasts are at a higher risk for developing breast cancer. The goal of this review is to highlight the current molecular understanding of MD, its association with breast cancer risk, the demographics pertaining to MD, and the environmental factors that modulate MD. Finally, we will review the current legislation regarding the disclosure of MD on a traditional screening mammogram and the supplemental screening options available to women with dense breast tissue.",
  "The purpose of this study was to identify independent prognostic factors for breast cancer patients with T1-2 tumors and 1-3 positive lymph nodes, and discuss the role of postmastectomy radiotherapy(PMRT) in these patients.Between January 2005 and December 2015, the data on 840 eligible patients with breast cancer were retrospectively reviewed. Of these patients, 368 women received PMRT and 472 did not. The endpoints were locoregional recurrence (LRR) and distant metastasis (DM).With a median follow-up of 62.0\u00a0months, multivariate analysis identified the following independent risk factors for increased LRR: tumor size\u2009\u2265\u20094\u00a0cm (HR: 2.994, 95% CI: 1.190-7.535, P\u2009=\u20090.020), ER- and PR-negative tumor (HR: 2.540, 95% CI: 1.165-5.537, P\u2009=\u20090.019), preoperative high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (HR: 4.716, 95% CI: 1.776-12.528, P\u2009=\u20090.002)and low neutrophil-to-monocyte ratio (NMR) (HR: 0.231, 95% CI: 0.084-0.633, P\u2009=\u20090.004). And independent risk factors for increased DM: ER- and PR-negative tumor (HR: 2.540, 95% CI: 1.880-5.625, P\u2009=\u20090.000), high NLR (HR: 2.693, 95% CI: 1.426-5.084, P\u2009=\u20090.002) and low NMR (HR: 0.460, 95% CI: 0.257-0.824, P\u2009=\u20090.009). The high-risk patients (\u2265\u20092 risk factors) had worse LRRFS and DFS than low-risk patients (0-1 risk factor) (all, P\u2009<\u20090.05). In the subgroup analysis, both low- and high-risk patients received PMRT had better LRRFS and DFS than those who without PMRT (all, P\u2009<\u20090.05), and the high-risk patients received PMRT had similar 5-year rates of LRRFS and DFS than low-risk patients who without PMRT (94.5 vs. 94.3%, P\u2009=\u20090.402; 83.4 vs.87.4%, P\u2009=\u20090.877, respectively).Tumor size, ER/PR status, preoperative NLR and NMR were independent predictors of risk of recurrence. PMRT could improve locoregional control even in low-risk subgroup of breast cancer patients with T1-2 tumors and 1-3 positive lymph nodes significantly.",
  "To investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in combination with pertuzumab in Japanese patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer.Patients with HER2-positive advanced or recurrent breast cancer who had received trastuzumab and chemotherapy-containing therapies were eligible. Patients received T-DM1 (3.6\u00a0mg/kg) with full-dose pertuzumab (a loading dose of 840\u00a0mg and then 420\u00a0mg) intravenously every 3\u00a0weeks. This study was registered at the Japan Pharmaceutical Information Center-Clinical Trials Information (JapicCTI-101234).Six patients enrolled in this study. The median duration of treatment was 11 (range 1-32) cycles. The most common treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) for any grade was diarrhea. Grade 3 or greater TEAEs included aspartate aminotransferase increased, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decreased, and neutrophil count decreased. The dose-limiting toxicity of grade 3 LVEF decreased was observed in one patient during cycle 1; however, it resolved within 30\u00a0days. The pharmacokinetic parameters of T-DM1 and pertuzumab were not affected by co-administration of the drugs. The best overall response included a partial response (PR) in 3 patients (50%) and stable disease (SD) in 2 patients (33%).The combination of T-DM1 and pertuzumab was tolerated and showed exploratory efficacy in Japanese patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.",
  "There are numerous biomarkers which may have potential predictive and prognostic significance in breast cancer. This is extremely important in older adults, who may opt for less aggressive therapy. This work outlines the literature on biological assessment outside of standard biomarkers (defined as ER, PgR, HER2, Ki67) in women\u2009\u2265\u200965\u00a0years with primary operable invasive breast cancer, to determine which additional biomarkers are relevant to outcome in older women.Medline and Embase databases were searched. Studies were eligible if included\u2009\u2265\u200950 patients aged\u2009\u2265\u200965\u00a0years; stratified results by age; measured a biomarker outside of standard assay and reported patient data.A total of 12 studies were appraised involving 5000 patients, measuring 28 biomarkers. The studies were extremely varied in methodology and outcome but three themes emerged: 1. Differences in biomarker expression between younger and older women, indicating that breast cancer in older women is generally less aggressive compared to younger women; 2. Relationship of biomarker expression with survival, suggesting biomarkers which may exclusively predict response to primary treatment in older women; 3. Association of biomarker with chemotherapy, suggesting that older patients should not be declined chemotherapy based on age alone.There is evidence to support further investigation of B-cell lymphoma (BCL2), liver kinase (LK)B1, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), cytoplasmic cyclin-E, mucin (MUC)1 and cytokeratins (CKs) as potential predictive or prognostic markers in older women with breast cancer undergoing surgery. Studies exploring these biomarkers in larger cohorts and in women undergoing non-operative therapies are required.",
  "Endocrine therapy resistance in advanced breast cancer remains a significant clinical problem that may be overcome with the use of histone deacetylase inhibitors such as entinostat. The ENCORE301 phase II study reported improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with the addition of entinostat to the steroidal aromatase inhibitor (AI) exemestane in advanced hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer.E2112 is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study that enrolled men or women with advanced HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer whose disease progressed after nonsteroidal AI. Participants were randomly assigned to exemestane 25 mg by mouth once daily and entinostat (EE) or placebo (EP) 5 mg by mouth once weekly. Primary end points were PFS by central review and OS. Secondary end points included safety, objective response rate, and lysine acetylation change in peripheral blood mononuclear cells between baseline and cycle 1 day 15.Six hundred eight patients were randomly assigned during March 2014-October 2018. Median age was 63 years (range 29-91), 60% had visceral disease, and 84% had progressed after nonsteroidal AI in metastatic setting. Previous treatments included chemotherapy (60%), fulvestrant (30%), and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (35%). Most common grade 3 and 4 adverse events in the EE arm included neutropenia (20%), hypophosphatemia (14%), anemia (8%), leukopenia (6%), fatigue (4%), diarrhea (4%), and thrombocytopenia (3%). Median PFS was 3.3 months (EE) versus 3.1 months (EP; hazard ratio = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.13; <i>P</i> = .30). Median OS was 23.4 months (EE) versus 21.7 months (EP; hazard ratio = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.21; <i>P</i> = .94). Objective response rate was 5.8% (EE) and 5.6% (EP). Pharmacodynamic analysis confirmed target inhibition in entinostat-treated patients.The combination of exemestane and entinostat did not improve survival in AI-resistant advanced HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.",
  "Chemotherapy is the standard treatment for breast cancer; however, the response to chemotherapy is disappointingly low. Here, we investigated the alternative therapeutic efficacy of novel combination treatment with necroptosis-inducing small molecules to overcome chemotherapeutic resistance in tyrosine aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (YARS)-positive breast cancer.Pre-chemotherapeutic needle biopsy of 143 invasive ductal carcinomas undergoing the same chemotherapeutic regimen was subjected to proteomic analysis. Four different machine learning algorithms were employed to determine signature protein combinations. Immunoreactive markers were selected using three common candidate proteins from the machine-learning algorithms and verified by immunohistochemistry using 123 cases of independent needle biopsy FFPE samples. The regulation of chemotherapeutic response and necroptotic cell death was assessed using lentiviral YARS overexpression and depletion 3D spheroid formation assay, viability assays, LDH release assay, flow cytometry analysis, and transmission electron microscopy. The ROS-induced metabolic dysregulation and phosphorylation of necrosome complex by YARS were assessed using oxygen consumption rate analysis, flow cytometry analysis, and 3D cell viability assay. The therapeutic roles of SMAC mimetics (LCL161) and a pan-BCL2 inhibitor (ABT-263) were determined by 3D cell viability assay and flow cytometry analysis. Additional biologic process and protein-protein interaction pathway analysis were performed using Gene Ontology annotation and Cytoscape databases.YARS was selected as a potential biomarker by proteomics-based machine-learning algorithms and was exclusively associated with good response to chemotherapy by subsequent immunohistochemical validation. In 3D spheroid models of breast cancer cell lines, YARS overexpression significantly improved chemotherapy response via phosphorylation of the necrosome complex. YARS-induced necroptosis sequentially mediated mitochondrial dysfunction through the overproduction of ROS in breast cancer cell lines. Combination treatment with necroptosis-inducing small molecules, including a SMAC mimetic (LCL161) and a pan-BCL2 inhibitor (ABT-263), showed therapeutic efficacy in YARS-overexpressing breast cancer cells.Our results indicate that, before chemotherapy, an initial screening of YARS protein expression should be performed, and YARS-positive breast cancer patients might consider the combined treatment with LCL161 and ABT-263; this could be a novel stepwise clinical approach to apply new targeted therapy in breast cancer patients in the future.",
  "Radiotherapy has an essential role in breast cancer treatment. However, tumor cells may be resistant to radiotherapy. Noncoding RNAs are considered regulators of different pathways which modulate radiotherapy. This systematic review classifies long noncoding RNAs, and microRNAs precipitated in the radiation response of breast cancer patients. A total of 14 microRNAs and 8 long noncoding RNAs were studied in this review. MiR-22, miR-200\u00a0c, Let7, and LINP1 as tumor suppressors increase the effect of radiotherapy in BC. However, some noncoding RNAs such as HOTAIR, NEAT1, and miR-21 are precipitated in radio-resistance breast cancers. Significant changes in the pattern of noncoding RNAs expression before and after radiotherapy make them a good candidate for the prognosis and prediction of radiotherapy response. MiR-21 and miR-182 can promote radio-resistance via cancer stem cells. At last, the molecular mechanisms initiating radio-resistance were also examined to find the candidate noncoding RNAs for the development of radiation-sensitized agents.",
  "To study the association of risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RRBSO) and breast cancer risk among BRCA pathogenic sequence variants (PSV).Jewish Israeli BRCA carriers who underwent RRBSO were matched with those who did not-by the mutated gene and year of birth (\u00b11\u00a0year). Breast cancer rates were compared.Overall, 127 pairs met the inclusion criteria, 79 (60.6%) pairs harbored BRCA1 PSV and 50 (39.4%) pairs harbored BRCA2 PSV. Median follow up was 8.7\u00a0years (interquartile range 4.6-16.1\u00a0years). Breast cancer rate for all BRCA carriers combined was not affected by RRBSO (RRBSO 21 [16.5%] versus no RRBSO 31 [24.4%], hazard ratio [HR] for breast cancer 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.33-1.14, P\u00a0=\u00a00.127). No association between RRBSO and breast cancer incidence was noted among BRCA1 PSV carriers. In BRCA2 PSV carriers, RRBSO was associated with a decreased overall breast cancer incidence (HR 0.20, 95% CI 0.44-0.91, P\u00a0=\u00a00.038), as well as after 5, 10, 15, and 20\u00a0years. Hormone replacement therapy was used by 62 PSV carriers, 52 in the RRBSO group and 10 in the no-RRBSO group and did not affect breast cancer risk (P\u00a0=\u00a00.463).RRBSO is associated with breast cancer risk reduction in Jewish Israeli BRCA2 PSV carriers. Risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was associated with breast cancer risk reduction in Jewish Israeli BRCA2 pathogenic sequence variant carriers.",
  "The US Preventative Services Task Force assessed the efficacy of breast cancer screening according to the sum of its benefits and disadvantages. We estimate that the balance of the benefits and disadvantages varies among women depending on their demographic background.Between March 2016 and March 2017, we conducted a questionnaire survey among Japanese women who underwent population-based or opportunistic breast cancer screening at our multicenter institutions. We investigated the behavior modification among women after being informed about the benefits and disadvantages of breast cancer screening depending on their demographic background.Out of 3032 questionnaires that were returned, 2936 (96.8%) were evaluated. The percentage of women with prior knowledge about the benefits and disadvantages of breast cancer screening before reading the leaflets that we created was 24%. However, 95% of the women were willing to undergo screening next time, despite knowing the disadvantages. Regarding overdiagnosis, the young women tended to choose usual treatment, and the elderly women tended to choose active surveillance. In response to the question on the significance of screening, the young women wished to avoid death by breast cancer; whereas, the elderly women wished to live a safe life.Our results indicate that the information of disadvantages does not lead to a reduction in screening rates. Additionally, we found that the balance between the benefits and disadvantages of breast cancer screening varies among women depending on their demographic background, especially age.",
  "Cancer is a major cause of death worldwide and most of the therapeutic approaches are relatively ineffective in eliminating cancer especially due to drug resistance. As an alternative, therapy with live microorganisms can induce a robust proinflammatory and anti-cancer immune response in the microenvironment of the tumor. In the present study, we aimed to establish a model for taking the advantages of immune responses against intracellular protozoan parasites for cancer treatment.Leishmania infantum and L. tropica were used in our study as agents of visceral and cutaneous forms of the infection, respectively. After establishing 4T1 breast cancer in mice groups, live-attenuated L. infantum (At-Li) and live-attenuated L. tropica (At-Lt) treatments were performed and results were evaluated according to tumor volume, immune markers and histological examination.Live-attenuated Leishmania strains regressed 4T1-breast cancer in mice and are nonpathogenic, and these strains induce an immune response against 4T1 breast cancer. It is shown that At-Lt is found to be more effective than At-Li in breast cancer treatment using different methods included in the study as analyses of immune parameters, and histopathological examination in tumor tissue besides spleen cells. The tumor grew more slowly by the immune-stimulant effect of live-attenuated Leishmania parasites.This promising therapy should be investigated for optimization in further studies with different cancer types and L. tropica may be designed to express antigens to enhance tumor antigen-specific responses, which may further improve efficacy and immune memory development.",
  "Despite today's advances in the treatment of cancer, breast cancer-related mortality remains high, in part due to the lack of effective targeted therapies against breast tumor types that do not respond to standard treatments. Therefore, identifying additional breast cancer molecular targets is urgently needed. Super-enhancers are large regions of open chromatin involved in the overactivation of oncogenes. Thus, inhibition of super-enhancers has become a focus in clinical trials for its therapeutic potential. Here, we aimed to identify novel super-enhancer dysregulated genes highly associated with breast cancer patients' poor prognosis and negative response to treatment.Using existing datasets containing super-enhancer-associated genes identified in breast tumors and public databases comprising genomic and clinical information for breast cancer patients, we investigated whether highly expressed super-enhancer-associated genes correlate to breast cancer patients' poor prognosis and to patients' poor response to therapy. Our computational findings were experimentally confirmed in breast cancer cells by pharmacological SE disruption and gene silencing techniques.We bioinformatically identified two novel super-enhancer-associated genes - NSMCE2 and MAL2 - highly upregulated in breast tumors, for which high RNA levels significantly and specifically correlate with breast cancer patients' poor prognosis. Through in-vitro pharmacological super-enhancer disruption assays, we confirmed that super-enhancers upregulate NSMCE2 and MAL2 transcriptionally, and, through bioinformatics, we found that high levels of NSMCE2 strongly associate with patients' poor response to chemotherapy, especially for patients diagnosed with aggressive triple negative and HER2 positive tumor types. Finally, we showed that decreasing NSMCE2 gene expression increases breast cancer cells' sensitivity to chemotherapy treatment.Our results indicate that moderating the transcript levels of NSMCE2 could improve patients' response to standard chemotherapy consequently improving disease outcome. Our approach offers a new avenue to identify a signature of tumor specific genes that are not frequently mutated but dysregulated by super-enhancers. As a result, this strategy can lead to the discovery of potential and novel pharmacological targets for improving targeted therapy and the treatment of breast cancer.",
  "Upper-limb lymphedema is a well-known complication of breast cancer and its treatment. This retrospective cohort study aims to determine what risk factors affect breast cancer-related lymphedema in patients with breast cancer.This retrospective study comprised patients diagnosed with breast cancer and who underwent surgery at Wakayama Medical University Hospital between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2018. Assessed factors using univariate and multivariate analyses were patient-related factors (age, gender, and BMI), breast cancer-related factors (tumor size, nodal status, histology, tumor location, and intrinsic subtype), and treatment-related factors (type of surgery, application, timing and regimen of chemotherapy, and application of radiotherapy).This study included 1041 patients. BMI did not affect the onset of breast cancer-related lymphedema. There were only six sentinel lymph node biopsy cases in the breast cancer-related lymphedema group (6.6%). In cases of axillary lymph node dissection, adjuvant chemotherapy was marginally associated with increased risk of breast cancer-related lymphedema compared to no chemotherapy (HR 2.566; 95% CI 0.955-6.892; p\u2009=\u20090.0616). Among anti-cancer agents, docetaxel (HR 3.790; 95% CI 1.413-10.167; p\u2009=\u20090.0081) and anti-HER2 therapy (HR 2.507; 95% CI 1.083-5.803; p\u2009=\u20090.0318) were associated with increased risk of lymphedema according to multivariate analysis. Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy did not affect the onset of breast cancer-related lymphedema. Radiotherapy (HR 2.525; 95% CI 1.364-4.676; p\u2009=\u20090.0032) was an important risk factor for breast cancer-related lymphedema.Axillary lymph node dissection, radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy, especially docetaxel, were risk factors for breast cancer-related lymphedema, but BMI and neo-adjuvant chemotherapy were not.",
  "In Germany, it is currently recommended that women start mammographic breast cancer screening at age 50. However, recently updated guidelines state that for women younger than 50 and older than 70 years of age, screening decisions should be based on individual risk. International clinical guidelines recommend starting screening when a woman's 5-year risk of breast cancer exceeds 1.7%. We thus compared the performance of the current age-based screening practice with an alternative risk-adapted approach using data from a German population representative survey. We found that 10,498,000 German women ages 50-69 years are eligible for mammographic screening based on age alone. Applying the 5-year risk threshold of 1.7% to individual breast cancer risk estimated from a model that considers a woman's reproductive and personal characteristics, 39,000 German women ages 40-49 years would additionally be eligible. Among those women, the number needed to screen to detect one breast cancer case, NNS, was 282, which was close to the NNS = 292 among all 50- to 69-year-old women. In contrast, NNS = 703 for the 113,000 German women ages 50-69 years old with 5-year breast cancer risk <0.8%, the median 5-year breast cancer risk for German women ages 45-49 years, which we used as a low-risk threshold. For these low-risk women, longer screening intervals might be considered to avoid unnecessary diagnostic procedures. In conclusion, we show that risk-adapted mammographic screening could benefit German women ages 40-49 years who are at elevated breast cancer risk and reduce cost and burden among low-risk women ages 50-69 years. PREVENTION RELEVANCE: We show that a risk-based approach to mammography screening for German women can help detect breast cancer in women ages 40-49 years with increased risk and reduce screening costs and burdens for low-risk women ages 50-69 years. However, before recommending a particular implementation of a risk-based mammographic screening approach, further investigations of models and thresholds used are needed.",
  "A prior history of breast cancer is a risk factor for the subsequent development of primary peritoneal, epithelial ovarian, and fallopian tubal (POFT) cancers. This study aimed to estimate the incidence of secondary POFT malignancy in breast cancer patients and the clinical outcomes of primary and secondary POFT cancer.We searched the Korea Central Cancer Registry to find patients with primary and secondary POFT cancer who had breast cancer in 1999-2017. The incidence rate and standardized incidence ratio were calculated. Additionally, we compared the overall survival of patients with primary and secondary POFT cancer.Based on the age-standardized rate, the incidence of second primary POFT cancer after breast cancer was 0.0763 per 100,000 women, which increased in Korea between 1999 and 2017. Among the 30,366 POFT cancer patients, 25,721 were primary POFT cancer only, and 493 had secondary POFT cancer after a breast cancer diagnosis. Second primary POFT cancer patients were older at the time of diagnosis (55 vs. 53, p < 0.001) and had a larger proportion of serous histology (68.4% vs. 51.2%, p < 0.001) than patients with primary POFT. There were no differences between the two groups in tumor stage at diagnosis. The 5-year overall survival rates were 60.2% and 56.3% for primary and secondary POFT cancer, respectively (p=0.216).The incidence of second primary POFT cancer after breast cancer increased in Korea between 1999 and 2017. Besides, second primary POFT cancer patients were diagnosed at older ages and had more serous histology.",
  "Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in women. Although the mortality rate of breast cancer has fallen over the past 10\u2009years, effective treatments that reduce the occurrence of breast cancer metastasis remain lacking. In this study, we explored the role of receptor for hyaluronan mediated motility (RHAMM) and the associated signaling pathway in cell migration in luminal A breast cancer. We first examined RHAMM expression levels using human breast tissue microarray and patient breast tissues. We then studied the role of RHAMM in migration in luminal A breast cancer using loss-of-function and gain-of-function strategies in in\u2009vitro models and confirmed these findings in an in\u2009vivo model. Finally, we investigated signaling molecules that play a role in cell migration using western blot. Our results demonstrated the following: (a) RHAMM shows high expression levels in malignant breast tissue, (b) RHAMM shows low expression levels in luminal A breast cancer compared to other subtypes of breast cancer, (c) RHAMM inhibits cell migration in luminal A breast cancer, and (d) RHAMM inhibits cell migration via the AKT/GSK3\u03b2/Snail axis in luminal A breast cancer. This study demonstrates a novel role of RHAMM in cell migration in luminal A breast cancer and suggests that therapeutic strategies involving RHAMM should be considered for various subtypes of breast cancer.",
  "Complications of breast cancer treatment can cause physical and psychosocial distress in patients. Yoga demonstrates substantial potential as a supportive therapy for patients with breast cancer. Our aim is to conduct a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of yoga in enhancing the quality of life (QoL) of patients with breast cancer.We searched for studies published before March 2020 in the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. Individual effect sizes were standardized, and the pooled effect size was calculated using a random effect model. Measured outcomes included QoL, anxiety and depression, stress, fatigue, pain severity, and sleep quality.In total, 26 trials involving 2069 patients were reviewed. Significant enhancement in QoL was observed immediately after the yoga intervention. The pooled mean differences in social (weighted mean difference [WMD]: 1.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.12-2.61), emotional (WMD: 1.46, 95% CI 0.26-2.66), and functional well-being (WMD: 2.04, 95% CI 0.21-3.87) were significantly higher in the yoga group than in the control group. Patients practicing yoga exhibited significant improvements in physical well-being, mental well-being, and sleep quality as well as reductions in anxiety, depression, stress, fatigue, and pain severity after the intervention.Yoga may enhance QoL in patients with breast cancer experiencing post-treatment complications. Therefore, we recommend yoga as a supportive therapy for patients with breast cancer to relieve post-treatment distress.",
  "Breast cancer, the most common invasive cancer and cause of cancer-related death in women worldwide, is a multifactorial, complex disease, and many molecular players and mechanisms underlying the complexity of its clinical behavior remain unknown.To explore the molecular features of breast cancer, quantitative proteome and succinylome analyses in breast cancer were extensively studied using quantitative proteomics techniques, anti-succinyl lysine antibody-based affinity enrichment, and high-resolution LC-MS/MS analysis.Our study is the first to detect the regulation of lysine succinylation in breast cancer progression. We identified a novel mechanism by which the pentose phosphate pathway and the endoplasmic reticulum protein processing pathway might be regulated via lysine succinylation in their core enzymes.These results expand our understanding of tumorigenesis mechanisms and provide a basis for further characterization of the pathophysiological roles in breast cancer progression, laying a foundation for innovative and novel breast cancer drugs and therapies.",
  "Breast cancer is more likely to metastasize to the bone. Previous researches have revealed that the vitamin D receptor (VDR) contributes to breast cancer progression and bone metastasis in mouse and human breast cells, and hairless (Hr) protein interacts with VDR in the mammalian hair cycle. This study aimed to explore the expression of VDR/Hr in breast cancer, and the correlation between VDR/Hr and prognosis, bone metastasis, and metastasis-related prognosis.The expression of VDR and Hr was analyzed on 119 breast cancer tissues and corresponding normal breast tissue from each of the breast cancer samples by immunohistochemistry staining, and the databases were supplemented as well.The expression of the VDR protein was significantly decreased in breast cancer patients (p < 0.05), inversely, the UALCAN (p = 0.000) and GEPIA (p > 0.05) databases showed that the VDR mRNA expression tended to be higher in tumor tissues. The Hr protein was expressed at a low level within breast cancer specimens (p < 0.05), which was in agreement with the level of Hr mRNA in UALCAN (p = 0.005) and GEPIA (p > 0.05). The protein levels of VDR and Hr were positively correlated (p > 0.05), while the mRNA levels suggested a close relationship with GEPIA (p < 0.05). Low expression of Hr protein displayed a tendency for longer overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS), and its mRNA data also revealed the same trend in the Kaplan-Meier dataset (both p > 0.05). However, VDR protein and mRNA with low expression had markedly shorter OS and RFS (both p < 0.05). The downregulation of VDR protein was significantly associated with an advanced stage (p < 0.05). Low VDR protein was an independent risk factor for poor prognosis (p < 0.05) and was negatively correlated with bone metastasis (p < 0.05). VDR protein and mRNA levels were both downregulated in breast cancer with bone metastasis (both p < 0.05). The area under ROC curve (AUC) for VDR protein expression to identify patients with bone metastasis was 0.661 (p < 0.05) and the AUC for VDR level to predict 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year OS was 0.621, 0.664, and 0.805 in patients with bone metastasis, respectively (p < 0.05). VDR with low expression accelerated bone metastasis and metastasis-related poor survival (both p < 0.05).VDR expression is a notable prognostic factor in primary breast cancer patients for predicting bone metastases and unfavorable clinical outcome.",
  "This study aimed at investigating the real-world prognostic impact of systemic treatment in older patients with stage II/III breast cancer (BC).This retrospective cohort study included patients with stage II/III primary BC, aged \u226555 years, and registered in the Japanese Breast Cancer Registry from 2004 to 2011. The clinicopathological characteristics, treatments, and prognosis of patients aged \u226575 years (older) were compared to those of younger patients.In total, 56,093 patients (12,727, \u226575 years; 17,860, 65-74 years; 25,506, 55-64 years) were enrolled. In the older group, 9.2% with a luminal (hormone receptor [HR]+/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]-), 32.9% with a triple-negative (TN, HR-/HER2-), and 27.4% with a HER2-positive (any-HR/HER2+) receptor were administered chemotherapy. In those with luminal cancer, the 5-year breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) was approximately 95% in all age groups. Meanwhile, among those with TN and HER2-positive BC, the older group had a poorer BCSS. The 5-year overall survival (OS) was also poorer in the older group across all subtypes. Among older patients matched using clinicopathological factors, chemotherapy use was associated with improved OS in the luminal and HER2-positive subtypes.Chemotherapy use was lower among older patients with stage II/III breast cancer. Those with TN and HER2-positive BC had a lower BCSS than their younger counterparts. Chemotherapy may be beneficial in improving the OS in older patients with luminal and HER2-positive BCs. Treatment for older patients should be individualized, based on tumor-related factors, quality of life, and the patient's health status.",
  "Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the world, and 5-year survival rate of metastatic breast cancer is about 20%. The treatment of metastatic breast cancer is mainly chemotherapy, endocrine therapy and targeted therapy. However, after multiline treatment, patients with MBC especially the triple negative breast cancer face the problem of drug resistance. Tumor angiogenesis theory suggests that blocking angiogenesis can inhibit tumor growth and migration. Based on this, angiogenesis treatment strategy is proposed. Antiangiogenic drugs mainly include biological macromolecular drugs targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and small molecule VEGFR inhibitors. Angiogenesis is known to play a key role in the growth and metastasis of breast cancer. Therefore, anti-angiogenetic therapy has potential in metastatic breast cancer patients. Since the approval of tumor drug indications by NPMA in China is often later than the release of the latest research data, the National Health Commission issued \"the guiding principles for the clinical application of new antitumor drugs\" in 2020. The principle pointed out that under special circumstances such as the absence of better treatment, medical institutions should manage the usage of drugs that are not clearly defined in the instructions but have evidence-based data. Based on the latest research progress in breast cancer, the consensus writing expert group collated published reports, international academic conferences, conducted analysis, discussion and summary, collected data on the use of small molecule anti-vascular targeting drugs for advanced breast cancer, and formulated \"expert consensus on the application of small molecule anti-angiogenic drugs in the treatment of advanced breast cancer\" . For clinicians' reference only.",
  "The growing volume of health data provides new opportunities for medical research. By using existing registries, large populations can be studied over a long period of time. Patient-level linkage of registries leads to even more detailed and extended information per patient, but brings challenges regarding responsibilities, privacy and security, and quality of data linkage. In this paper we describe how we dealt with these challenges when creating the Primary Secondary Cancer Care Registry (PSCCR)- Breast Cancer.The PSCCR - Breast Cancer was created by linking two existing registries containing data on 1) diagnosis, tumour and treatment characteristics of all Dutch breast cancer patients (NCR), and 2) consultations and diagnoses from primary care electronic health records of about 10% of Dutch GP practices (Nivel-PCD). The existing registry governance structures and privacy regulations were incorporated in those of the new registry. Privacy and security risks were reassessed. Data were restricted to females and linked using postal code and date of birth. The breast cancer diagnosis was verified in both registries and for a subsample of 44 patients with the GP as well.A collaboration agreement was signed in which the organisations retained data responsibility and accountability for 'their' registry. A Trusted Third Party performed the record linkage. Ten percent of the patients with breast cancer could be linked to the primary care registry, as was expected based on the coverage of Nivel-PCD, and finally 7 % could be included. The breast cancer diagnosis was verified by the GP in 42 of the 44 patients.We developed and validated a procedure for patient-level linkage of health data registries without a unique identifier, while preserving the integrity and privacy of the original registries. The method described may help researchers wishing to link existing health data registries.",
  "Breast cancer is the most common cancer among females worldwide with rising incidence. In the United States, screening mammography and advances in therapy have lowered mortality by 41% since 1990. Screening mammography is supported by randomized control trials (RCT), observational studies, and computer model data. Digital breast tomosynthesis is a new technology that addresses limitations in mammography resulting from overlapping breast tissue, improving its sensitivity and specificity. Patients at high risk for breast cancer include those with a \u226520% lifetime risk, high-risk germline mutation, or history of thoracic radiation treatment between 10-30 years of age. Such patients are recommended to undergo annual screening mammography and adjunctive annual screening breast MRI. Patients unable to undergo MRI may undergo whole breast ultrasound or contrast-enhanced mammography. Pregnant and lactating patients at average risk for breast cancer are recommended to undergo age-appropriate screening mammography.",
  "Cholesterol is a risk factor for breast cancer. However, it is still unclear whether the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway plays any significant role in breast carcinogenesis. 24-Dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24) is a key enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis pathway. Although DHCR24 is reported to have different functions in different cancers, it is not clear whether DHCR24 is involved in breast cancer. In this study, we found that DHCR24 expression was higher in breast cancer especially in luminal and HER2 positive breast cancer tissues compared with normal breast. Changes in DHCR24 expression altered cellular cholesterol content without affecting the adherent growth of breast cancer cells. However, DHCR24 knockdown reduced whereas DHCR24 overexpression enhanced breast cancer stem-like cell populations such as mammosphere and aldehyde dehydrogenase positive cell numbers. In addition, DHCR24 overexpression increased the expression of the Hedgehog pathway-regulated genes. Treating DHCR24 overexpressing breast cancer cell lines with the Hedgehog pathway inhibitor GANT61 blocked DHCR24-induced mammosphere growth and increased mRNA levels of the Hedgehog regulated genes. Furthermore, expression of a constitutively activated mutant of Smoothened, a key hedgehog signal transducer, rescued the decreases in mammosphere growth and Hedgehog regulated gene expression induced by knockdown of DHCR24. These results indicate that DHCR24 promotes the growth of breast cancer stem-like cells in part through enhancing the Hedgehog signaling pathway. Our data suggest that cholesterol contribute to breast carcinogenesis by enhancing Hedgehog signaling and cancer stem-like cell populations. Enzymes including DHCR24 involved in cholesterol biosynthesis should be considered as potential treatment targets for breast cancer.",
  "Numerous studies have suggested that metformin treatment can increase breast cancer survival; however, it is unclear whether its effects interact with intrinsic subtype or diabetic status. Therefore, we conducted a large nationwide study to assess this in women with surgically resected invasive breast cancer.Patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer between 2007 and 2016 were identified using the national health insurance claims database of South Korea. Metformin or other drug exposures was defined as medication for\u2009\u2265\u200990\u00a0days. Breast cancer subtypes were classified into four groups based on hormonal therapy and anti-HER2 treatments.A total of 117,333 patients were included (median follow-up duration, 90\u00a0months). Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) affected significantly overall survival (OS, 7\u00a0years, 89.7% vs. 92.4%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). A significant interaction was found between the use of metformin and insulin in patients with T2DM (p\u2009=\u20090.018). Thus, the subsequent analysis was limited to these patients and propensity score matching was performed. We found significantly increased OS in patients treated with metformin (7-year OS, 88.3% vs. 85.6%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Interestingly, a significant effect was observed in the hormonal therapy (HT)+/HER2-targeted therapy (Tx)- group (p\u2009<\u20090.001), whereas no specific association was observed in the HT-/HER2 Tx- group (p\u2009=\u20090.220).Metformin administration may be associated with reduced mortality in patients with surgically resected breast cancer, particularly in the HT+/HER2 Tx- group. Clinical trials investigating metformin as a combination agent in breast cancer should stratify patients by curative resection, intrinsic subtype, the presence of T2DM, and the use of insulin.",
  "Breast cancer is uncommon in men and knowledge about its causation limited. Obesity is a risk factor but there has been no investigation of whether weight change is an independent risk factor, as it is in women. In a national case-control study, 1998 men with breast cancer incident in England and Wales during 2005 to 2017 and 1597 male controls were interviewed about risk factors for breast cancer including anthropometric factors at several ages. Relative risks of breast cancer in relation to changes in body mass index (BMI) and waist/height ratios at these ages were obtained by logistic regression modelling. There were significant trends of increasing breast cancer risk with increase in BMI from age 20 to 40 (odds ratio [OR] 1.11 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.17] per 2\u00a0kg/m<sup>2</sup> increase in BMI; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and from age 40 to 60 (OR 1.12 [1.04-1.20]; P\u00a0=\u00a0.003), and with increase in self-reported adiposity compared to peers at age 11 to BMI compared with peers at age 20 (OR 1.19 [1.09-1.30]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Increase in waist/height ratio from age 20 to 5\u2009years before diagnosis was also highly significantly associated with risk (OR 1.13 [1.08-1.19]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). The associations with increases in BMI and waist/height ratio were significant independently of each other and of BMI or waist/height ratio at the start of the period of change analysed, and effects were similar for invasive and in situ tumours separately. Increases in BMI and abdominal obesity are each risk factors for breast cancer in men, independently of obesity per se. These associations might relate to increasing oestrogen levels with weight gain, but this needs investigation.",
  "Fertility and pregnancy-related issues are major concerns for young breast cancer patients. Limited data are available on physicians' knowledge, attitudes and practice in these fields.A 26-item questionnaire exploring 3 different topics (fertility preservation, pregnancy after breast cancer and breast cancer during pregnancy) was sent by email to physicians attending the 2016 3rd European School of Oncology (ESO) - European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Breast Cancer in Young Women Conference (BCY3) and the 15th St. Gallen International Breast Cancer Conference 2017 (BCC 2017). Given the selected sample, survey respondents were expected to have a higher than average interest in the management of breast cancer patients. Descriptive analyses were performed.A total of 273 physicians (105\u202fat BCY3 and 168\u202fat BCC 2017) completed the survey; 37.0%, 46.9% and 34.8% reported never having consulted the available international guidelines on fertility preservation, pregnancy after breast cancer and management of breast cancer during pregnancy, respectively. Up to 18.3% of respondents did not know if the different fertility preservation options were available in their country; 22.3% suggested that controlled ovarian stimulation should not be considered safe in patients with hormone receptor-positive disease. A total of 30.4% of respondents agreed or were neutral on the statement that pregnancy in breast cancer survivors may increase the risk of recurrence. Regarding breast cancer during pregnancy, 23.8% and 38.1% disagreed or were neutral on the statements that endocrine therapy and anti-HER2 agents should be avoided during pregnancy, respectively.Further educational initiatives are needed to improve physicians' knowledge and adherence to available guidelines when addressing fertility and pregnancy-related issues in young breast cancer patients.",
  "The potential advantages of oncoplastic breast conserving surgery (BCS) have not been validated in robust studies that constitute high levels of evidence, despite oncoplastic techniques being widely adopted around the globe. There is hence the need to define the precise role of oncoplastic BCS in the treatment of early breast cancer, with consensual recommendations for clinical practice.A panel of world-renowned breast specialists was convened to evaluate evidence, express personal viewpoints and establish recommendations for the use of oncoplastic BCS as primary treatment of unifocal early stage breast cancers using the GRADE approach.According to the results of the systematic review of literature, the panelists were asked to comment on the recommendation for use of oncoplastic BCS for treatment of operable breast cancer that is suitable for breast conserving surgery, with the GRADE approach. Based on the voting outcome, the following recommendation emerged as a consensus statement: Oncoplastic breast conserving surgery should be recommended versus standard breast conserving surgery for the treatment of operable breast cancer in adult women who are suitable candidates for breast conserving surgery (with very low certainty of evidence).This review has revealed a low level of evidence for most of the important outcomes in oncoplastic surgery with lack of any randomized data and absence of standard tools for evaluation of clinical outcomes and especially patients' values. Despite areas of controversy, about one-third (36%) of panel members expressed a strong recommendation in support of oncoplastic BCS. Presumably, this reflects a synthesis of views on the relative complexity of these techniques, associated complications, impact on quality of life and costs.",
  "Asian women with breast cancer are often studied in aggregate, belying significant intragroup diversity. The authors sought to examine differences in breast cancer characteristics and outcomes among Asian women.Asian, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic White women aged 18 years and older who were diagnosed with breast cancer from 1990 to 2016 were identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 18 database. Asian patients were subclassified as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Filipino, Vietnamese, South Asian (Asian Indian or Pakistani), Southeast Asian (SEA, i.e., Cambodian, Laotian, Hmong, or Thai), or other Asian. Unadjusted overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted OS and CSS.In total, 910,415 women were included (Asian, n = 63,405; Black, n = 92,226; Hispanic, n = 84,451; White, n = 670,333). Asian women had higher rates of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive disease compared with White women (18.7% vs 13.8%) and had the highest 10-year unadjusted OS and CSS among all racial/ethnic groups (all P < .001). SEA women had the highest rates of stage IV disease at presentation, whereas Japanese women had the lowest rates (5.9% vs 2.7%; P < .001). Japanese women had the highest 10-year unadjusted CSS (89.4%; 95% confidence interval, 88.7%-90.1%) of any distinct Asian group, whereas SEA women had the worst unadjusted CSS (78%; 95% confidence interval, 74.1%-81.3%; P < .001). After adjustment, SEA women had the worst OS of any Asian group and were the only Asian group without improved OS compared with White women (reference category; P = .08).Breast cancer characteristics and outcomes vary significantly among Asian women. Future research should consider disaggregation by country or region of origin to identify subgroups that are at risk for worse outcomes than aggregated data may suggest.Asian women with breast cancer are frequently studied as a single entity. However, Asian ethnic groups differ greatly by country of origin, genetic ancestry, disease frequency, socioeconomic status, patterns of immigration, as well as dietary and cultural practices. Women of different Asian ethnicities vary significantly with regard to cancer characteristics, such as mortality and tumor subtype. Future research should disaggregate these populations to better understand, treat, and counsel Asian patients with breast cancer.",
  "This study was aimed at examining the risks of subsequent primary cancers (SPCs) among breast cancer survivors by hormone receptor (HR) status and age at diagnosis.Data from 12 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries were used to identify 431,222 breast cancer survivors (at least 1 year) diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 84 years from 1992 to 2015. Risks of SPCs were measured as the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and the excess absolute risk (EAR) per 10,000 person-years. Poisson regression was used to test the difference in SIRs by HR status.In comparison with the general population, the risk of new cancer diagnoses among survivors was 20% higher for those with HR-positive cancers (SIR, 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19-1.21; EAR, 23.3/10,000 person-years) and 44% higher for those with HR-negative cancers (SIR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.41-1.47; EAR, 45.2/10,000 person-years), with the risk difference between HR statuses statistically significant. The higher risk after HR-negative cancer was driven by acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and breast, ovarian, peritoneal, and lung cancers. By age at diagnosis, the total EAR per 10,000 person-years ranged from 15.8 (95% CI, 14.1-17.5; SIR, 1.11) among late-onset (age, 50-84 years) HR-positive survivors to 69.4 (95% CI, 65.1-73.7; SIR, 2.24) among early-onset (age, 20-49 years) HR-negative survivors, with subsequent breast cancer representing 73% to 80% of the total EAR. After breast cancer, the greatest EARs were for ovarian cancer among early-onset HR-negative survivors, lung cancer among early- and late-onset HR-negative survivors, and uterine corpus cancer among late-onset HR-positive survivors.Risks of SPCs after breast cancer differ substantially by subtype and age. This suggests that more targeted approaches for cancer prevention and early-detection strategies are needed in survivorship care planning.",
  "By the time they complete breast cancer therapy, many young patients are still of childbearing age. We aim to estimate the incidence of pregnancies in women who completed treatment and examine the percentage of patients who received fertility counseling before initiation of therapy.Electronic health records of breast cancer patients between 2008 and 2014\u00a0at AUBMC were screened for exclusion criteria of having metastatic disease or known infertility, still receiving therapy, and being above 42\u00a0years\u00a0at diagnosis. Data about therapy and tumor characteristics was obtained for the included survivors who were interviewed as well via telephone for information about fertility preservation counseling, pregnancy occurrence, and delivery.451 breast cancer patients were identified. 39 patients remained after application of exclusion criteria. 30.76% (n\u00a0=\u00a012) wanted more children at the time of diagnosis. 10.25% (n\u00a0=\u00a04) of all 39 patients treated for breast cancer achieved one or more pregnancy after a median time of 3.83 years after completion of therapy. 25% (n\u00a0=\u00a03) of women who wanted more children at diagnosis (n\u00a0=\u00a012) were able to conceive. 23.07% (n\u00a0=\u00a09) of patients discussed fertility with their primary oncologist prior to treatment initiation. 35.89% (n\u00a0=\u00a014) of patients were aware of fertility preservation technique availability, but none of these patients used one.The observed rate of pregnancy is comparable to the literature. There is a lack in fertility counseling of breast cancer patients, and the rate of use of fertility preservation techniques is very low despite prior knowledge about their availability.",
  "Multigene panel tests for breast cancer predisposition routinely include ATM as it is now a well-established breast cancer predisposition gene.We included ATM in a multigene panel test applied to the Australian Breast Cancer Family Registry (ABCFR), a population-based case-control-family study of breast cancer, with the purpose of estimating the prevalence and penetrance of heterozygous ATM pathogenic variants from the family data, using segregation analysis.The estimated breast cancer hazard ratio for carriers of pathogenic ATM variants in the ABCFR was 1.32 (95% confidence interval 0.45-3.87; P\u2009=\u20090.6). The estimated cumulative risk of breast cancer to age 80\u00a0years for heterozygous\u00a0ATM pathogenic variant carriers was estimated to be 13% (95% CI 4.6-30).Although ATM has been definitively identified as a breast cancer predisposition gene, further evidence, such as variant-specific penetrance estimates, are needed to inform risk management strategies for carriers of pathogenic variants to increase the clinical utility of population testing of this gene.",
  "Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) has been associated with an increased cancer incidence and poorer prognosis. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of vitamin D receptor (VDR) and vitamin D binding protein (GC gene) may interfere with vitamin D activity. This study assesses the role of VDR and GC SNPs on breast cancer (BC) recurrence and survival in a cohort of patients with a family history of breast cancer, without the pathogenic variant for BRCA1 and BRCA2. A consecutive series of patients who underwent genetic testing were genotyped for VDR and GC genes. Specifically, ApaI, FokI, TaqI, BsmI and rs2282679, rs4588, rs7041 SNPs were determined. A total of 368 wild type (WT) patients with BC were analyzed for VDR and GC SNPs. The GC rs2282679 minor allele was significantly associated with luminal subtype of the primary tumor compared to Her2+/TN breast cancer (<i>p</i> = 0.007). Multivariate Cox models showed that BmsI and TaqI are significantly associated with BC outcome. Patients with the major alleles showed more than 30% lower hazard of relapse (BsmI <i>p</i> = 0.02 and TaqI <i>p</i> = 0.03). Our study supports the evidence for a pivotal role of 25OHD metabolism in BC. GC SNPs may influence the hormone tumor responsiveness and VDR may affect tumor prognosis.",
  "Breast cancer image fusion consists of registering and visualizing different sets of a patient synchronized torso and radiological images into a 3D model. Breast spatial interpretation and visualization by the treating physician can be augmented with a patient-specific digital breast model that integrates radiological images. But the absence of a ground truth for a good correlation between surface and radiological information has impaired the development of potential clinical applications. A new image acquisition protocol was designed to acquire breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and 3D surface scan data with surface markers on the patient's breasts and torso. A patient-specific digital breast model integrating the real breast torso and the tumor location was created and validated with a MRI/3D surface scan fusion algorithm in 16 breast cancer patients. This protocol was used to quantify breast shape differences between different modalities, and to measure the target registration error of several variants of the MRI/3D scan fusion algorithm. The fusion of single breasts without the biomechanical model of pose transformation had acceptable registration errors and accurate tumor locations. The performance of the fusion algorithm was not affected by breast volume. Further research and virtual clinical interfaces could lead to fast integration of this fusion technology into clinical practice.",
  "Our study aimed to explore temporal trends and survival benefit of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) in male breast cancer (MBC).Men with stage I-III unilateral breast cancer between 1998 and 2016 were identified from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER). We compared CPM rate over the study period using the Cochrane-Armitage test for trend. Logistic regression model was used to test for factors predicting CPM. Survival analysis was conducted in patients who underwent CPM or unilateral mastectomy (UM) with a first diagnosis of unilateral breast cancer. Kaplan-Meier curve and univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to compare overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) between CPM and UM groups. Propensity score matching was adopted to balance baseline characteristics.5118 MBC cases were included in the present study, with 4.1% (n\u2009=\u2009209) patients underwent CPM. The proportion of men undergoing CPM increased from 1.7 in 1998 to 6.3% in 2016 (P\u2009<\u20090.0001). Young age, recent years of diagnosis, higher tumor grade and lower T stage were significantly associated with CPM. A cohort of 3566 patients were enrolled in survival analysis with a median follow-up of 65\u00a0months. CPM was associated with better OS (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37-0.89, P\u2009=\u20090.022) rather than BCSS (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.29-1.11, P\u2009=\u20090.153) compared with UM. In propensity score-matched model, CPM was not an independent prognostic factor for OS (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.46-1.52, P\u2009=\u20090.553) and BCSS (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.39-2.47, P\u2009=\u20090.970).Our study revealed a dramatic increase in CPM utilization among MBC, especially in young patients. However, CPM provides no survival benefit for MBC compared with UM, indicating the decision of CPM should be fully discussed.",
  "The majority of women in Nigeria present with advanced-stage breast cancer. To address the role of geospatial access, we constructed a geographic information-system-based model to evaluate the relationship between modeled travel time, stage at presentation, and overall survival among patients with breast cancer in Nigeria.Consecutive patients were identified from a single-institution, prospective breast cancer database (May 2009-January 2019). Patients were geographically located, and travel time to the hospital was generated using a cost-distance model that utilized open-source data. The relationships between travel time, stage at presentation, and overall survival were evaluated with logistic regression and survival analyses. Models were adjusted for age, level of education, and socioeconomic status.From 635 patients, 609 were successfully geographically located. The median age of the cohort was 49 years (interquartile range [IQR], 40-58 years); 84% presented with \u2265stage III disease. Overall, 46.5% underwent surgery; 70.8% received systemic chemotherapy. The median estimated travel time for the cohort was 45 minutes (IQR, 7.9-79.3 minutes). Patients in the highest travel-time quintile had a 2.8-fold increase in the odds of presenting with stage III or IV disease relative to patients in the lowest travel-time quintile (P = .006). Travel time \u226530 minutes was associated with an increased risk of death (HR, 1.65; P = .004).Geospatial access to a tertiary care facility is independently associated with stage at presentation and overall survival among patients with breast cancer in Nigeria. Addressing disparities in access will be essential to ensure the development of an equitable health policy.",
  "Breast cancer incidence in Northern Thailand has shown a continuous increase since records began in 1983. In 2002 the urgency of the situation prompted Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital to initiate the Suandok Breast Cancer Network (SBCN).The SBCN is a not-for-profit organization in the university hospital which serves as a training and education center and provides highly specialized medical care for patients in Chiang Mai and in 5 provinces of northern Thailand, with the key mission of improving breast cancer care. The short-term goal was to overcome the barriers to engagement with breast cancer and its treatment and the long-term goal was to increase the overall survival rate of breast cancer patients in our region.We enrolled breast cancer patients treated at Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital between January 2006 and December 2015 and divided into 2 cohorts: 1485 patients who were diagnosed from 2006 to 2009 (cohort 1: early implementation of SBCN) and 2383 patients who were diagnosed from 2010 to 2015 (cohort 2: full implementation of SBCN). Criteria to measure improved cancer waiting time (CWT) would include: time to diagnosis, time to surgery, and time to radiotherapy. The 5-year overall survival (OS) of the cohort 2 was higher than that in cohort 1, at 73.8 (72.0-75.5) compared to 71.5 (69.2-73.7) (p-value\u2009=\u20090.03).Reasons behind the success of project include the uniformity of care encouragement, service network development and timely access to each step of breast cancer management. The model used in SBCN could be adopted as a learning guide to improve healthcare access and outcome for breast cancer patients in low- to middle-income countries.",
  "Breast cancer survival is increasing, making late effects such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) more relevant. The purpose of this study was to evaluate incident CVD following breast cancer diagnosis among long-term survivors and to investigate possible risk factors for CVD.A population-based cohort of 6641 breast cancer survivors diagnosed between 1997 and 2009 who survived at least 10\u00a0years was identified within the Utah Cancer Registry. In addition, 36,612 cancer-free women from the general population, matched by birth year and state, were identified within the Utah Population Database. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate CVD hazard ratios (HRs) for >10 to 15 and >15\u00a0years.Long-term breast cancer survivors had an increased risk of newly diagnosed diseases of the circulatory system (HR, 1.32; 99% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-1.75) from 10 to 15\u00a0years following cancer diagnosis compared with the general population. No increased CVD risks were observed after 15\u00a0years. Breast cancer survivors with Charlson Comorbidity Index score \u22652 had a significantly higher risk of diseases of the circulatory system (HR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.08-6.45) beyond 10\u00a0years following breast cancer diagnosis. Similarly, older age, obesity, lower education, and family history of CVD and breast cancer were risk factors for heart and circulatory system diseases among long-term breast cancer survivors.Risk of CVD compared to the general population was moderate among this cohort of long-term breast cancer survivors between 10 to 15\u00a0years since cancer diagnosis. Awareness of CVD risks is important for breast cancer survivors.",
  "It was reported that eribulin regulates the tumor microenvironment, including the immune system, by inducing vascular remodeling. Lymphocyte counts are a critical index of immune response in patients. The non-Asian, global EMBRACE study has suggested that baseline absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) may be a predictor of the survival benefit of eribulin in breast cancer patients. We examined whether the baseline ALC is a potential predictor of overall survival (OS) in Japanese patients with HER2-negative advanced breast cancer treated with eribulin.This was a post hoc analysis of data from a post-marketing observational study of eribulin in Japan. The OS by baseline ALC was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, with the cut-off value of 1500/\u03bcL for ALC. The OS by baseline neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a general prognostic index in breast cancer patients, was also estimated, with the cut-off value of 3.The median OS was longer in patients with an ALC of\u2009\u2265\u20091500/\u03bcL than in those with an ALC of\u2009<\u20091500/\u03bcL (19.4 vs. 14.3\u00a0months; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.628; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.492, 0.801). Patients with an NLR of\u2009\u2265\u20093 showed shorter OS than those with an NLR of\u2009<\u20093 (13.2 vs. 18.8\u00a0months; HR: 1.552; 95% CI 1.254, 1.921), and NLR also separated OS in patients with an ALC of\u2009<\u20091500/\u03bcL.Consistent with the findings of a previous study involving a non-Asian, Western population, our study suggested that baseline ALC may be a predictive factor for the survival benefit of eribulin in Japanese patients.",
  "This study aimed to determine the incidence of male breast cancer (MBC) and its survival outcomes in Korea, and to compare these results to those for female breast cancer (FBC).We searched the Korea Central Cancer Registry and identified 227,122 breast cancer cases that were diagnosed between 1999 and 2016. Demographic and clinical characteristics and overall survival (OS) rates were estimated according to sex, age, histological type, and cancer stage.The 227,122 patients included 1,094 MBC cases and 226,028 FBC cases. Based on the age-standardized rate, the male: female ratio was 0.0055:1. The most common ages at diagnosis were 60-69 years for MBC and 40-49 years for FBC (p < 0.001). Male patients were less likely than female patients to receive adjuvant radiotherapy (7.5% vs. 21.8%, p < 0.001) or adjuvant chemotherapy (40.1% vs. 55.4%, p < 0.001). The 5-year OS rates after diagnosis were 88.8% for all patients, although it was significantly lower for MBC than for FBC (76.2% vs. 88.9%, p < 0.001). In both groups, older age (\u2265 60 years) was associated with shorter survival. The 5-year OS rates for the invasive histological types were 75.8% for men and 89.0% for women. The 5-year OS rates in both groups decreased with increasing cancer stage.MBC was diagnosed at older ages than FBC, and male patients were less likely to receive radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The survival outcomes were worse for MBC than for FBC, with even poorer outcomes related to older age, the inflammatory histological types, and advanced stage. It is important that clinicians recognize the differences between FBC and MBC when treating these patients.",
  "Breast cancer is the second most prevalent cancer in women worldwide. Long non\u2011coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified as important regulators of tumorigenesis and tumor metastasis. lncRNA FGD5\u2011AS1 has been previously reported as a carcinogenic gene, however its role in breast cancer has yet to be investigated. The present study aimed to understand the function of lncRNA FGD5\u2011AS1 in breast cancer and examine the underlying molecular mechanisms. Sample tissues for downstream gene expression profiling were collected from patients with breast cancer (n=23). The effect of FGD5\u2011AS1 overexpression on cell viability, invasion and migration has been studied in breast cancer cells (MDA\u2011MB\u2011231). Changes in glycolysis were monitored by comparing glucose consumption, lactate production and ATP levels. Using StarBase and TargetScan databases a putative interaction between FGD5\u2011AS1, miR\u2011195\u20115p and SNF1\u2011like kinase\u00a02 (NUAK2) was predicted <i>in\u00a0silico</i>. Expression levels of FGD5\u2011AS1, has\u2011miR\u2011195\u20115p and NUAK2 were validated by reverse transcription\u2011quantitative PCR and interactions were validated using dual\u2011luciferase reporter assays and RNA pull\u2011down. High expression of lncRNA FGD5\u2011AS1 was detected in breast cancer tissue samples and disease model cell lines. Silencing of FGD5\u2011AS1 led to decreased cell proliferation, migration and invasion. It was identified that at a molecular level FGD5\u2011AS1 serves as a sponge of miR\u2011195\u20115p and alters the expression of its downstream target gene NUAK2. In breast cancer lncRNA FGD5\u2011AS1 serve a key role in glycolysis and tumor progression via the miR\u2011195\u20115p/NUAK2 axis. The findings of the present study indicated FGD5\u2011AS1 as a candidate target for intervention in patients with breast cancer.",
  "New insights into tumor-associated metabolic reprogramming have provided novel vulnerabilities that can be targeted for cancer therapy. Here, we propose a mass spectrometry imaging (MSI)-based metabolomic strategy to visualize the spatially resolved reprogramming of carnitine metabolism in heterogeneous breast cancer. <b>Methods:</b> A wide carnitine coverage MSI method was developed to investigate the spatial alternations of carnitines in cancer tissues of xenograft mouse models and human samples. Spatial expression of key metabolic enzymes that are closely associated with the altered carnitines was examined in adjacent cancer tissue sections. <b>Results:</b> A total of 17 carnitines, including L-carnitine, 6 short-chain acylcarnitines, 3 middle-chain acylcarnitines, and 7 long-chain acylcarnitines were imaged. L-carnitine and short-chain acylcarnitines are significantly reprogrammed in breast cancer. A classification model based on the carnitine profiles of 170 cancer samples and 128 normal samples enables an accurate identification of breast cancer. CPT 1A, CPT 2, and CRAT, which are extensively involved in carnitine system-mediated fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation pathway were also found to be abnormally expressed in breast cancer. Remarkably, the expressions of CPT 2 and CRAT were found for the first time to be altered in breast cancer. <b>Conclusion:</b> These data not only expand our understanding of the complex tumor metabolic reprogramming, but also provide the first evidence that carnitine metabolism is reprogrammed at both the metabolite and enzyme levels in breast cancer.",
  "We evaluated the incidence of breast cancer and overall survival in a multi-center cohort of ovarian cancer patients carrying BRCA1/2 mutations in order to assess risks and formulate optimal preventive interventions and/or surveillance.Medical records of 502 BRCA1/2 mutation carriers diagnosed with ovarian cancer between 2000 and 2018 at 7 medical centers in Israel and one in New York were retrospectively analyzed for breast cancer diagnosis. Data included demographics, type of BRCA mutations, surveillance methods, timing of breast cancer diagnosis, and family history of cancer.The median age at diagnosis of ovarian cancer was 55.8 years (range, 23.9-90.1). A third (31.5%) had a family history of breast cancer and 17.1% of ovarian cancer. Most patients (67.3%) were Ashkenazi Jews, 72.9% were BRCA1 carriers. Breast cancer preceded ovarian cancer in 17.5% and was diagnosed after ovarian cancer in 6.2%; an additional 2.2% had a synchronous presentation. Median time to breast cancer diagnosis after ovarian cancer was 46.0 months (range, 11-168). Of those diagnosed with both breast cancer and ovarian cancer (n = 31), 83.9% and 16.1% harbored BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, respectively. No deaths from breast cancer were recorded. Overall survival did not differ statistically between patients with an ovarian cancer diagnosis only and those diagnosed with breast cancer after ovarian cancer.The low incidence of breast cancer after ovarian cancer in women carrying BRCA1/2 mutations suggests that routine breast surveillance, rather than risk-reducing surgical interventions, may be sufficient in ovarian cancer survivors.",
  "Personalised prevention of breast cancer has focused on women at very high risk, yet most breast cancers occur in women at average, or moderately increased risk (\u2264moderate risk).To determine; 1) interest of women at\u202f\u2264\u202fmoderate risk (consumers) in personalised information about breast cancer risk; 2) familial cancer clinicians' (FCCs) perspective on managing women at\u202f\u2264\u202fmoderate risk, and; 3) both consumers' and FCCs reactions to iPrevent, a personalised breast cancer risk assessment and risk management decision support tool.Seven focus groups on breast cancer risk were conducted with 49 participants; 27 consumers and 22 FCCs. Data were analysed thematically.Consumers reported some misconceptions, low trust in primary care practitioners for breast cancer prevention advice and frustration that they often lacked tailored advice about breast cancer risk. They expressed interest in receiving personalised risk information using iPrevent. FCCs reported an inadequate workforce to advise women at\u202f\u2264\u202fmoderate risk and reacted positively to the potential of iPrevent to assist.While highlighting a potential role for iPrevent, several outstanding issues remain. For personalised prevention of breast cancer to extend beyond women at high risk, we must harness women's interest in receiving tailored information about breast cancer prevention and identify a workforce willing to advise women.",
  "Breast cancer remains a worldwide public health issue. LncRNA and autophagy respectively or simultaneously, get involved in cellular and molecular processes of many different cancers, including genesis, metastasis, and deterioration of breast cancer and other malignant tumors. In this review, relevant studies have been summarized, and we have found that lncRNA-mediated autophagy in luminal A breast cancer, luminal B breast cancer, HER-2 positive breast cancer, and basal-like breast cancer may play an important role in mediating drug resistance sensitivity. LncRNAs target genes and affect different signaling pathways to a complex network, which attenuates the occurrence and development of primary breast cancer by coordinating autophagy. Abnormal expression of LncRNA may lead to dysregulation of autophagy, resulting in tumor genesis, expansion, and resistance to anti-tumor therapy. Targeting specific lncRNAs for autophagy regulation may conduct as a bio-marker for reliable diagnosis and prognosis treatment of breast cancer or provide a promising therapeutic strategy.",
  "Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequent cancer in women and the leading cause of cancer death in females worldwide. Rapid research advancements add to the complexity of treatment options for this disease. It is known that the quality of patients' care is deeply affected by healthcare professionals following these advancements. There is a growing need for academic education to increase clinical knowledge and skills of physicians treating BC patients. The certificate of Competence in Breast Cancer Program (CCB) is a Certificate in Advanced Studies (CAS) organized by the European School of Oncology in cooperation with Ulm University (Germany), which focuses on both the clinical and scientific competence required for improving quality in the management of BC patients. This paper describes the experience of the second CCB cohort (CCB2), which brought together 24 physicians from four continents who shared the common will to improve their competence and skills in BC treatment.",
  "Diet may be a modifiable factor in the prevention of breast cancer (BC) by modulating inflammation. We used a food-based empirical dietary inflammatory index (FDII) to evaluate the association between FDII and odds of breast cancer in Iranian women.The present case-control study carried out on 150 age-matched women with newly diagnosed breast cancer and controls. Data for dietary intake and anthropometric measures were collected. FDII score was developed according to participants dietary intakes of 27 pre-defined food groups. Multivariate odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to investigate the association of empirically derived food-based inflammatory potential of the diet and breast cancer.The odds ratios of BC according to quartiles of FDII score by multivariate logistic regression models indicated the FDII score was significantly associated with BC risk (OR: 2.38; 95% CI: 1.23-4.59, P<sub>trend</sub>\u00a0=\u00a0.04). After controlling confounders, multivariate logistic regressions remained significant which revealed in participants at the fourth quartile of FDII score chance of breast cancer was 2.8 times higher than participants in the first quartile.The results of our study suggested that more pro-inflammatory diet (higher FDII scores) was associated with increased BC risk. These findings suggest that developing an effective dietary modification based on FDII may reduce risk of BC.",
  "This investigation aimed to study breast cancer awareness based on health information literacy and influential factors of breast cancer awareness among female nursing students in Changchun city in China. A four-part self-report questionnaire including the participants' general demographic characteristics, the participants' specialized characteristics concerning breast cancer screening, the Chinese version of the Breast Cancer Awareness Measurement (C-BCAM), and the Chinese version of the Health Information Literacy Self-rating Scale (HILSS) was designed to investigate breast cancer awareness and health information literacy and influential factors of breast cancer awareness among 205 female nursing students in Year 1-Year 3 using convenience sampling. The data were analyzed with SPSS 26.0 using descriptive statistics, nonparametric tests, and multiple regression analysis. The nursing students had an average level of HIL (median\u2009=\u2009101.00, (93.00, 107.00)) and a good level of breast cancer awareness (median\u2009=\u200982.00, (76.00, 88.00)). A significant positive correlation was found between the HILSS and total C-BCAM score (r\u2009=\u20090.439, P\u2009<\u20090.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that grades (P\u2009<\u20090.001), training in BSE (P\u2009=\u20090.025), and intention of undergoing breast cancer screening (P\u2009=\u20090.028) were three predictive factors for breast cancer awareness among female nursing students. The female nursing students' HIL was at an average level, and breast cancer awareness was at a good level. Health information literacy and breast cancer awareness among female nursing students in Changchun were significantly positively correlation, as demonstrated by this survey. Therefore, nursing education has the responsibility to improve female nursing students' awareness of breast cancer at different grades and to cultivate health information literacy. More training in BSE is needed. Greater efforts may be needed to develop targeted nursing education to strengthen female nursing students' awareness of breast cancer and HIL.",
  "Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide and the leading cause of death among Iraqi women. Breast cancer cases in Iraq were found to have increased from 26.6/100,000 in 2000 to 31.5/100,000 in 2009. The present study aims to assess the established risk factors of breast cancer among Iraqi women and to highlight strategies that can aid in reducing the incidence.1093 Iraqi females were enrolled in this cross-sectional study by purposive sampling methods. Data collection occurred from July 2019 to September 2019. 1500 women participated in the study, and 407 women were ultimately excluded. The questionnaire was conducted as a self-administrated form in an online survey. Ethical approval was obtained from the College of Medicine in the University of Baghdad. The Gail Model risk was calculated for each woman by the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT), an interactive model developed by Mitchell Gail that was designed to estimate a woman's absolute risk of developing breast cancer in the upcoming five years of her life and in her lifetime.The ages of the participants ranged from 35 to 84\u00a0years old. The mean 5-year risk of breast cancer was found to be 1.3, with 75.3% of women at low risk and 24.7% of women at high risk. The mean lifetime risk of breast cancer was found to be 13.4, with 64.7% of women at low risk, 30.3% at moderate risk, and 5.0% at high risk. The results show that geographically Baghdad presented the highest 5-year risk, followed by Dhi Qar, Maysan, and Nineveh. However, the highest lifetime risk was found in Najaf, followed by Dhi Qar, Baghdad, and Nineveh, successively.Breast cancer is a wide-spreading problem in the world and particularly in Iraq, with Gail Model estimations of high risk in several governorates. Prevention programs need to be implemented and awareness campaigns organized in order to highlight the importance of early detection and treatment.",
  "Recent studies revealed that metabolic stress influences the outcomes of breast cancer treatment. We sought to evaluate the prognostic effect of type 2 diabetes and find the molecular mechanism of relapses in postoperative HER-2+ breast cancer patients treated with HER-2 targeted therapy.We evaluated 190 HER-2+ breast cancer patients (pT1-4N0-2M0) who were treated with surgical resection and trastuzumab (HER-2 targeted therapy) between 2006 and 2015. Survival outcomes and failure patterns were compared between such patients with (n\u2009=\u200912) and without (n\u2009=\u2009178) type 2 diabetes.The median follow-up period was 42.4\u00a0months (range 12.0-124.7\u00a0months). Twenty-one patients (11.1%) showed relapse (including nine patients with locoregional failure), and three patients (1.6%) died as a result of cancer relapse. One-third of the patients with diabetes experienced relapse (4/12, 33.3%). The 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 90.7% and 98.6%, respectively. Diabetic patients showed shorter DFS compared with non-diabetic patients (p\u2009=\u20090.006, 74.1% vs. 91.9%). OS was also shorter in diabetic patients compared with non-diabetic patients (p\u2009=\u20090.017, 91.7% vs. 99.1%). Of our interest, the levels of HER-3 and its ligand neuregulin-1 were significantly increased in the tumor specimen in HER-2+ breast cancer patients suffering with type 2 diabetes than that in the euglycemic control group.Type 2 diabetes was associated with detrimental effects on survival in postoperative HER-2+ breast cancer patients who were treated with trastuzumab. The poor prognostic effect of diabetes in HER-2+ breast cancer patients could be associated with the high levels of HER-3 and neuregulin 1, thus it should be considered and evaluated more.",
  "Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor among women in the world. In 2005, there were approximately 272,000 new cases diagnosed and more than 70,000 deaths from breast cancer in China. Of the patients who are newly diagnosed with breast cancer each year, approximately 3% to 10% have distant metastases at the time of diagnosis. Of those who have early stage disease at diagnosis, from 30% to 40% will develop advanced breast cancer. The 5-year survival rate for patients with advanced breast cancer is only 20%, and the median overall survival (OS) is 2 to 3 years. Although advanced breast cancer is still difficult to cure, physicians can relieve clinical symptoms, improve quality of life, and further prolong survival through the development of new drugs and the optimization model of treatment. Patients with advanced breast cancer have their own preferences in the choice of treatment options. Moreover, there is no standard recommendation for the treatment of refractory breast cancer after multiline therapy. To offer a reference for clinicians, a Chinese expert group has analyzed, summarized, and discussed related research data on the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of inoperable, locally advanced breast cancer and recurrent or metastatic breast cancer and has developed the Chinese expert consensus on the clinical diagnosis and treatment of advanced breast carcinoma (2018).",
  "Preclinical research suggests that the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in breast cancer can be enhanced by combining them with antiangiogenics, particularly in a sequential fashion. We sought to explore the efficacy and biomarkers of combining the anti-PD-L1 durvalumab plus the antiangiogenic bevacizumab after bevacizumab monotherapy for advanced HER2-negative breast cancer.Patients had advanced HER2-negative disease that progressed while receiving single-agent bevacizumab maintenance as a part of a previous chemotherapy plus bevacizumab regimen. Treatment consisted of bi-weekly durvalumab plus bevacizumab (10\u2009mg/kg each i.v.). Peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained before the first durvalumab dose and every 4\u2009weeks and immunophenotyped by flow-cytometry. A fresh pre-durvalumab tumor biopsy was obtained; gene-expression studies and immunohistochemical staining to assess vascular normalization and characterize the immune infiltrate were conducted. Patients were classified as \"non-progressors\" if they had clinical benefit (SD/PR/CR) at 4\u2009months. The co-primary endpoints were the changes in the percentage T cell subpopulations in PBMCs in progressors versus non-progressors, and PFS/OS time.Twenty-six patients were accrued. Median PFS and OS were 3.5 and 11\u2009months; a trend for a longer OS was detected for the hormone-positive subset (19.8 versus 7.4\u2009months in triple-negatives; P\u2009=\u20090.11). Clinical benefit rate at 2 and 4\u2009months was 60% and 44%, respectively, without significant differences between hormone-positive and triple-negative (P\u2009=\u20090.73). Non-progressors' tumors displayed vascular normalization features as a result of previous bevacizumab, compared with generally abnormal patterns observed in progressors. Non-progressors also showed increased T-effector and T-memory signatures and decreased T<sub>REG</sub> signatures in gene expression studies in baseline-post-bevacizumab-tumors compared with progressors. Notably, analysis of PBMC populations before durvalumab treatment was concordant with the findings in tumor samples and showed a decreased percentage of circulating T<sub>REGs</sub> in non-progressors.This study reporting on sequential bevacizumab+durvalumab in breast cancer showed encouraging activity in a heavily pre-treated cohort. The correlative studies agree with the preclinical rationale supporting an immunopriming effect exerted by antiangiogenic treatment, probably by reducing T<sub>REGs</sub> cells both systemically and in tumor tissue. The magnitude of this benefit should be addressed in a randomized setting.(www.clinicaltrials.gov): NCT02802098 . Registered on June 16, 2020.",
  "This is the first systematic review to investigate the risk of recurrence in breast cancer survivors <50 years old who have used hormone replacement therapy (HRT).The risk of HRT in premenopausal breast cancer survivors is unclear. Due to the higher incidence of estrogen receptor negative tumours in women <50, the potential for HRT to promote breast cancer recurrence may differ from older age groups.We performed a search of Medline, EMBASE and CINAHL through June 2016. For the observational studies relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for the recurrence rate among HRT users and nonusers. A random effects model was used to estimate the combined RR using the Mantel-Haenszel method.Four papers satisfied our inclusion criteria. 3477 subjects were analyzed. On pooled meta-analysis of breast cancer recurrence in the observational studies, no significant association was found between HRT and risk of recurrence (RR 1.04 [95% CI 0.45, 2.41]). The randomized controlled trial (RCT) included found an increased risk of recurrence with HRT among women <50 (HR 1.56 [95% CI 1.1-2.2]). However, among women of all ages with an estrogen receptor negative tumour there was no significant difference in recurrence when compared to hormone receptor positive tumours (HR 1.15 [95% CI 0.7-1.8, p\u202f=\u202f0.55]).This review on HRT in breast cancer survivors <50 revealed conflicting results between randomized and observational study data. Further studies are warranted to investigate the association between HRT and recurrence rates in younger breast cancer survivors.",
  "Breast cancer death rates are higher than any other cancer in American women. Machine learning-based predictive models promise earlier detection techniques for breast cancer diagnosis. However, making an evaluation for models that efficiently diagnose cancer is still challenging. In this work, we proposed data exploratory techniques (DET) and developed four different predictive models to improve breast cancer diagnostic accuracy. Prior to models, four-layered essential DET, e.g., feature distribution, correlation, elimination, and hyperparameter optimization, were deep-dived to identify the robust feature classification into malignant and benign classes. These proposed techniques and classifiers were implemented on the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) and Breast Cancer Coimbra Dataset (BCCD) datasets. Standard performance metrics, including confusion matrices and K-fold cross-validation techniques, were applied to assess each classifier's efficiency and training time. The models' diagnostic capability improved with our DET, i.e., polynomial SVM gained 99.3%, LR with 98.06%, KNN acquired 97.35%, and EC achieved 97.61% accuracy with the WDBC dataset. We also compared our significant results with previous studies in terms of accuracy. The implementation procedure and findings can guide physicians to adopt an effective model for a practical understanding and prognosis of breast cancer tumors.",
  "Trends in breast cancer mortality in the United States are decreasing, but racial disparities persist. Using an implementation science framework to inform evidence-based breast cancer screening and navigation within federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) with community stakeholders can mitigate barriers to screening.Using an integrated theoretical framework of the Practical, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model and the Social Ecological Model, the University of Illinois Cancer Center and Mile Square Health Centers (MSHC) FQHC developed a breast cancer screening and navigation program, known as the Mile Square Accessible Mammogram Outreach and Engagement (Mi-MAMO) program, to tackle breast cancer disparities in Chicago among underresourced communities. To increase access to screening, patient navigators conducted community outreach activities. Partnerships were forged with community-based organizations, health care systems, and insurers. Outcomes were monitored with standardized performance measures.Between January and December 2017, 103 women received a screening mammogram at MSHC. To increase screening rates, Mi-MAMO was started in August 2017. Between January and December 2018, the number of women who received a screening mammogram increased to 567. From August 2017 to December 2018, 779 women received navigation to screening and/or diagnostic services through the Mi-MAMO program. The majority of women were uninsured (63.9%), and 95.5% were racial/ethnic minorities. Twenty-four percent (n\u00a0=\u00a0185) completed diagnostic services, and 10 women received positive breast cancer diagnoses (mean age, 49.7\u00a0years); all successfully navigated to treatment. The Mi-MAMO program is ongoing.Deploying an integrated framework for patient navigation programs can increase breast cancer screening utilization and awareness among underresourced populations at higher risk for breast cancer.",
  "<b>OBJECTIVE.</b> The purpose of this study was to compare breast cancer characteristics and treatment regimens among women undergoing annual versus nonannual screening mammography. <b>MATERIALS AND METHODS.</b> In this retrospective, institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant cohort study, a breast cancer database was queried for patients who received a mammographic or clinical diagnosis of breast cancer during 2016-2017. Annual versus biennial and annual versus nonannual (biennial and triennial) mammography screening cohorts were compared using <i>t</i> tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous variables and chi-square or Fisher exact tests for categoric variables. <b>RESULTS.</b> A total of 490 patients were diagnosed with breast cancer during 2016-2017. Among these women, 245 had an assignable screening frequency and were 40-84 years old (mean, 61.8 \u00b1 9.9 [SD] years; median, 62 years). Screening frequency was annual for 200 of these 245 patients (81.6%), biennial for 32 (13.1%), and triennial for 13 (5.3%). Annual screening resulted in fewer late-stage presentations (AJCC stage II, III, or IV in 48 of 200 patients undergoing annual [24.0%] vs 14 of 32 undergoing biennial [43.8%; <i>p</i> = .02] and vs 20 of 45 undergoing nonannual screening [44.4%; <i>p</i> = .006]), fewer interval cancers (21 of 200 for annual [10.5%] vs 12 of 32 for biennial [37.5%; <i>p</i> < .001] and vs 15 of 45 for nonannual [33.3%; <i>p</i> < .001]), and smaller mean tumor diameter (1.4 \u00b1 1.2 cm for annual vs 1.8 \u00b1 1.6 cm for biennial [<i>p</i> = .04] and vs 1.8 \u00b1 1.5 cm nonannual [<i>p</i> = .03]). Lower AJCC stage, fewer interval cancers, and smaller tumor diameter also persisted among postmenopausal women undergoing annual screening. Patients undergoing biennial and nonannual screening showed nonsignificant greater use of axillary lymph node dissection (annual, 24 of 200 [12.0%]; biennial, 6 of 32 [18.8%]; nonannual, 7 of 45 [15.6%]) and chemotherapy (annual, 55 of 200 [27.5%]; biennial, 12 of 32 [37.5%]; nonannual, 16 of 45 [35.6%]). <b>CONCLUSION.</b> Annual mammographic screening was associated with lower breast cancer stage and fewer interval cancers than biennial or nonannual screening.",
  "The association of circulating lipids with breast cancer is being debated. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between abnormal plasma lipids and breast cancer risk in Bangladeshi women.This was a case-control study designed using a population of 150 women (50 women in each group). The lipid levels of women with breast cancer were compared to the lipid levels of women with benign breast disease (control group 1) and healthy women (control group 2). Study samples were collected from the Department of Surgery, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, for a period of 1\u2009year. Ethical measures were in compliance with the current Declaration of Helsinki. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS version 26.All of the comparison groups shared similar sociodemographic, anthropometric and obstetric characteristics. The incidence of dyslipidemia was significantly higher in breast cancer patients (96%) than in healthy women (84%) and patients with benign breast disease (82%) (P\u2009<\u20090.05 for both). The levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol among the breast cancer patient group were significantly higher than those among both benign breast disease patients and healthy women (P\u2009<\u20090.05), except for high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Adjusting for other factors, body mass index (BMI) (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) (>\u200923) [OR 53.65; 95% CI: 5.70-504.73; P\u2009<\u20090.001] and total cholesterol (mg/dl) (\u2265 200) [OR 16.05; 95% CI: 3.13-82.29; P\u2009<\u20090.001] were independently associated with breast cancer.Total cholesterol and BMI are independent predictors of breast cancer risk among Bangladeshi women.",
  "Although the genetic and hormonal risk factors of breast cancer are well identified, they cannot fully explain the occurrence of all cases. Epidemiological and experimental studies have suggested that exposure to environmental pollutants, especially those with potential estrogenic properties, as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) may have a role in breast cancer development. Being the most abundantly detected in human tissues and in the environment, congener 153 (PCB153) is widely used in epidemiological studies as indicator for total PCBs exposure.We aimed to estimate the association between cumulative atmospheric exposure to PCB153 and breast cancer risk.We conducted a case-control study of 5222 cases and 5222 matched controls nested within the French E3N cohort from 1990 to 2011. Annual atmospheric PCB153 concentrations were simulated with the deterministic chemistry-transport model (CHIMERE) and were assigned to women using their geocoded residential history. Their cumulative PCB153 exposure was calculated for each woman from their cohort inclusion to their index date. Breast cancer odds ratios (ORs) associated with cumulative PCB153 exposure and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated using multivariate conditional logistic regression models.Overall, our results showed a statistically significant linear increase in breast cancer risk related to cumulative atmospheric exposure to PCB153 as a continuous variable (adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a01.19; 95% CI: 1.08-1.31, for an increment of one standard deviation among controls (55\u00a0pg/m<sup>3</sup>)). Among women who became postmenopausal during follow-up, the association remained statistically significant (adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a01.23; 95% CI: 1.09-1.39). In analyses by hormone receptors status, the positive association remained significant only for ER-positive breast cancer (adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a01.18; 95% CI: 1.05-1.33).This study is the first to have estimated the impact of atmospheric exposure to PCB153 on breast cancer risk. Our results showed a statistically significant increase in breast cancer risk, which may be limited to ER-positive breast cancer. These results warrant confirmation in further independent studies but raise the possibility that exposure to PCB153 increase breast cancer risk.",
  "About 70% of breast cancers overexpress estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1, encoded by ESR1). Tamoxifen, a competitive inhibitor of estrogen that binds to ER, has been widely used as a treatment for ER-positive breast cancer. However, 20-30% of breast cancer is resistant to tamoxifen treatment. The mechanisms underlying tamoxifen resistance remain elusive. We found that Yes-associated protein (YAP; also known as YAP1), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF; also known as CCN2) and cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (Cyr61; also known as CCN1) are overexpressed, while ER\u03b1 is downregulated in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer. Inhibition of YAP, CTGF and Cyr61 restored ER\u03b1 expression and increased sensitivity to tamoxifen. Overexpression of YAP, CTGF, and Cyr61 led to downregulation of ER\u03b1 and conferred resistance to tamoxifen in ER-positive breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, CTGF and Cyr61 downregulated ER\u03b1 expression at the transcriptional level by directly binding to the regulatory regions of the ER\u03b1-encoding gene, leading to increased tamoxifen resistance. Also, CTGF induced Glut3 (also known as SLC2A3) expression, leading to increased glycolysis, which enhanced cell proliferation and migration in tamoxifen-resistant cells. Together, these results demonstrate a novel role of YAP, CTGF and Cyr61 in tamoxifen resistance and provide a molecular basis for their function in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer.",
  "Pathologic response at the time of surgery after neoadjuvant therapy for HER2 positive early breast cancer impacts both prognosis and subsequent adjuvant therapy. Comprehensive descriptions of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer is not well described. We utilized standard stromal pathologist-assessed tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) quantification, quantitative multiplex immunofluorescence, and RNA-based gene pathway signatures to assess pretreatment TME characteristics associated pathologic complete response in patients with hormone receptor positive, HER2 positive early breast cancer treated in the neoadjuvant setting.We utilized standard stromal pathologist-assessed TIL quantification, quantitative multiplex immunofluorescence, and RNA-based gene pathway signatures to assess pretreatment TME characteristics associated pathologic complete response in 28 patients with hormone receptor positive, HER2 positive early breast cancer treated in the neoadjuvant setting.Pathologist-assessed stromal TILs were significantly associated with pathologic complete response (pCR). By quantitative multiplex immunofluorescence, univariate analysis revealed significant increases in CD3+, CD3+CD8-FOXP3-, CD8+ and FOXP3+ T-cell densities as well as increased immune cell aggregates in pCR patients. In subsets of paired pre/post-treatment samples, we observed significant changes in gene expression signatures in non-pCR patients and significant decreases in CD8+ densities after treatment in pCR patients. No RNA based pathway signature was associated with pCR.TME characterization HER2 positive breast cancer patients revealed several stromal T-cell densities and immune cell aggregates associated with pCR. These results demonstrate the feasibility of these novel methods in TME evaluation and contribute to ongoing investigations of the TME in HER2+ early breast cancer to identify robust biomarkers to best identify patients eligible for systemic de-escalation strategies.",
  "Mammography is the standard examination for breast cancer screening of woman aged\u2009\u2265\u200940\u00a0years. High breast density on mammography indicates that mammary gland parenchyma occupy a high percentage of the breast. The objective of this study was to investigate factors associated with breast density and the risk of high breast density for breast cancer.A multicenter case-control study was performed in 530 patients and 1043 controls. Breast density was classified as C1-C4 using the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS). Clinical factors were obtained from questionnaires or medical records, and the influence of each factor (breast density, menopausal status, body mass index (BMI), parity, presence or absence of breastfeeding history, age at menarche, age at first birth, and familial history of breast cancer) on breast cancer risk in all patients was calculated as an age-adjusted odds ratio (OR). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were then performed in all patients and in pre- and postmenopausal and BMI-stratified groups using factors with a significant age-adjusted OR as adjustment factors.Age-adjusted ORs for breast cancer were significant for breast density, BMI, parity, and breast feeding, but not for age at menarche, age at first birth, or family history of breast cancer. In multivariate analysis, there was a significant correlation between breast density and breast cancer in postmenopausal women (OR for C1 vs. C2 1.90 [95% CI 1.34-2.70]; C1 vs. C4 2.85 [95% CI 1.10-7.16]). This correlation was also significant in patients in the third BMI quartile (22.3-24.5\u00a0kg/m<sup>2</sup>) (OR for C1 vs. C4 8.76 [95% CI 2.38-42.47]); and fourth BMI quartile (>24.5\u00a0kg/m<sup>2</sup>) (OR for C1 vs. C2 1.92 [95% CI 1.17-3.15]; C1 vs. C4 11.89 [95% CI 1.56-245.17]).Breast density on mammography is a risk factor for breast cancer after adjustment for other risk factors. This risk is particularly high in postmenopausal women and those with a high BMI.",
  "Comprehensively analyzing the prevalence of BRCA1/2 germline pathogenic variants (PVs) in a large cohort of unselected Chinese patients with breast cancer has great clinical importance.Germline pathogenic variants in full-length BRCA1/2 genes were determined through next-generation sequencing and/or Sanger sequencing assays in 8627 unselected Chinese patients with breast cancer who were treated at the Breast Center of Peking University Cancer Hospital. The prevalence of BRCA1/2 PVs was further stratified by age at diagnosis, family history of cancer and molecular subtype.We found that the overall prevalence of BRCA1/2 PVs was 6.0% in the entire cohort, 2.4% in BRCA1 and 3.7% in BRCA2. The prevalence of BRCA1/2 PVs in patients with early-onset breast cancer (age at diagnosis\u2009\u2264\u200940\u00a0years) was significantly higher than that in patients over the age of 40 (9.7% vs. 5.1%). The prevalence rates of BRCA1/2 PVs in patients with a family history of breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancer were 19.5%, 39.0%, 11.1%, and 12.8%, respectively. Moreover, the number of relatives affected by breast cancer was associated with a higher prevalence of BRCA1/2 PVs. Molecular subtypes were associated with the prevalence of BRCA1/2 PVs. Patients with the triple-negative phenotype had the highest prevalence of BRCA1/2 PVs (13.3%) among the three molecular groups, followed by the HR\u2009+\u2009and HER2- group (5.9%), and the lowest was in the HER2\u2009+\u2009group (2.5%).Our study provides the most comprehensive information to date on the prevalence of BRCA1/2 PVs in unselected Chinese patients with breast cancer.",
  "The association between body mass index (BMI) and the incidence of premenopausal breast cancer in the Asian population remains unclear. We investigated this association using data from a Japanese nationwide administrative database.We retrospectively identified 785,703 females aged\u2009<\u200945\u00a0years with available health checkup data on BMI from January 2005 and April 2020 from a Japanese nationwide database. Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate hazard ratios for breast cancer (total breast cancer, breast cancer with hormonal drug and trastuzumab administration, and breast cancer by age\u2009\u2264\u200945\u00a0years) associated with BMI recorded at the first health checkup. We conducted restricted cubic spline analysis without BMI categorization to investigate potential nonlinear associations with adjustment for backgrounds such as smoking and alcohol consumption.Overall, the median BMI was 20.5 (interquartile range [IQR], 18.9-22.7) kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and the median age was 37 (IQR, 29-41) years. Breast cancer occurred in 5597 participants (0.71%) at a median age of 44 (IQR, 42-46) years during a median follow-up of 1034 (IQR, 634-1779) days. A BMI of\u2009\u2265\u200922.0\u00a0kg/m<sup>2</sup> was significantly associated with lower incidences of total breast cancer, breast cancer with hormonal drug administration, and breast cancer by age\u2009\u2264\u200945\u00a0years, whereas no significant associations were observed for breast cancer with trastuzumab administration.This study, which used a Japanese nationwide database, demonstrated that BMI was inversely associated with premenopausal breast cancer development in Japanese women, similar to that observed in Western women.",
  "Whether breast-conserving therapy (BCT) should be chosen as a local treatment for young women with early-stage breast cancer is controversial. This study compared the survival benefits of BCT or mastectomy in young women under 40 with early-stage breast cancer and further explored age-stratified outcomes. This study investigated whether there is a survival benefit when young women undergo BCT compared with mastectomy.The characteristics and prognosis of white women under 40 with stage I-II breast cancer from 1988 to 2016 were analyzed using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. These women were either treated with BCT or mastectomy. The log-rank test of the Kaplan-Meier survival curve and Cox proportional risk regression model were used to analyze the data and survival. The analysis was stratified by age (18-35 and 36-40\u200ayears).A total of 23,810 breast cancer patients were included, of whom 44.9% received BCT and 55.1% underwent mastectomy, with a median follow-up of 116\u200amonths. Patients undergoing mastectomy had a higher tumor burden and younger age. By the end of the 20th century, the proportion of BCT had grown from nearly 35% to approximately 60%, and then gradually fell to 35% into the 21st century. Compared with the mastectomy group, the BCT group had improved breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) (hazard ratio [HR] 0.917; 95% CI, 0.846-0.995, P\u200a=\u200a.037) and overall survival (OS) (HR 0.925; 95% CI, 0.859-0.997, P\u200a=\u200a.041). In stratified analysis according to the different ages, the survival benefit of BCT was more pronounced in the slightly older (36-40\u200ayears) group while there was no significant survival difference in the younger group (18-35\u200ayears).In young women with early-stage breast cancer, BCT showed survival benefits that were at least no worse than mastectomy, and these benefits were even better in the 36 to 40\u200ayears age group. Young age may not be a contraindication for BCT.",
  "Herein, our purpose was to calculate the 5-year and lifetime risk of breast cancer and to assess new breast cancer potential contributors among Egyptian women utilizing the modified Gail model, while presenting a global comparison of risk assessment.This study included 7009 women from both urban and rural areas scattered across 40% of the Egyptian provinces. The 5-year risk categories were defined as low risk (\u2264\u20091.66%) or high risk (>\u20091.66%), whereas the lifetime risk categories were defined as low risk (\u2264\u200920%) or high risk (>\u200920%). Pearson's Chi-squared test was performed to determine the association between participants' characteristics and distinct risk categories. Binary logistic regression was carried out for correlation analysis.The mean estimated risk for developing invasive breast cancer over 5 years was 0.86 (\u00b1\u20090.67), whereas the mean lifetime breast cancer risk score was 11.26 (\u00b1\u20095.7). Accordingly, only 614 (8.75%) and 470 (6.7%) women were categorized as individuals with high risk of breast cancer incidence in 5-year and lifetime, respectively. Only 192 participants (2.7%) conferred both high 5-year and high lifetime risk scores. Marital status, method of feeding, physical activity behavior, contraceptive use, menopause and number of children were found to have a statistically significant association with both 5-year and lifetime breast cancer risk categories.We revealed that modified Gail model had a well-fitting and discrimination accuracy in Egyptian women when compared with other countries.",
  "approximately 6000 Cameroonian women died of cancer in 2018, and the breast is the most affected with 2625 new cases. The aim of this study was to establish a pattern of malignant breast tumours in Yaound\u00e9 (Cameroon).this study was a descriptive and analytical retrospective study of breast cancer between January 2010 and December 2015 in Yaound\u00e9 General Hospital (YGH) after the Institutional ethics committee approval. The variables studied were the socio-demographic characteristics, risk factors for breast cancer, types of tumours and type of treatments. The 5-year survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. The adjusted hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated to assess the association between studied variables and patient survival through the cox regression using SPSS 23 software. The difference was considered significant at p < 0.05.among the 344 files collected in this study, breast cancer patients were predominantly female (96.64%, n = 288) aged 45.39 \u00b1 13.35 years, with invasive ductal carcinoma (68.03%, n = 270), located in the left breast (52%, n= 147). The average tumour size was ~6.5 \u00b1 0.3 cm and diagnosed in grade II of Scarf Bloom Richardson (SBR) in 60% (n= 150) of cases. The 5-year survival was 43.3%. Factors associated with this poor survival were the religion (aHR 5.05, 95% CI: 1.57 - 16.25; p = 0.007 for animist and aHR 4.2, 95% CI: 1.53 - 11.46; p = 0.005 for protestant), location of the tumour (aHR 6.24, 95% CI: 1.58 - 24.60; p = 0.012), tumor height (aHR 0.21, 95% CI: 0.04 - 1.11; p = 0.011) and the time spent before medical treatment (aHR 5.12, 95% CI: 0.39 - 8.38; p = 0.011).the young age, large tumour size and high histological grade in our studied population suggest a weak awareness of women about breast cancer. Action should be taken in early screening to improve the management of breast cancer in Cameroon.",
  "Women harboring mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes are at increased lifetime risk of developing breast cancer and are faced with decisions about risk management, including whether to undergo high-risk screening or risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM). National guidelines recommend BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers consider RRM, but that carriers of moderate penetrance mutations (e.g., ATM or CHEK2) should be managed based on family history. We aimed to investigate determinants of decision for RRM, and hypothesized that mutation status, age, family history, partner status, and breast cancer would impact RRM decision making.We performed a retrospective study assessing RRM decisions for 279 women.Women with BRCA and moderate penetrance gene mutations, a personal history of breast cancer, or a first degree relative with a history of breast cancer were more likely to undergo RRM. Breast cancer status and age showed an interaction effect such that women with breast cancer were less likely to undergo RRM with increasing age.Although national guidelines do not recommend RRM for moderate penetrance carriers, the rates of RRM for this population approached those for BRCA mutation carriers. Further insights are needed to better support RRM decision-making in this population.",
  "Women at increased familial breast cancer risk have been offered screening starting at an earlier age and increased frequency than national Screening Programmes for over 30\u00a0years. There are limited data on longer-term largescale implementation of this approach on cancer diagnosis.Women at our institution at\u2009\u2265\u200917% lifetime breast cancer risk have been offered enhanced screening with annual mammography starting at age 35 or 5-years younger than youngest affected relative, with upper age limit 50 for moderate and 60 for high-risk. Breast cancer pathology, stage and receptor status were assessed as well as survival from cancer diagnosis by Kaplan-Meier analysis.Overall 14,311 women were seen and assessed for breast cancer risk, with 649 breast cancers occurring in 129,119\u00a0years follow up (post-prevalent annual incidence\u2009=\u20094.55/1000). Of 323/394 invasive breast cancers occurring whilst on enhanced screening, most were lymph-node negative (72.9%), T1 (\u2264\u200920\u00a0mm, 73.2%) and stage-1 (61.4%), 126/394 stage2-4 (32%). 10-year breast cancer specific survival was 91.3% (95% CI 87.4-94.0) better than the 75.9% (95% CI 74.9-77.0) published for England in 2013-2017. As expected, survival was significantly better for women with screen detected cancers (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Ten-year survival was particularly good for those diagnosed\u2009\u2264\u200940 at 93.8% (n\u2009=\u200975; 95% CI 84.2-97.6). Women with lobular breast cancers had worse 10-year survival at 85.9% (95% CI 66.7-94.5). Breast cancer specific survival was good for 119 BRCA1/2 carriers with 20-year survival in BRCA1:91.2% (95% CI 77.8-96.6) and 83.8% (62.6-93.5) for BRCA2.Targeted breast screening in women aged 30-60\u00a0years at increased familial risk is associated with good long-term survival that is substantially better than expected from population data.",
  "Many patients return to cognitively demanding work after breast cancer treatments. This makes treatment-related cognitive decline an important research topic. Psychological resilience, cognitive reserve and better perceived general health may work as protective factors against cognitive decline. The aim of this study was to analyse whether these factors are associated with cognitive function among such women. Data from 384 breast cancer survivors who underwent neuropsychological examination at follow-up 4-9 years after surgery were used. The neurocognitive domain variable Learning and Memory was computed from Wechsler Memory Scale-III subtests Learning and Delayed Recall. Another variable, Attention, Processing speed and Executive function, was computed from semantic and verbal fluency tests, Trail Making Test A and B, and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Test-IV subtest Coding. Psychological resilience was measured with Resilience Scale-14, and perceived general health with RAND-36 subitem General Health. RESULTS: showed that levels of cognitive performance and general health were statistically higher than population average. Resilience and general health in separate models were associated with Attention, Processing speed and Executive function (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.14, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01; \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.13, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03, respectively). When added simultaneously in the same model, resilience was significant (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.13, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04), but general health was not. These associations were nonsignificant after controlling for confounding factors. Learning and Memory was not associated with resilience or general health. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies identifying patients at a high risk of developing cognitive decline after breast cancer treatments and on preventive and therapeutic approaches.",
  "To assess risks of secondary malignancies in breast cancer patients who received radiation therapy compared to patients who did not.The SEER database was used to identify females with a primary diagnosis of breast cancer as their first malignancy, during 1973-2008. We excluded patients with metastatic disease, age <18 years, no definitive surgical intervention, ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence, or who developed a secondary malignancy within 1 year of diagnosis. Standardized incidence ratios and absolute excess risk were calculated using SEER*Stat, version 8.2.1 and SAS, version 9.4.There were 374,993 patients meeting the inclusion criteria, with 154,697 who received radiation therapy. With a median follow-up of 8.9 years, 13% of patients (49,867) developed a secondary malignancy. The rate of secondary malignancies was significantly greater than the endemic rate in breast cancer patients treated without radiation therapy, (O/E 1.2, 95% CI 1.19-1.22) and with radiation therapy (O/E 1.33, 95% CI 1.31-1.35). Approximately 3.4% of secondary malignancies were attributable to radiation therapy. The increased risk of secondary malignancies in breast cancer patients treated with radiation therapy compared to those without was significant regardless of age at breast cancer diagnosis (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and more pronounced with longer latency periods.There was an increased risk of secondary malignancies for breast cancer patients both with and without radiation therapy compared to the general population. There was an increased risk in specific sites for patients treated with radiation therapy. This risk was most evident in young patients and who had longer latency periods.",
  "Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a large family of synthetic chemicals, some of which are mammary toxicants and endocrine disruptors. Recent studies have implicated exposure to PFASs as a risk factor for breast cancer in Europe and America. Little is known about the role of PFASs with respect to breast cancer in the Chinese population.Participants who were initially diagnosed with breast cancer at Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital between 2012 and 2016 were recruited as cases. The controls were randomly selected from the participants with available blood samples in the Chinese National Breast Cancer Screening Program (CNBCSP) cohort. Ultimately, we enrolled 373 breast cancer patients and 657 controls. Plasma PFASs were measured by an ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system coupled to a 5500 Q-Trap triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. A logistic regression model with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regularization was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the relationships between PFASs and breast cancer. The three most predictive variables in the LASSO model were selected from 17 PFASs, which was based on the optimal penalty coefficient (\u03bb\u2009=\u20090.0218) identified with the minimum criterion. Additionally, Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) and quantile g-computation models were applied to evaluate the associations between separate and mixed exposure to PFASs and breast cancer.Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) exhibited the highest concentration in both the cases and controls. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluoro-n-decanoic acid (PFDA) were positively associated with breast cancer, and perfluoro-n-tridecanoic acid (PFTrDA) was negatively associated with breast cancer according to both the continuous-PFASs and the quartile-PFASs logistic regression models. Of note, PFOA was associated with the occurrence of estrogen receptor (ER)-, progesterone receptor (PR)-, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer (OR<sub>ER+</sub> \u2009=\u20091.47, 95% CI: 1.19, 1.80; OR<sub>PR+</sub> \u2009=\u20091.36, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.69; OR<sub>HER2</sub>\u2009=\u20091.62, 95% CI: 1.19, 2.21).Overall, we observed that PFASs were associated with breast cancer in Chinese women. Prospective cohort studies and mechanistic experiments are warranted to elucidate whether these associations are causal.",
  "We conducted this study to investigate the prognosis and failure pattern after breast-conserving treatment (BCT) in patients with occult breast cancer (OBC) with negative breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (MRI-OBC).Survival rates and failure patterns in 66 patients who received axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and BCT for MRI-OBC between 2001 and 2013\u00a0at seven hospitals were analyzed. OBC was defined as adenocarcinoma in the axillary lymph node (ALN)\u00a0+/- supraclavicular (SCN) or internal mammary lymph node (IMN) with a negative breast MRI.Fifty-four patients had only ALN metastasis (ALN only), and 12 patients had ALN metastasis along with SCN or IMN metastasis (ALN\u00a0+\u00a0SCN/IMN). Median follow-up was 82 months. The 5-year overall, disease-free, and breast cancer-free survival rates were 93.4%, 92.1%, and 96.8%, respectively. Nine patients experienced recurrence: breast (n\u00a0=\u00a04), regional lymph nodes (RLN, n\u00a0=\u00a01), distant metastases (DM, n\u00a0=\u00a02), breast/RLN (n\u00a0=\u00a01), and breast/RLN/DM (n\u00a0=\u00a01). Five-year disease-free survival was significantly higher in ALN only patients compared to ALN\u00a0+\u00a0SCN/IMN patients (96.1% vs. 75.0%; p\u202f=\u202f0.02).Patients with MRI-OBC were successfully treated with BCT. There was a small risk of ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence. Failure patterns depended on the extent of initial disease.",
  "Developments in breast cancer biology over the last years have permitted deconstructing the molecular profile of the most relevant breast cancer subtypes. This has led to an increase in therapeutic options, including more effective personalized therapy for breast cancer and substantial improvements in patient outcomes. Although currently there are only a few targeted therapies approved for metastatic breast cancer, the discovery of druggable kinase gene alterations has radically changed cancer treatment by providing novel and successfully actionable drug targets. Fibroblast growth factors and their receptors (FGFRs) participate in different physiologic processes and also play an essential role in cancer cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis. This article summarizes the main molecular alterations of FGFRs, as well as the available preclinical and clinical data with FGFR inhibitors in breast cancer, and discusses new opportunities for the clinical development of these agents in patients with breast cancer.",
  "Hypoxia-Inducible Factor HIF1\u03b1 and lactate dehydrogenase LDHA drive anaerobic tumor metabolism and define clinical aggressiveness. We investigated their expression in breast cancer and their role in immune response and prognosis of breast cancer.Tissue material from 175 breast cancer patients treated in a prospective study were analyzed with immunohistochemistry for HIF1\u03b1 and LDH5 expression, in parallel with the tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte TIL-density and tertiary lymphoid structure TLS-density.High LDH5 expression was noted in 48/175 tumors, and this was related to HIF1\u03b1 overexpression (p\u2009<\u20090.0001), triple-negative TNBC histology (p\u2009=\u20090.01), poor disease-specific survival (p\u2009<\u20090.007), metastasis (p\u2009<\u20090.01), and locoregional recurrence (p\u2009=\u20090.03). High HIF1\u03b1 expression, noted in 39/175 cases, was linked with low steroid receptor expression (p\u2009<\u20090.05), her2 overexpression (p\u2009=\u20090.01), poor survival (p\u2009<\u20090.04), and high metastasis rates (p\u2009<\u20090.004). High TIL-density in the invading tumor front (TILinv) was linked with low LDH5 and HIF expression (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and better prognosis (p\u2009<\u20090.02). High TIL-density in inner tumor areas (TILinn) was significantly linked with TNBC. Multivariate analysis showed that PgR-status (p\u2009=\u20090.003, HR 2.99, 95% CI 1.4-6.0), TILinv (p\u2009=\u20090.02, HR 2.31, 95% CI 1.1-4.8), LDH5 (p\u2009=\u20090.01, HR 2.43, 95% CI 1.2-5.0), N-stage (p\u2009=\u20090.04, HR 2.42, 95% CI 1.0-5.8), T-stage (p\u2009=\u20090.04, HR 2.31, 95% CI 1.0-5.1), and her2 status (p\u2009=\u20090.05, HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.0-4.2) were independent variables defining death events.Overexpression of LDH5, an event directly related to HIF1\u03b1 overexpression, characterizes a third of breast tumors, which is more frequent in TNBC. Both HIF1\u03b1 and LDH5 define cold breast cancer microenvironment and poor prognosis. A rational is provided to study further whether metabolic manipulations targeting HIF and LDH5 may enhance the antitumor immune response in breast cancer.",
  "This study aimed to investigate the predictability of breast MRI for pathologic complete response (pCR) by molecular subtype in patients with breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and investigate the MRI findings that can mimic residual malignancy.A total of 506 patients with breast cancer who underwent MRI after NAC and underwent surgery between January and December 2018 were included. Two breast radiologists dichotomized the post-NAC MRI findings as radiologic complete response (rCR) and no-rCR. The diagnostic performance of MRI predicting pCR was evaluated. pCR was determined based on the final pathology reports. Tumors were divided according to hormone receptor (HR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 2. Residual lesions on post-NAC MRI were divided into overt and subtle which classified as nodularity or delayed enhancement. Pearson's \u03c7<sup>2</sup> and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used for MRI findings causing false-negative pCR.The overall pCR rate was 30.04%. The overall accuracy for predicting pCR using MRI was 76.68%. The accuracy was significantly different by subtypes (p\u2009<\u20090.001), as follows in descending order: HR\u2009-\u2009/HER2\u2009-\u2009(85.63%), HR\u2009+\u2009/HER2\u2009-\u2009(82.84%), HR\u2009+\u2009/HER2\u2009+\u2009(69.37%), and HR\u2009-\u2009/HER2\u2009+\u2009(62.38%). MRI in the HR\u2009-\u2009/HER2\u2009+\u2009type showed the highest false-negative rate (18.81%) for predicting pCR. The subtle residual enhancement observed only in the delayed phase was associated with false-negative findings (76.2%, p\u2009=\u20090.016).The diagnostic accuracy of MRI for predicting pCR differed by molecular subtypes. When the residual enhancement on MRI after NAC is subtle and seen only in the delayed phase, overinterpretation of residual tumors should be performed with caution.\u2022 In patients with breast cancer after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the diagnostic accuracy of MRI for predicting pathologic complete response (pCR) differed according to molecular subtype. \u2022 When residual enhancement on MRI is subtle and seen only in the delayed phase, this finding could be associated with false-negative pCR results.",
  "The incidence of breast cancer has increased dramatically in China. We evaluated the clinical and epidemiologic factors associated with breast cancer, and its stage in a case-control study of Northeast Chinese women. We also examined whether these factors were differentially distributed among molecular subtypes of breast cancer in a case-only analysis. We identified 1118 breast cancer patients and 2284 healthy women from Cancer Hospital of Medical University between January 2014 and December 2017. Logistic regression models were used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We found that postmenopausal women had a decreased risk of breast cancer (multivariate-adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a00.33, 95% CI:0.25-0.43), and tended to have breast cancer of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-overexpressing (multivariate-adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a02.99, 95% CI: 1.49-5.97) and triple-negative (multivariate-adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a02.16, 95% CI: 1.02-4.56) subtypes, compared with the luminal B subtype. Women with history of abortion had an increased risk of breast cancer (multivariate-adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a04.70, 95% CI: 3.60-6.14). Women with high breast density and high Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BIRADS) scores of lesions tended to have breast cancer of advanced stage, but were not differentially distributed among its molecular subtypes. In conclusion, postmenopausal women had decreased risk of breast cancer, and tended to have nonluminal subtype, while women with history of abortion had increased risk of breast cancer. Women with high breast density and BIRADS scores of lesions tended to have advanced stage breast cancer. We provide evidence on the epidemiologic factors for breast cancer and its subtypes, which may help with breast cancer risk stratification.",
  "To identify the practice patterns related to use of surveillance mammography in male breast cancer (MaBC) survivors.Using administrative claims data from OptumLabs Data Warehouse, we identified men who underwent surgery for breast cancer during 2007-2017. We calculated the proportion of men who had at least one mammogram (a) within 13\u00a0months for all patients and (b) within 24\u00a0months amongst those who maintained their insurance coverage for at least that length of time after surgery. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to identify factors associated with mammography within each timeframe.Out of 729 total MaBC survivors, 209 (29%) underwent mammography within 13\u00a0months after surgery. Among those who had lumpectomy, 41% underwent mammography, whereas among those who had mastectomy, 27% had mammography. Amongst 526 men who maintained consistent insurance coverage for 24\u00a0months after surgery, 215 (41%) underwent mammography at least once during that 24-month period. In this cohort, the proportion who had at least one mammogram during the 24-month period was 49% after lumpectomy and 40% after mastectomy. In a multivariate logistic regression model, more recent diagnosis (2015+) and older age at diagnosis were associated with lower odds of undergoing mammography, while receipt of radiation was associated with higher odds of undergoing mammography.Although recent ASCO guidelines recommend surveillance mammography after lumpectomy, a minority of MaBC survivors undergo surveillance mammography, even after lumpectomy. This is likely due to the paucity of data regarding the true benefits and harms of surveillance/screening mammography for MaBC.",
  "Previous research has reported associations between social relationships and carcinogenesis. Inflammation is a potential mediator of these associations. To clarify these links for one tumor site, we examined associations between social relationships, circulating inflammation markers, and breast cancer incidence.Among 132,262 participants from the prospective Women's Health Initiative, we used linear and logistic regression to evaluate associations between social relationship characteristics (social support, social strain, social network size) and inflammation markers of C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count (WBC). Cox regression was used to evaluate associations between inflammation markers and breast cancer incidence, as well as associations between social relationship characteristics and breast cancer incidence with and without adjustment for inflammation markers.Larger social networks were associated with lower continuous CRP (beta\u202f=\u202f-0.22, 95% CI -0.36,\u00a0-0.08) and WBC (beta\u202f=\u202f-0.23, 95% CI -0.31,\u00a0-0.16). Greater social strain was associated with higher continuous CRP (beta\u202f=\u202f0.24, 95% CI 0.14, 0.33) and WBC (beta\u202f=\u202f0.09, 95% CI 0.04, 0.14). When WBC was dichotomized at 10,000\u202fcells/uL, high WBC was associated with greater hazards of in situ breast cancer (HR\u202f=\u202f1.65, 95% CI 1.17, 2.33) but not invasive breast cancer. Social relationship characteristics were not associated with incidence of invasive or in situ breast cancer.Larger social networks were associated with lower inflammation and greater social strain was associated with higher inflammation. Higher inflammation might be associated with development of in situ breast cancer, but this appeared to be due to factors other than social relationships.",
  "In breast cancer, immunohistochemistry (IHC) subtypes, together with grade and stage, are well-known independent predictors of breast cancer death. Given the immense changes in breast cancer treatment and survival over time, we used recent population-based data to test the combined influence of IHC subtypes, grade and stage on breast cancer death.We identified 24,137 women with invasive breast cancer aged 20 to 74 between 2005 and 2015 in the database of the Cancer Registry of Norway. Kaplan-Meier curves, mortality rates and adjusted hazard ratios for breast cancer death were estimated by IHC subtypes, grade, tumour size and nodal status during 13\u2009years of follow-up.Within all IHC subtypes, grade, tumour size and nodal status were independent predictors of breast cancer death. When combining all prognostic factors, the risk of death was 20- to 40-fold higher in the worst groups compared to the group with the smallest size, low grade and ER+PR+HER2- status. Among node-negative ER+HER2- tumours, larger size conferred a significantly increased breast cancer mortality. ER+PR-HER2- tumours of high grade and advanced stage showed particularly high breast cancer mortality similar to TNBC. When examining early versus late mortality, grade, size and nodal status explained most of the late (>\u20095\u2009years) mortality among ER+ subtypes.There is a wide range of risks of dying from breast cancer, also across small breast tumours of low/intermediate grade, and among node-negative tumours. Thus, even with modern breast cancer treatment, stage, grade and molecular subtype (reflected by IHC subtypes) matter for prognosis.",
  "Copper is involved in different hallmarks of cancer, including metastasis, but responsible copper-binding proteins and pathways are not clear. The copper chaperone ATOX1 was recently shown to play a role in breast cancer cell migration, which is a key step in metastasis. Since most cancer-related deaths are due to metastasis, we hypothesized that ATOX1 mRNA expression may be associated with breast cancer disease progression and thus, a prognostic biomarker in breast cancer. We therefore studied the association of ATOX1 expression levels with clinicopathological parameters and survival for 1904 breast cancer patients using the METABRIC data set. Our results indicate ATOX1 expression levels as a potential prognostic biomarker for ER-positive subtypes and early stages of breast cancer. Pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are desired to identify the molecular roles of ATOX1 in these conditions.",
  "Adding taxane to an anthracycline-based regimen improves survival in node-positive breast cancer patients, as shown by clinical trials and meta-analyses. However, no studies have analyzed the number of metastatic lymph nodes in patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive cancer. This study investigated whether adding a taxane to an anthracycline-based regimen improved prognosis in node-positive, ER-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer patients in a real-world setting.Using Japanese Breast Cancer Society registry data, we compared disease-free survival (DFS) of patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, excluding those receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy, between those who received an anthracycline-based regimen followed by a taxane-based regimen (A\u2009+\u2009T) and those who received only an anthracycline-based regimen (A w/o T), stratified by lymph node status. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate DFS in both groups.There were 4566 eligible patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. During the median follow-up period of 60\u00a0months, there were 481 recurrences and 149 deaths. There was no significant difference in DFS between the A\u2009+\u2009T and A w/o T groups among patients with 1-3 positive nodes, while there was a significant difference among patients with\u2009\u2265\u20094 positive nodes.In patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, adding taxane to an anthracycline regimen did not improve DFS in patients with metastasis in 1-3 lymph nodes. We considered that the group without the addition of taxane might be present in patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative lymph node metastases.",
  "At present, little is known about the genetic background of breast cancer (BC) in Kyrgyz. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess gene-to-gene interactions and the contribution of p.Arg72Pro (TP53 gene), p.Gln399Arg (XRCC1 gene), p.Arg194Trp (XRCC1 gene), g.4682G\u2009>\u2009A (TNF\u03b1 gene), p.Val353Ala (HMMR gene), c.14\u2009+\u2009309\u00a0T\u2009>\u2009G (MDM2 gene) and g.38444\u00a0T\u2009>\u2009G (PALB2 gene) polymorphic loci in breast cancer (BC) risk in females of Kyrgyz ethnicity.The case-control study comprised 103 females with histologically verified BC and 102 controls with no cancer. We used polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism to genotype polymorphic loci.Gln/Arg heterozygous variant of XRCC1 gene's p.Gln399Arg locus, as well as combined carriage of Arg/Gln//Arg/Pro of XRCC1/TP53; Arg/Gln//T/T of XRCC1/MDM2; Arg/Gln//G/G and Arg/Gln//G/A of XRCC1/TNF\u03b1, Arg/Gln//T/T of XRCC1/PALB2; Arg/Gln//Arg/Arg and Arg/Gln//Arg/Trp for p.Gln399Arg and p.Arg194Trp polymorphic loci of XRCC1 were associated with BC in Kyrgyz females.TP53, XRCC1, TNF\u03b1, HMMR, MDM2 and PALB2 genes' polymorphic site combinations appear to be candidate markers of genetic predisposition to BC in Kyrgyz population and prompt targeted personalized care.",
  "The quantitative relationship between HER2 copy number and prognosis in HER2 positive adjuvant setting remain controversial, and few studies have focused on adjuvant setting to illustrate the potential clinical relevance of HER2 in cfDNA. Our study aim to develop a novel method in HER2 quantification and explore the relationship between HER2 copy number in primary tumors or cfDNA and prognosis in HER2 positive early breast cancer.Two hundred and two patients with early breast cancer were prospectively included in a study where primary tumors, matching non-cancer breast tissue, corresponding plasma, and the plasma from 20 healthy volunteers were collected. Cox proportional hazard analysis was employed to determine the prognostic value of HER2 gene copy number in tissue and cfDNA. Tissue based nomograms and time-dependent decision curve analysis were used to evaluate the practicality of HER2 copy number stratification.HER2 amplification by CNVplex demonstrated a robust concordance with FISH (concordance 89.2%). A three-tiered system of tissue and a two-tiered system of cfDNA classification were shown to be independent prognostic factors. A tissue copy number-based nomogram was fitted and further evaluation revealed a good performance in discrimination (c statistic 0.801) and calibration.We first report CNVplex as a viable alternative for HER2 detection. Quantitative evaluation of HER2 presents tremendous potential for use in risk stratification. We also uncover the potential for using HER2 copy number in cfDNA as a biomarker for prognosis in a HER2 positive adjuvant setting.",
  "Most research addressing needs and concerns of young patients with breast cancer (\u226440 years) is retrospective. The HOHO European protocol is a prospective multicenter cohort study of young women with newly diagnosed breast cancer, about fertility, psychosocial and quality of life concerns. Here we report the baseline data and focus on predictors of fertility concerns.Patient surveys and medical record review were used. The baseline survey included sociodemographic, medical and treatment data as well as questions on fertility concerns and preservation strategies. Subscales from the CAncer Rehabilitation Evaluation System-Short Form (CARES-SF) were administered to measure specific quality of life aspects. Uni- and multivariable modeling were used to investigate predictors of greater fertility concern.Among 297 eligible respondents, 67% discussed fertility issues before starting therapy, 64% were concerned about becoming infertile after treatment, and 15% decided not to follow prescribed therapies. Fifty-four percent of women wished future children before diagnosis; of these, 71% still desired biologic children afterwards. In multivariable analysis, not having children was the only patient characteristic significantly associated with fertility concerns at diagnosis. Twenty-seven percent used fertility preservation strategies. Women who received chemotherapy reported greater physical (p\u202f=\u202f0.021) and sexual difficulties (p\u202f=\u202f0.039) than women who did not. Women who were married or had a partner reported less psychosocial problems than single women (p\u202f=\u202f0.039).Young women with newly diagnosed breast cancer have several concerns, including, but not limited to, fertility. The HOHO European study provides valuable information to develop targeted interventions.",
  "Breast cancer is the most common cause of death related to cancer in women, and several studies proved that flavonoids could induce apoptosis in this cancer through different pathways. Calycopterin is a flavonoid which was shown to induce preferential antiproliferative effects on some cancers; however, no information is available on its effect on breast cancer. Therefore, in this paper, the apoptotic effect of calycopterin and its underlying mechanism in two different breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cell lines were investigated. MTT assay showed that calycopterin reduced the proliferation of both cancer lines with no adverse effect on normal cells. The clonogenic assay showed that calycopterin treatments decreased the colony numbers and sizes, and wound healing assay demonstrated the inhibition of migration in both cancer cells. Cell cycle and annexin/PI analyses indicated that calycopterin augmented sub-G1 population and annexin/PI-positive cells. Gene expression revealed that Bax/Bcl2 increased in the MDA-MB-231 cell line, while no change was observed in that of the MCF7 line. Expression of gene caspase-8 was augmented in both lines, although increased expression of caspase-3 was found just in MDA-MB-231 cells. Our results validated the apoptotic effect of calycopterin on both breast cancer lines with more potency on triple-negative ones.",
  "Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in women, and although treatment outcome has substantially improved in the past decades, advanced or metastatic breast cancers still carry a poor prognosis. Gene amplification is one of the frequent genetic alterations in cancer, and oncogene amplification may be associated with cancer aggressiveness and oncogenicity. Targeting amplified genes such as HER2 has vastly improved disease outcome and survival, and anti-HER2 therapeutics have revolutionized the standard of care in HER2 breast cancer. Besides currently known druggable gene amplifications including ERBB2 and FGFR2, other frequently amplified genes are relatively less well known for function and clinical significance. By querying four large databases from TCGA and AACR-Genie, from a total of 11,890 patients with invasive ductal breast carcinoma, we discover IKZF3, CCND1, ERBB2 to be consistently amplified across different cohorts. We further identify IKZF3 as a frequently amplified gene in breast cancer with a prevalence of 12-15% amplification rate. Interestingly, IKZF3 amplification is frequently co-amplified with ERBB2/HER2, and is also associated with worse prognosis compared to IKZF3 non-amplified cancers. Analysis of HER2 breast cancer patients treated with trastuzumab revealed decrease in both ERBB2/HER2 and IKZF3 expression. Further investigation using the DepMap for gene dependency by genome-wide CRISPR screening revealed dependence on IKZF3 in HER2 breast cancer cell lines. Our study utilized an integrative analysis of large-scale patient genomics, transcriptomics and clinical data to reveal IKZF3 as a frequently amplified gene, and suggest a potential role of IKZF3 as a druggable target for HER2 breast cancer.",
  "Previous large trials of trastuzumab (TZM) demonstrated improved outcomes in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. However, its effectiveness and safety in Japanese patients is not yet clear. Recently, new anti-HER2 agents were developed to improve treatment outcomes, but the patient selection criteria remain controversial.The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of TZM therapy as perioperative therapy for HER2-positive operable breast cancer in daily clinical practice and to create a recurrence prediction model for therapeutic selection.An observational study was conducted in Japan (UMIN000002737) to observe the prognosis of women (n\u2009=\u20092024) with HER2-positive invasive breast cancer who received TZM for stage I-III C disease between July 2009 and June 2011. Moreover, a recurrence-predicting model was designed to evaluate the risk factors for recurrence.The 5- and 10-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 88.9 (95% CI 87.5-90.3%) and 82.4% (95% CI 79.2-85.6%), respectively. The 5- and 10-year overall survival (OS) rates were 96% (95% CI 95.1-96.9%) and 92.7% (95% CI 91.1-94.3%), respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that the risk factors for recurrence were an age of\u2009\u2265\u200970\u00a0years, T2 or larger tumors, clinically detected lymph node metastasis, histological tumor diameter of\u2009>\u20091\u00a0cm, histologically detected lymph node metastasis (\u2265\u2009n2), and the implementation of preoperative treatment. The 5-year recurrence rate under the standard treatment was estimated to be\u2009>\u200910% in patients with a score of 3 or greater on the recurrence-predicting model.The recurrence-predicting model designed in this study may improve treatment selection of patients with stage I-III C disease. However, further studies are needed to validate the scores generated by this model.",
  "Women who have coexisting comorbidities at the time of breast cancer diagnosis have an increased risk of breast cancer and overall mortality. However, the associations between newly diagnosed comorbidities and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality among these patients have not been examined.The authors compared the associations between coexisting and newly diagnosed CVD, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension and the risk of CVD mortality among patients with breast cancer identified in the Missouri Cancer Registry. In total, 33,099 women who had incident invasive breast cancer with inpatient and outpatient hospital discharge data within 2 years after breast cancer diagnosis were included: 9.3% were Black. Subdistribution hazard ratios (sdHRs) and 95% CIs were calculated for the risk of CVD-related mortality using adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models, accounting for a competing risk of breast cancer deaths.Within the first 2 years after breast cancer, the most reported newly diagnosed comorbidity was hypertension (9%), followed by CVD (4%), and type 2 diabetes (2%). CVD mortality was increased in women who had newly diagnosed CVD (sdHR, 2.49; 95% CI, 2.09-2.99), diabetes (sdHR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.68-2.77), or hypertension (sdHR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.71-2.48) compared with women who did not have these conditions. Associations were similar by race. The strongest association was among women who received chemotherapy and then developed CVD (sdHR, 3.82; 95% CI, 2.69-5.43).Monitoring for diabetes, hypertension, and CVD from the time of breast diagnosis may reduce CVD mortality.",
  "Based on the biological mechanisms underlying the obesity-breast cancer connections, potential protein biomarkers involved in breast cancer development have been identified, which may be helpful for the estimation of breast cancer risk. This study aimed to carry out a comprehensive overview of systematic reviews on circulating levels of obesity-related protein biomarkers for female breast cancer risk to provide a solid reference for potential breast cancer predictors.Comprehensive literature searches were conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews up to Dec 2019. The AMSTAR tool was used for the methodological quality assessment of the included systematic reviews. Evidence was reported narratively.A total of 28 relevant systematic reviews which were mostly of moderate quality were included in the overview. Protein biomarkers relating to adipokines, insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) axis, inflammatory cytokines and sex hormones were investigated. Higher levels of circulating IGF-1, IGF-binding protein-3, leptin and resistin were found to be associated with an increased risk of premenopausal breast cancer; lower levels of circulating adiponectin and higher levels of circulating c-reactive protein, leptin, and resistin were found to be associated with an increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer.We found sufficient evidence on the positive associations between certain obesity-related protein biomarkers with pre- and/or postmenopausal breast cancer risk. These biomarkers could be used jointly as predictors, so as to build a comprehensive risk predictive score for female breast cancer.CRD42020175328.",
  "The activation of insulin pathways is hypothesized to promote tumor growth and worsen breast cancer survival. Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) can lead to a higher risk of insulin resistance and may affect survival. The authors prospectively evaluated the relation of postdiagnostic SSB and artificially sweetened beverage (ASB) consumption with mortality among women with breast cancer.In total, 8863 women with stage I through III breast cancer were identified during follow-up of the Nurses' Health Study (NHS; 1980-2010) and Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII; 1991-2011). Women completed a validated food frequency questionnaire every 4 years after diagnosis and were followed until death or the end of follow-up (2014 for the NHS and 2015 for the NHSII). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of breast cancer-specific and all-cause mortality after adjusting for measures of adiposity and other potential predictors of cancer survival.With a median follow-up of 11.5 years, 2482 deaths were prospectively documented, including 1050 deaths from breast cancer. Compared with women who had no consumption, women who had SSB consumption after diagnosis had higher breast cancer-specific mortality (>1 to 3 servings per week: HR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.09-1.58]; >3 servings per week: HR, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.12-1.62]; P<sub>trend</sub> = .001) and all-cause mortality (>1 to 3 servings per week: HR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.07-1.37]; >3 servings per week: HR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.13-1.45]; P<sub>trend</sub> = .0001). In contrast, ASB consumption was not associated with higher breast cancer-specific or all-cause mortality. Furthermore, replacing 1 serving per day of SSB consumption with 1 serving per day of ASB consumption was not associated with a lower risk of mortality.Higher postdiagnostic SSB consumption among breast cancer survivors was associated with higher breast cancer-specific mortality and death from all causes.",
  "Physical activity has been consistently linked to decreased incidence of breast cancer and a substantial increase in the length of survival of patients with breast cancer. However, the understanding of how applied physical forces directly regulate breast cancer remains limited. We investigated the role of mechanical forces in altering the chemoresistance, proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer cells. We found that applied mechanical tension can dramatically alter gene expression in breast cancer cells, leading to decreased proliferation, increased resistance to chemotherapeutic treatment and enhanced adhesion to inflamed endothelial cells and collagen I under fluidic shear stress. A mechanistic analysis of the pathways involved in these effects supported a complex signaling network that included Abl1, Lck, Jak2 and PI3K to regulate pro-survival signaling and enhancement of adhesion under flow. Studies using mouse xenograft models demonstrated reduced proliferation of breast cancer cells with orthotopic implantation and increased metastasis to the skull when the cancer cells were treated with mechanical load. Using high throughput mechanobiological screens we identified pathways that could be targeted to reduce the effects of load on metastasis and found that the effects of mechanical load on bone colonization could be reduced through treatment with a PI3K\u03b3 inhibitor.",
  "Vitamin K<sub>2</sub> (VK2) has been reported to induce apoptosis in many types of cancer cells including leukemia. However, there are no precise reports regarding the breast cancer cells. From the stand point of clinical implications of VK2 including chemoprevention, we investigated the effects of VK2 on breast cancer cell lines.Breast cancer cell lines were cultured with VK2, and the cytotoxicity and cell death phenotype were examined. The HL-60 leukemia cells were used as a control for VK2-induced apoptosis.VK2 exhibited the cytotoxic effect, especially in triple negative breast cancer cell lines, namely, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468. However, in contrast to HL-60 cells, typical features of the cells undergoing apoptosis, such as chromatin condensation, nuclear fragments, and cleavage of caspase-3 were not detected. Transmission electron microscopy exhibited an increased number of autophagosomes/autolysosomes with plasma membrane integrity. An autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenine, apparently attenuated VK2-induced cytotoxicity, which indicated the involvement of autophagy-dependent cell death. Interestingly, both VK2-induced non-apoptotic cell death in MDA-MB-231 cells and VK2-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells were suppressed in the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers. Therefore, ROS production by VK2 seems to be located up-stream in the molecular machinery for both the types of cell death execution.The VK2 induced non-apoptotic cell death along with autophagy, in triple negative breast cancer cell lines. Cell death phenotype induced by VK2 appears to differ among the type of cancers. This suggests the possibility of using VK2 for the breast cancer therapy.",
  "Our study aimed to improve the dosimetry of post modified radical mastectomy intensity-modulated radiotherapy (PMRM-IMRT) for left-sided breast cancer patients by tailoring and minimizing PTV expansion three-dimensionally utilizing 4D CT combined with on-board cone beam CT (CBCT).We enrolled a total of 10 consecutive left-sided breast cancer patients to undergo PMRM-IMRT. We measured the intra-fractional CTV displacement attributed to respiratory movement by defining 9 points on the left chest wall and quantifying their displacement by using the 4D CT, and measured the inter-fractional CTV displacement resulting from the integrated effect of respiratory movement, thoracic deformation and set up errors by using CBCT. We created 3 different PMRM-IMRT plans for each of the patients using PTV<sub>t</sub> (tailored PTV expansion three-dimensionally), PTV<sub>0.5</sub> and PTV<sub>0.7</sub> (isotropic 0.5- cm and isotropic 0.7- cm expanding margin of CTV), respectively. We performed paired samples t test to establish a hierarchy in terms of plan quality and dosimetric benefits. P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 was considered statistically significant.The inter-fractional CTV displacement (2.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.2\u00a0mm vertically, 2.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.3\u00a0mm longitudinally, and 1.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0mm laterally) measured by CBCT was much larger than the intra-fractional one (0.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0mm vertically, 0.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0\u00a0mm longitudinally, and 0.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0mm laterally, respectively) measured by 4D CT. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy with tailored PTV expansion based on inter-fractional CTV displacement had dosimetrical advantages over those with PTV<sub>0.5</sub> or those with PTV<sub>0.7</sub> owing to its perfect PTV dose coverage and better OARs sparing(especially of heart and left lung).The CTV displacement in PMRM-IMRT predominantly arises from inter-fraction rather than from intra-fraction during natural respiration and differs in 3 coordinate axes either inter-fractionally or intra-fractionally. Tailoring and minimizing PTV expansion three-dimensionally significantly improves the dosimetry of PMRM-IMRT for left-sided breast cancer patients.",
  "The proliferative activity of the Ki-67 index is important in decision-making of adjuvant treatments in early breast cancer. Its reliability can be reduced by inter-observer variability. This analysis' objective is to evaluate the robustness of Ki-67 values within one center over 5 years and to compare its distribution with a published dataset.Ki-67 indices of early breast cancers treated at St. Gallen Breast Center were collected (2010-2014; 1154 patients). Distribution of Ki-67 values was analyzed for each year, along with histologic subtype and grading. Tumors were classified into intrinsic subtypes using two definitions: 2013\u00a0St. Gallen Consensus and the refined definition by Maisonneuve (\"Milano Group\"). Our institution's Ki-67 cut-off value was adjusted to obtain the same distribution of luminal subtypes as published data of the Milano Group.Ki-67 index frequency distributions were comparable between years (mean 26-30%, median 22-26%). Shape and position of the distribution curves were nearly identical. Ki-67 values correlated with tumor grade (median Ki-67: G1: 12.0%, G2: 21%, G3: 38%). Standard deviation of Ki-67 increased with higher grading (G1: 6.9; G2: 9.2; G3: 18.2; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). According to the 2013 definition (and refined definition respectively), there were 35% (41%) luminal A-like and 65% (59%) luminal B-like tumors. To obtain the same distribution as the Milano group, Ki-67 cut-off needed to be elevated to 22%.Ki-67 index assessment was comparable over many years. Knowledge of one's institution's Ki-67 value distribution is essential for clinical decision-making of adjuvant therapies in early breast cancer.",
  "The discovery of early diagnosis and prognostic markers for breast cancer can significantly improve survival and reduce mortality. LSM1 is known to be involved in the general process of mRNA degradation in complexes containing LSm subunits, but the molecular and biological functions in breast cancer remain unclear. Here, the expression of LSM1 mRNA in breast cancer was estimated using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Oncomine, TIMER and bc-GenExMiner databases. We found that functional LSM1 inactivation caused by mutations and profound deletions predicted poor prognosis in breast cancer (BRCA) patients. LSM1 was highly expressed in both BRCA tissues and cells compared to normal breast tissues/cells. High LSM1 expression is associated with poorer overall survival and disease-free survival. The association between LSM1 and immune infiltration of breast cancer was assessed by TIMER and CIBERSORT algorithms. LSM1 showed a strong correlation with various immune marker sets. Most importantly, pharmacogenetic analysis of BRCA cell lines revealed that LSM1 inactivation was associated with increased sensitivity to refametinib and trametinib. However, both drugs could mimic the effects of LSM1 inhibition and their drug sensitivity was associated with MEK molecules. Therefore, we investigated the clinical application of LSM1 to provide a basis for sensitive diagnosis, prognosis and targeted treatment of breast cancer.",
  "Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway (PAM pathway) plays an important role in the development of breast cancer and are closely associated with the resistance to endocrine therapy in advanced breast cancer. Therefore, anti-cancer treatment targeting key molecules in this signaling pathway has become research hot-spot in recent years. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors bring significant clinical benefit to patients with advanced breast cancer, especially to those with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 2-negative advanced breast cancer. Alpelisib, a PI3K inhibitor, and everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, have been approved by Food and Drug Administration. Based on their high efficacy and relatively good safety profile, expanded indication of everolimus in breast cancer have been approved by National Medical Products Administration. Alpelisib is expected to be approved in China in the near future. The members of the consensus expert panel reached this consensus to comprehensively define the role of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in breast cancer, efficacy and clinical applications of PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors, management of adverse reactions, and PIK3CA mutation detection, in order to promote the understanding of PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors for Chinese oncologists, improve clinical decision-making, and prolong the survival of target patient population.",
  "Vitamin D may protect against breast cancer. Although Black/African American women and Hispanic/Latina women have lower circulating vitamin D levels than non-Hispanic White women, few studies have examined the association between vitamin D and breast cancer within these racial/ethnic groups.The vitamin D-breast cancer association was evaluated using a case-cohort sample of self-identified Black/African American and non-Black Hispanic/Latina women participating in the US-wide Sister Study cohort. Circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (24,25(OH)2D) were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in blood samples collected at the baseline from 415 women (290 Black/African American women and 125 non-Black Hispanic/Latina women) who developed breast cancer. These were compared to concentrations in 1545 women (1084 Black/African American women and 461 Hispanic/Latina women) randomly selected from the cohort. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Over a mean follow-up of 9.2 years, women with circulating 25(OH)D concentrations above the clinical cut point for deficiency (20.0 ng/mL) had lower breast cancer rates than women with concentrations \u2264 20 ng/mL (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.61-1.02). The inverse association was strongest among Hispanic/Latina women (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.29-0.93), with a weaker association observed among Black/African American women (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.68-1.18; P for heterogeneity = 0.13). There were no clear differences by menopausal status, follow-up time, estrogen receptor status, or invasiveness. Neither 24,25(OH)<sub>2</sub> D nor the 24,25(OH)<sub>2</sub> D to 25(OH)D ratio were independently associated with breast cancer risk.This prospective study supports the hypothesis that vitamin D may be protective against breast cancer incidence in women, including non-Black Hispanic/Latina and Black/African American women.Vitamin D may protect against breast cancer. Although women of color have lower average vitamin D levels than non-Hispanic White women, few studies have considered the role of race/ethnicity. In a sample of self-identified Black/African American and Hispanic/Latina women, we observed that vitamin D concentrations measured in blood were inversely associated with breast cancer, particularly among Latinas. These findings indicate that vitamin D may protect women against breast cancer, including those in racial/ethnic groups with low average circulating levels.",
  "A personalized approach to prevention and early detection based on known risk factors should contribute to early diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. We initiated a risk assessment clinic for all women wishing to undergo an individual breast cancer risk assessment.Women underwent a complete breast cancer assessment including a questionnaire, mammogram with evaluation of breast density, collection of saliva sample, consultation with a radiologist, and a breast cancer specialist. Women aged 40 or older, with 0 or 1 first-degree relative with breast cancer diagnosed after the age of 40 were eligible for risk assessment using MammoRisk, a machine learning-based tool that provides an individual 5-year estimated risk of developing breast cancer based on the patient's clinical data and breast density, with or without polygenic risk scores (PRSs). DNA was extracted from saliva samples for genotyping of 76 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. The individual risk was communicated to the patient, with individualized screening and prevention recommendations.A total of 290 women underwent breast cancer assessment, among which 196 women (68%) were eligible for risk assessment using MammoRisk (median age 52, range 40-72). When PRS was added to MammoRisk, 40% (n\u2009=\u200978) of patients were assigned a different risk category, with 28% (n\u2009=\u200955) of patients changing from intermediate to moderate or high risk.Individual risk assessment is feasible in the general population. Screening recommendations could be given based on individual risk. The use of PRS changed the risk score and screening recommendations in 40% of women.",
  "Childbirth at any age confers a transient increased risk for breast cancer in the first decade postpartum and this window of adverse effect extends over two decades in women with late-age first childbirth (>35 years of age). Crossover to the protective effect of pregnancy is dependent on age at first pregnancy, with young mothers receiving the most benefit. Furthermore, breast cancer diagnosis during the 5- to 10-year postpartum window associates with high risk for subsequent metastatic disease. Notably, lactation has been shown to be protective against breast cancer incidence overall, with varying degrees of protection by race, multiparity, and lifetime duration of lactation. An effect for lactation on breast cancer outcome after diagnosis has not been described. We discuss the most recent data and mechanistic insights underlying these epidemiologic findings. Postpartum involution of the breast has been identified as a key mediator of the increased risk for metastasis in women diagnosed within 5-10 years of a completed pregnancy. During breast involution, immune avoidance, increased lymphatic network, extracellular matrix remodeling, and increased seeding to the liver and lymph node work as interconnected pathways, leading to the adverse effect of a postpartum diagnosis. We al discuss a novel mechanism underlying the protective effect of breastfeeding. Collectively, these mechanistic insights offer potential therapeutic avenues for the prevention and/or improved treatment of postpartum breast cancer.",
  "<b>Objective:</b> To explore the surgical strategy of nipple areola complex (NAC) management in central breast cancer. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective analysis was conducted on 164 cases of central breast cancer who underwent surgery treatment from December 2017 to December 2020 in the Breast Center of Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University. Prior to the surgery, the tumor-nipple distance (TND) and the maximum diameter of the tumor were measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The presence of nipple invagination, nipple discharge, and nipple ulceration (including nipple Paget's disease) were recorded accordingly. NAC was preserved in patients with TND\u22650.5 cm, no signs of NAC invasion (nipple invagination, nipple ulceration) and negative intraoperative frozen pathological margin. All patients with signs of NAC involvement, TND<0.5 cm or positive NAC basal resection margin confirmed by intraoperative frozen pathology underwent NAC removal. <i>\u03c7</i>(2) test or Fisher exact test was used to analyze the influencing factors. <b>Results:</b> Of the 164 cases of central breast cancer, 73 cases underwent breast-conserving surgery, 43 cases underwent nipple-areola complex sparing mastectomy (NSM), 34 cases underwent total mastectomy, and the remaining 14 cases underwent skin sparing mastectomy (SSM). Among the 58 cases of NAC resection (including 34 cases of total mastectomy, 14 cases of SSM, and 10 cases of breast-conserving surgery), 25 cases were confirmed tumor involving NAC (total mastectomy in 12 cases, SSM in 9 cases, and breast-conserving surgery in 4 cases). The related factors of NAC involvement included TND (<i>P</i>=0.040) and nipple invagination (<i>P</i>=0.031). There were no correlations between tumor size (<i>P</i>=0.519), lymph node metastasis (<i>P</i>=0.847), bloody nipple discharge (<i>P</i>=0.742) and NAC involvement. During the follow-up period of 12 to 48 months, there was 1 case of local recurrence and 3 cases of distant metastasis. <b>Conclusions:</b> For central breast cancer, data suggest that patients with TND\u22650.5cm, no signs of NAC invasion (nipple invagination, nipple ulceration) and negative NAC margin in intraoperative frozen pathology should be treated with NAC preservation surgery, whereas for those with TND<0.5 cm or accompanied by signs of NAC invasion, NAC should be removed. In addition, nipple reconstruction can be selected to further improve the postoperative appearance of patients with central breast cancer.",
  "To study the specific expression of circular RNA (circRNA) in breast cancer and adjacent normal tissues to identify differentially expressed circRNA in breast cancer patients. To study the correlation between circRNA and clinical data of breast cancer, and to evaluate its potential as a breast cancer biomarker.The differential expression of circRNAs between the breast cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues was screened by Human CircRNA Microarray. Candidate circRNAs verified by qRT-PCR. CircRNA was analyzed by Agilent GeneSpring 13.0 software. SPSS23.0, GraphPad Prism, and Sigmaplot software were used for statistical analysis. Perform <i>T</i> test, one-way ANOVA, curve regression analysis and ROC curve analysis for evaluating the diagnostic value of circular RNA.Among the 2021 differentially expressed circRNAs, 546 were up-regulated and 1475 were down-regulated in breast cancer tissues. The validation study demonstrated that six circRNAs were downregulated. Among them, hsa_circ_0104824 proved high correlation between breast cancer tissues and plasma samples in its expression and diagnostic value.Hsa_circ_0104824 may serve as a promising predictive biomarker and therapeutic target for patients with breast cancer.",
  "Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor and usually occurs in women. Studies have shown that lncRNA nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) contributes to breast cancer progression. This study intends to further investigate the molecular mechanism of NEAT1 in breast cancer.The expression levels of NEAT1, miR-410-3p and Cyclin D1 (CCND1) were detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in breast cancer tissues and cells. Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test were performed to determine the relationship between NEAT1 and overall survival. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay analyzed cell proliferation. Transwell assay was performed to examine cell migration and invasion. The protein levels of CCND1 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins (E-cadherin, N-cadherin and Vimentin) were measured by western blot. The target relationship was predicted by bioinformatics analysis, and confirmed by luciferase reporter assay and RNA Immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. Xenograft analysis was used to evaluate the tumor growth in vivo.NEAT1 and CCND1 were upregulated, while miR-410-3p was down-regulated in breast cancer tissues and cells. Higher NEAT1 expression level was associated with lower survival rate of breast cancer patients. Knockdown of miR-410-3p restored silenced NEAT1-mediated the inhibition of on proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT of breast cancer cells. In addition, NEAT1 regulated CCND1 expression by sponging miR-410-3p in breast cancer cells. NEAT1 knockdown blocked the tumor growth in vivo.NEAT1 induced breast cancer progression by regulating the miR-410-3p/CCND1 axis, indicating that NEAT1 may be a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer.",
  "We present a rare case of male axillary accessory breast cancer, which is extremely rare and is indistinguishable from lymphadenopathy and other malignancies, such as lymphoma and skin-derived tumors. Clinicians should consider accessory breast cancer in the differential diagnosis even in men, particularly in those who present with superficially located tumors with adjacent accessory breast tissue.",
  "The aim of this retrospective study is to compare surgical margins, reoperation rates and local recurrences after breast conserving surgery (BCS) using radioguided occult lesion localization (ROLL) or radioactive seed localization (RSL).We reviewed 744 consecutive patients with impalpable primary invasive breast cancer who underwent BCS at Helsinki University Hospital between 2010 and 2012. ROLL was used in our unit until October 31st, 2011; from November 1st we changed localization method to RSL.318 patients underwent ROLL and 426 RSL. Patients in the RSL group had more often multifocal (p\u202f=\u202f0.013) tumours. No statistically significant differences were found regarding tumour size, specimen weight, histology or grade of tumours or lymph node status. 42 (5.6%) patients were reoperated because of insufficient margins, 13 (4.1%) in the ROLL group and 29 (6.8%) in the RSL group. The reoperation rate was not different between the groups either in the univariable analysis (p\u202f=\u202f0.112) or in the multivariable binary logistic regression analysis (p\u202f=\u202f0.204). Risk factors for reoperations were multifocality of the tumour (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), extensive intraductal component (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), larger tumour size (p\u202f=\u202f0.011), and smaller specimen weight (p\u202f=\u202f0.014). The median follow-up time in the ROLL group was 81 (8-94) months and 64 (3-73) months in the RSL group. The five-year local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) estimates for ROLL and RSL groups were 98.0% and 99.4%, respectively (log-rank test, p\u202f=\u202f0.323).Reoperation rates and LRFS were comparable for ROLL and RSL in patients with impalpable breast cancer treated with BCS.",
  "Research on the role of insulin resistance (IR) in breast cancer risk in premenopausal women is scarce. We aimed to investigate the relationship between IR and the development of breast cancer in premenopausal women.We analyzed the prospective association of IR and incident breast cancer in premenopausal women without breast cancer at baseline using a subsample of the Kangbuk Samsung Health Study.Among 134,488 Korean premenopausal women, 696 women developed incident breast cancers during a median follow-up of 4.34\u00a0years. After adjustment for dense breast and other potential confounders, HR (95% CI) for incident breast cancer comparing HOMA-IR quintiles 2, 3, 4, and 5 to the first quintile was 0.91 (0.71-1.17), 0.89 (0.69-1.15), 0.75 (0.57-0.98), and 0.87 (0.65-1.16), respectively (P for trend\u2009=\u20090.117), while HR (95% CI) comparing insulin quintiles 2, 3, 4, and 5 to the first quintile was 1.02 (0.80-1.30), 0.90 (0.69-1.16), 0.72 (0.54-0.96), and 0.96 (0.72-1.28), respectively (P for trend\u2009=\u20090.151). This pattern did not significantly differ by obesity. These results were attenuated and no longer significant in time-dependent analyses where updated status of insulin and other covariates over time were treated as time-varying covariates.Our findings do not support the positive relationship of IR with the development of breast cancer in premenopausal women, unlike in postmenopausal women. Thus, the role of IR as a risk factor for breast cancer may differ by menopausal status.",
  "To analyze the efficacy and complications of spinal metastasis surgery for breast cancer; to understand the survival and the influencing factors; and to verify the predictive ability of the currently used spinal metastasis cancer survival prediction scoring system on 1 year postoperative survival.A retrospective study was conducted of 54 patients with spinal metastases from breast cancer who underwent open surgery after multidisciplinary consultation in our hospital from January 2017 to October 2020. Patient demographic-related variables, breast cancer-related variables, spinal disorder-related variables, and treatment-related variables were collected. Survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method, 1-way tests were performed using the log-rank method for factors that might affect prognosis, and candidate variables were included in the Cox model for multifactor analysis. The Tomita score, modified Tokuhashi score, modified Bauer score, and modified Katagiri score were examined by plotting the subject operating characteristic curve and calculating the area under the curve. The area under the curve was used to test the predictive ability of the SORG (Skeletal Oncology Research Group) original version, SORG line graph version, and SORG Web version for 1-year postoperative survival in patients with spinal metastases from breast cancer.The average age was 51.3 \u00b1 8.6 years in 54 patients. Twenty-one patients underwent vertebral body debulking surgery, 32 patients underwent palliative canal decompression, and 1 patient underwent vertebral en bloc resection, with an operative time of 229.3 \u00b1 87.6 minutes and intraoperative bleeding of 1018.1 \u00b1 931.1 mL. Postoperatively, the patient experienced significant pain relief and gradual recovery from nerve injury. Major surgical complications included cerebrospinal fluid leakage, secondary spinal cord injury, spinal tumor progression, and broken fixation. The mean survival was 32.2 months, including a 6-month survival of 90.7%, a 1-year survival of 77.8%, and a 2-year survival of 60.3%. Univariate analysis showed that preoperation with neurologic deficits, hormone-insensitive type, with brain metastases were potential risk factors for poor prognosis. Multifactorial analysis showed that hormone-insensitive type and concomitant brain metastasis were independent risk factors associated with poor prognosis. The SORG Web version had good ability to predict 1-year postoperative survival in patients with spinal metastases from breast cancer.Spinal metastasis from breast cancer has good surgical efficacy, low postoperative recurrence rate, and relatively long survival after surgery. Patients with hormone-insensitive type, with brain metastasis, have a poor prognosis, and SORG Web version can predict patients' 1-year survival more accurately.",
  "Previous research has shown that polygenic risk scores (PRSs) can be used to stratify women according to their risk of developing primary invasive breast cancer. This study aimed to evaluate the association between a recently validated PRS of 313 germline variants (PRS<sub>313</sub>) and contralateral breast cancer (CBC) risk. We included 56,068 women of European ancestry diagnosed with first invasive breast cancer from 1990 onward with follow-up from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium. Metachronous CBC risk (N = 1,027) according to the distribution of PRS<sub>313</sub> was quantified using Cox regression analyses. We assessed PRS<sub>313</sub> interaction with age at first diagnosis, family history, morphology, ER status, PR status, and HER2 status, and (neo)adjuvant therapy. In studies of Asian women, with limited follow-up, CBC risk associated with PRS<sub>313</sub> was assessed using logistic regression for 340 women with CBC compared with 12,133 women with unilateral breast cancer. Higher PRS<sub>313</sub> was associated with increased CBC risk: hazard ratio per standard deviation (SD) = 1.25 (95%CI = 1.18-1.33) for Europeans, and an OR per SD = 1.15 (95%CI = 1.02-1.29) for Asians. The absolute lifetime risks of CBC, accounting for death as competing risk, were 12.4% for European women at the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile and 20.5% at the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile of PRS<sub>313</sub>. We found no evidence of confounding by or interaction with individual characteristics, characteristics of the primary tumor, or treatment. The C-index for the PRS<sub>313</sub> alone was 0.563 (95%CI = 0.547-0.586). In conclusion, PRS<sub>313</sub> is an independent factor associated with CBC risk and can be incorporated into CBC risk prediction models to help improve stratification and optimize surveillance and treatment strategies.",
  "Delays in breast cancer care, one important attributable factor for breast cancer being diagnosed at advanced stages, are not systematically studied in many countries. This study assessed the magnitude and factors associated with delays in breast cancer care in Sri Lanka, from symptom detection to treatment initiation.We interviewed 800 consecutively sampled female breast cancer patients, diagnosed within the last 12 months, using context-specific questionnaires and medical records. We defined the cut-off times for delays using international guidelines and features of the national health system and care-seeking patterns in the country. Delays were estimated as proportions with 95% confidence intervals and presented for: (i) presentation delay; (ii) diagnosis delay and (iii) treatment delay. We looked at how sociodemographic and healthcare availability and accessibility at the individual level were associated with delays using multivariate logistic regression, with a P value of 0.05 to define statistical significance.Nearly two-thirds of patients reported a presentation delay (63.3%, 95% confidence interval 59.9-66.6%). A diagnosis delay (36.7%, 95% confidence interval 33.4-40.0%) was also seen among one-third, whereas treatment delays (13.2%, 95% confidence interval 10.8-15.5%) were less common. Low family monthly income (odds ratio 6.3; 95% confidence interval 4.2-9.3) and poor knowledge on breast cancer (odds ratio 2.7; 95% confidence interval 1.8-3.8) were associated with presentation delay. Poor health literacy (odds ratio 1.7; 95% confidence interval 1.1-2.7) and the need to make more than two visits to the first contact health provider prior to diagnosis (odds ratio 7.2; 95% confidence interval 4.6-11.1) were associated with diagnosis delays, whereas directly contacting an appropriate specialised health provider once the lump was detected reduced diagnosis delay (odds ratio 0.3; 95% confidence interval 0.2-0.4). Having undergone a core biopsy (odds ratio 0.5; 95% confidence interval 0.3-0.8) and having a mammogram (odds ratio 0.6; 95% confidence interval 4.7-32.7) reduced the likelihood of treatment delays.Our study findings show that delays in breast cancer care in Sri Lanka are much lower than those in other lower-middle income countries. However, there is significant room for improvement, especially in relation to the excellence in quality of care, such as improving access to mammography services. Periodical estimation of breast cancer delays enabling temporal comparisons will probably provide useful information to policy makers in improving care delivery for breast cancer patients and, hence, is recommended. Such future assessments designed for comparisons between different treatment modalities would provide more information to assist policy decisions in care improvement.",
  "Experimental data showed that endothelial lipase (LIPG) is a crucial player in breast cancer. However, very limited data exists on the role of LIPG on the risk of breast cancer in humans. We examined the LIPG-breast cancer association within our population-based case-control study from Galicia, Spain, BREOGAN (BREast Oncology GAlicia Network). Plasma LIPG and/or OxLDL were measured on 114 breast cancer cases and 82 controls from our case-control study, and were included in the present study. The risk of breast cancer increased with increasing levels of LIPG (multivariable OR for the highest category (95% CI) 2.52 (1.11-5.81), P-trend\u2009=\u20090.037). The LIPG-breast cancer association was restricted to Pre-menopausal breast cancer (Multivariable OR for the highest LIPG category (95% CI) 4.76 (0.94-28.77), P-trend\u2009=\u20090.06, and 1.79 (0.61-5.29), P-trend\u2009=\u20090.372, for Pre-menopausal and Post-menopausal breast cancer, respectively). The LIPG-breast cancer association was restricted to Luminal A breast cancers (Multivariable OR for the highest LIPG category (95% CI) 3.70 (1.42-10.16), P-trend\u2009=\u20090.015, and 2.05 (0.63-7.22), P-trend\u2009=\u20090.311, for Luminal A and non-Luminal A breast cancers, respectively). Subset analysis only based on HER2 receptor indicated that the LIPG-breast cancer relationship was restricted to HER2-negative breast cancers (Multivariable OR for the highest LIPG category (95% CI) 4.39 (1.70-12.03), P-trend\u2009=\u20090.012, and 1.10 (0.28-4.32), P-trend\u2009=\u20090.745, for HER2-negative and HER2-positive tumors, respectively). The LIPG-breast cancer association was restricted to women with high total cholesterol levels (Multivariable OR for the highest LIPG category (95% CI) 6.30 (2.13-20.05), P-trend\u2009=\u20090.018, and 0.65 (0.11-3.28), P-trend\u2009=\u20090.786, among women with high and low cholesterol levels, respectively). The LIPG-breast cancer association was also restricted to non-postpartum breast cancer (Multivariable OR for the highest LIPG category (95% CI) 3.83 (1.37-11.39), P-trend\u2009=\u20090.003, and 2.35 (0.16-63.65), P-trend\u2009=\u20090.396, for non-postpartum and postpartum breast cancer, respectively), although we lacked precision. The LIPG-breast cancer association was more pronounced among grades II and III than grade I breast cancers (Multivariable ORs for the highest category of LIPG (95% CI) 2.73 (1.02-7.69), P-trend\u2009=\u20090.057, and 1.90 (0.61-6.21), P-trend\u2009=\u20090.170, for grades II and III, and grade I breast cancers, respectively). No association was detected for OxLDL levels and breast cancer (Multivariable OR for the highest versus the lowest category (95% CI) 1.56 (0.56-4.32), P-trend\u2009=\u20090.457).",
  "<b>OBJECTIVE.</b> Supplemental screening breast MRI is recommended for women with an estimated lifetime risk of breast cancer of greater than 20-25%. The performance of risk prediction models varies for each individual and across groups of women. The present study investigates the concordance of three breast cancer risk prediction models among women presenting for screening mammography. <b>SUBJECTS AND METHODS.</b> In this prospective study, we calculated the estimated lifetime risk of breast cancer using the modified Gail, Tyrer-Cuzick version 7, and BRCAPRO models for each woman who presented for screening mammography. Per American Cancer Society guidelines, for each woman the risk was categorized as less than 20% or 20% or greater as well as less than 25% or 25% or greater with use of each model. Venn diagrams were constructed to evaluate concordance across models. The McNemar test was used to test differences in risk group allocations between models, with <i>p</i> \u2264 .05 considered to denote statistical significance. <b>RESULTS.</b> Of 3503 screening mammography patients who underwent risk stratification, 3219 (91.9%) were eligible for risk estimation using all three models. Using at least one model, 440 (13.7%) women had a lifetime risk of 20% or greater, including 390 women (12.1%) according to the Tyrer-Cuzick version 7 model, 18 (0.6%) according to the BRCAPRO model, and 141 (4.4%) according to the modified Gail model. Six women (0.2%) had a risk of 20% or greater according to all three models. Women were significantly more likely to be classified as having a high lifetime breast cancer risk by the Tyrer-Cuzick version 7 model compared with the modified Gail model, with thresholds of 20% or greater (odds ratio, 6.4; 95% CI, 4.7-8.7) or 25% or greater (odds ratio, 7.4; 95% CI, 4.7-11.9) used for both models. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> To identify women with a high lifetime breast cancer risk, practices should use estimates of lifetime breast cancer risk derived from multiple risk prediction models.",
  "Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) comprises 8-15\u00a0% of all invasive breast cancers and large population-based studies with >10 years of follow-up are rare. Whether ILC has a long-time prognosis different from that of invasive ductal carcinoma, (IDC) remains controversial.To investigate the excess mortality rate ratio (EMRR) of patients with ILC and IDC and to correlate survival with clinical parameters in a large population-based cohort.From 1989 through 2006, we identified 17,481 patients diagnosed with IDC (n\u00a0=\u00a014,583) or ILC (n\u00a0=\u00a02898), younger than 76 years from two Swedish Regional Cancer Registries. Relative survival (RS) during 20 years of follow up was analysed.ILC was significantly associated with older age, larger tumours, ER positivity and well differentiated tumours. We noticed an improved survival for patients with ILC during the first five years, excess mortality rate ratio (EMRR) 0.64 (CI 95\u00a0% 0.53-0.77). This was shifted to a significant decreased survival 10-15 years after diagnosis (EMRR 1.49, CI 95\u00a0% 1.16-1.93). After 20 years the relative survival rates were similar, 0.72 for ILC and 0.73 for IDC.During the first five years after surgery, the EMRR was lower for patients with ILC as compared to patients with IDC, but during the years 10-15 after surgery, we observed an increased EMRR for patients with ILC as compared to IDC. These EMRR between ILC and IDC were statistically significant but the absolute difference in excess mortality between the two groups was small.",
  "Laterality in breast cancer means an increased frequency of left-sided breast cancers compared to right-sided breast cancers ranging between 1.05 and 1.26. It was first described in 1935 by Fellenberg, Sweden. The explanation of this phenomenon is not clear, but the association with other factors was found. This study aimed to explore the laterality of breast cancer in Bahrain as a model for Arabian countries. The association of laterality with the clinicopathological characteristics of the tumor was also analyzed to explore any applied clinical value.This is a cross-sectional, retrospective review of a particular ethnic population to study laterality of breast cancer versus a number of clinicopathological factors, as well as prognosis. The study analyzed 228 breast cancer patients treated in Arabian Gulf University facilities in Bahrain between 1999 and 2020. Three bilateral breast cancer and two malignant phyllodes patients were excluded. The following variables were analyzed: laterality ratio (Lt/Rt) and the association between laterality and clinicopathological characteristics (age at diagnosis, family history of malignancy, size of the tumor, tumor grade, histological type, hormonal receptors and HER2, axillary lymph node status, tumor stage, five-year survival rate, nulliparity, and multifocality).The laterality ratio (Lt/Rt) was 1.06 and was 0.97 for patients below 50\u2009years of age, and 1.19 for patients 50\u2009years of age and above. Analysis of our data showed a statistically significant association between laterality and tumor stage (p. value =0.025) at presentation, and laterality and family history of malignancy (p. value =0.052). Right-sided breast cancer was associated with a higher positive family history of malignancy and an increased ratio of locally advanced and metastatic disease, and a reduced 5-year survival in relation to size and stage. Left-sided breast cancer was associated with higher early tumor stage.This is the first study exploring the issue of breast cancer laterality in a defined Arabian population. The laterality ratio in this study was 1.06, which is consistent with the globally published range (1.05 to 1.26) and is increasing with increasing age. The association between breast cancer laterality, and the hormonal and HER2 is still not widely addressed in the available literature, although other clinicopathological characteristics were extensively analyzed.",
  "Dendritic cells (DCs) are central for the initiation and regulation of innate and adaptive immunity in the tumor microenvironment. As such, many kinds of DC-targeted vaccines have been developed to improve cancer immunotherapy in numerous clinical trials. Targeted delivery of antigens and adjuvants to DCs in vivo represents an important approach for the development of DC vaccines. However, nonspecific activation of systemic DCs and the preparation of optimal immunodominant tumor antigens still represent major challenges.We loaded the immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducers human neutrophil elastase (ELANE) and Hiltonol (TLR3 agonist) into \u03b1-lactalbumin (\u03b1-LA)-engineered breast cancer-derived exosomes to form an in situ DC vaccine (HELA-Exos). HELA-Exos were identified by transmission electron microscopy, nanoscale flow cytometry, and Western blot analysis. The targeting, killing, and immune activation effects of HELA-Exos were evaluated in vitro. The tumor suppressor and immune-activating effects of HELA-Exos were explored in immunocompetent mice and patient-derived organoids.HELA-Exos possessed a profound ability to specifically induce ICD in breast cancer cells. Adequate exposure to tumor antigens and Hiltonol following HELA-Exo-induced ICD of cancer cells activated type one conventional DCs (cDC1s) in situ and cross-primed tumor-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses, leading to potent tumor inhibition in a poorly immunogenic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) mouse xenograft model and patient-derived tumor organoids.HELA-Exos exhibit potent antitumor activity in both a mouse model and human breast cancer organoids by promoting the activation of cDC1s in situ and thus improving the subsequent tumor-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses. The strategy proposed here is promising for generating an in situ DC-primed vaccine and can be extended to various types of cancers. Scheme 1. Schematic illustration of HELA-Exos as an in situ DC-primed vaccine for breast cancer. (A) Allogenic breast cancer-derived exosomes isolated from MDA-MB-231 cells were genetically engineered to overexpress \u03b1-LA and simultaneously loaded with the ICD inducers ELANE and Hiltonol (TLR3 agonist) to generate HELA-Exos. (B) Mechanism by which HELA-Exos activate DCs in situ in a mouse xenograft model ofTNBC. HELA-Exos specifically homed to the TME and induced ICD in cancer cells, which resulted in the increased release of tumor antigens, Hiltonol, and DAMPs, as well as the uptake of dying tumor cells by cDC1s. The activated cDC1s then cross-primed tumor-reactive CD8+ T cell responses. (C) HELA-Exos activated DCs in situ in the breast cancer patient PBMC-autologous tumor organoid coculture system.DCs: dendritic cells; \u03b1-LA: \u03b1-lactalbumin; HELA-Exos: Hiltonol-ELANE-\u03b1-LA-engineered exosomes; ICD: immunogenic cell death; ELANE: human neutrophil elastase; TLR3: Toll-like receptor 3; TNBC: triple-negative breast cancer; TME: tumor microenvironment; DAMPs: damage-associated molecular patterns; cDC1s: type 1 conventional dendritic cells; PBMCs: peripheral blood mononuclear cells.",
  "Because of the high heterogeneity of breast cancer outcome, identification of novel prognostic biomarkers is critical to improve patient stratification and guide precise treatment. We examined the prognostic value of gamma-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT) expression in a training set of 416 breast cancer patients and a validation set of 210 patients, and performed functional studies to investigate the functions and underlying mechanisms of GILT on breast cancer prognosis. Our results indicated that high GILT expression in breast cancer cells was associated with improved disease-free survival (DFS; hazard ratio [HR]\u00a0=\u00a00.189, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.099-0.361) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS; HR\u00a0=\u00a00.187, 95% CI: 0.080-0.437) of breast cancer patients both in the training set and the external validation set (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.453, 95% CI: 0.235-0.873 for DFS, HR\u00a0=\u00a00.488, 95% CI: 0.245-0.970 for BCSS). In vitro and in vivo studies showed that GILT overexpression inhibited breast cancer cells proliferation, invasion, migration and tumor formation in nude mice and increased sensitivity of breast cancer cells to standard treatment. Proteomics analysis indicated that GILT inhibited reactive oxygen species (ROS) and autophagy activation in breast cancer cells, and GILT overexpression-mediated tumor growth was further enhanced in the presence of autophagy or ROS inhibitors. Our results demonstrate that GILT expression can be effectively used to predict the prognosis and guide treatment strategies of breast cancer patients.",
  "Breast cancer is a top dangerous killer for women. An accurate early diagnosis of breast cancer is the primary step for treatment. A novel breast cancer detection model called SAFNet is proposed based on ultrasound images and deep learning. We employ a pre-trained ResNet-18 embedded with the spatial attention mechanism as the backbone model. Three randomized network models are trained for prediction in the SAFNet, which are fused by majority voting to produce more accurate results. A public ultrasound image dataset is utilized to evaluate the generalization ability of our SAFNet using 5-fold cross-validation. The simulation experiments reveal that the SAFNet can produce higher classification results compared with four existing breast cancer classification methods. Therefore, our SAFNet is an accurate tool to detect breast cancer that can be applied in clinical diagnosis.",
  "The active thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3) has been found to have an estrogen-like effect on breast cancer cells. Thyroid hormone receptor alpha-2 (THR\u03b1-2) acts as an antagonist for triiodothyronine (T3) signaling, and a low expression has been associated with unfavorable tumor characteristics and a higher mortality in breast cancer. However, the evidence are not conclusive. The present study evaluates tumor-specific THR\u03b1-2 expression in invasive breast cancers and its association with tumor characteristics and long-term mortality in a large population.The Malm\u00f6 Diet and Cancer Study (MDCS), a population-based cohort in Sweden that included 17,035 women from 1991 to 1996, was used. Women diagnosed with breast cancer during 1991-2010 were eligible for inclusion. A tissue micro array was constructed from stored tumor material and stained for THR\u03b1-2 using immunohistochemistry. Tumors from 654 patients were scored regarding the intensity and the fraction of cells stained, then dichotomized into low or high expression. Date and cause of death were collected up until 2018-12-31. Tumor- and patient characteristics were available from the MDCS. Missing data was imputed using chained equations. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for low vs high expression of THR\u03b1-2 related to specific tumor factors. Mortality was evaluated with Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression, rendering hazard ratios (HRs). Analyses were also stratified for estrogen receptor (ER) status.We found strong evidence of an association between low THR\u03b1-2 and unfavorable tumor characteristics, including estrogen receptor negativity: OR 4.04 (95% CI 2.28-7.15) and tumor size\u2009>\u200920-50\u00a0mm: OR 2.20 (95% CI 1.39-3.49). We found evidence of increased breast cancer-specific mortality for women with low THR\u03b1-2, HR 1.38 (95% CI 0.96-1.99), which remained after adjusting for age at diagnosis, HR 1.48 (95% CI 1.03-2.14), but not after adjusting for relevant prognostic factors, HR 0.98 (95% CI 0.66-1.45). THR\u03b1-2 expression in ER-negative tumors had an inverse correlation with overall mortality, HR 0.27 (95% CI 0.11-0.65).Low tumor-specific THR\u03b1-2 expression was in this study associated with prognostically unfavorable tumor characteristics and a higher mortality in breast cancer, but not independent from other prognostic factors.",
  "To evaluate and quantify potential sociodemographic disparities in breast cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the use of telemedicine.We fielded a 52-item web-based questionnaire from 14 May 2020 to 1 July 2020 in partnership with several U.S.-based breast cancer advocacy groups. Individuals aged 18 or older were eligible for this study if they: (1) received routine breast cancer screening; OR (2) were undergoing diagnostic evaluation for breast cancer; OR (3) had ever been diagnosed with breast cancer. We used descriptive statistics to understand the extent of cancer care delay and telemedicine adoption and used multivariable logistic regression models to estimate the association of sociodemographic factors with odds of COVID-19-related delays in care and telemedicine use.Of 554 eligible survey participants, 493 provided complete data on demographic and socioeconomic factors and were included in the analysis. Approximately half (n = 248, 50.3%) had a personal history of breast cancer. Overall, 188 (38.1%) participants had experienced any COVID-19-related delay in care including screening, diagnosis, or treatment, and 339 (68.8) reported having at least one virtual appointment during the study period. Compared to other insurance types, participants with Medicaid insurance were 2.58 times more likely to report a COVID-19-related delay in care (OR 2.58, 95% Cl: 1.05, 6.32; <i>p</i> = 0.039). Compared to participants with a household income of less than USD 50,000, those with a household income of USD 150,000 or more were 2.38 (OR 2.38, 95% Cl: 1.09, 5.17; <i>p</i> = 0.029) times more likely to adopt virtual appointments. Self-insured participants were 70% less likely to use virtual appointment compared to those in other insurance categories (OR 0.28, 95% Cl: 0.11, 0.73; <i>p</i> = 0.009).The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on breast cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment, and accelerated the delivery of virtual care. Lower-income groups and patients with certain insurance categories such as Medicaid or self-insured could be more likely to experience care delay or less likely to use telemedicine. Careful attention must be paid to vulnerable groups to insure equity in breast cancer-related service utilization and telemedicine access during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.",
  "In estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer (BC), young age is associated with poor prognosis. While very young patients respond better to chemotherapy, chemotherapy is less effective in ER-positive tumors than in ER-negative tumors. The authors tried to evaluate chemotherapy response of very young patients with ER-positive BC by pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy excluding the effect of endocrine treatment to the extent possible.We collected individual patient data from 1992 to 2013 from the Korean Breast Cancer Society (KBCS). Total 1048 ER-positive and 797 ER-negative patients aged <\u200950\u2009years who had been treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy were included for analysis. We compared pCR rate between patients aged <\u200935\u2009years with ER-positive tumors and the other groups.The proportion of patients aged <\u200935\u2009years was 14.0% of patients with ER-positive BC in this cohort of under 50\u2009years old, and 16.8% of patients with ER-negative BC in this cohort of under 50\u2009years old. Although most characteristics of tumors according to age were comparable, tumors with high Ki-67 expression were more common in patients aged <\u200935\u2009years than in patients aged 35-49\u2009years in both ER-positive and -negative group (P\u2009=\u20090.001). Breast conservation rates were not significantly different according to age (44.2% vs. 46.8% in ER-positive group, 55.2% vs. 48.0% in ER-negative group). pCR rate was not different according to age in ER-positive group (P\u2009=\u20090.71) but significantly better in patients aged <\u200935\u2009years in ER-negative group (P\u2009=\u20090.009). After adjusting for confounding variables, young patients maintained the higher probability of pCR than older patients in ER-negative tumors. However, pCR rate did not differ according to age in ER-positive tumors. In multivariate analysis, young age (<\u200935\u2009years) was correlated with poor overall survival (P\u2009=\u20090.003, HR\u2009=\u20091.98) and there was only one event in a few patients achieved pCR in ER-positive group.Chemotherapy response based on pCR was not better in young patients (<\u200935\u2009years) with ER-positive BC than in older premenopausal patients with non-metastatic ER-positive BC. Young age cannot be a predictive factor of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in ER-positive BC. Different biological characteristics such as high proliferative index should be considered.Retrospectively registered.",
  "<b>Objective:</b> To analyze the current status of breast cancer screening among females in Urban Beijing Cancer Screening Program, 2014-2019. <b>Methods:</b> Based on an on-going cancer screening program launched by the National Urban Cancer Screening Program, women residences aged 40 to 69 were recruited from 80 streets in six districts of Beijing (Dongcheng, Xicheng, Chaoyang, Haidian, Fengtai and Shijingshan District) using cluster sampling method. General demographic information and potential risk factors, results of clinical examination and follow-up outcomes of the target population (diagnosed breast cancer or not) were collected using epidemiological questionnaire, risk evaluation, clinical examination using ultrasound and (or) joint screening with mammography and follow-up, respectively. Proportion of high-risk cases evaluated by the questionnaire, recall rate, proportion of cases with BI-RADS grade 3 and BI-RADS grade 4/5, proportion of the cases with stage 0 or I, incidence rate and cumulative incidence rate were calculated. Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (<i>HR</i>) and 95% confidence interval (95%<i>CI</i>) among females who experienced different screening scenario. <b>Results:</b> A total of 53 916 women with the age of (57.2\u00b17.3) completed high-risk assessment were included into analysis. The proportion of overweigh and obesity were 40.90% (22 053 cases) and 15.34% (8 270 cases), respectively. A total of 17 535 cases (32.52%) were evaluated as positive case detected by the questionnaire. The clinical recall rate was 47.64% (8 353 cases) among the high-risk females. The positive rate detected by ultrasound or mammography alone was 1.84% and 4.00%, while the suspicious positive detection rates were 14.50% and 17.83%, respectively. The positive rate and suspicious positive rate detected by joint screening using ultrasound and mammography were 5.44% and 27.74% respectively. In total, 252 cases were diagnosed with breast cancer after an average of 2.68 years follow-up. The incidence rate and cumulative incidence rate of breast cancer were 174.34/100 000 person years and 470/100 000, respectively. The early detection rate was 68.6% among the residences who received clinical examination. Compared with the negative residence evaluated by the questionnaire, the positive cases has a 55% higher risk of diagnosed with breast cancer (<i>HR</i>=1.55, 95%<i>CI</i>:1.20-2.00); Cases that recognized by baseline ultrasound and mammography joint screening as BI-RADS 4/5 and BI-RADS 3 have higher risk of diagnosed with breast cancer than that of with the results of BI-RADS 1-2, with the <i>HR</i> of 12.60 (95%<i>CI</i>:6.49-24.47) and 1.89 (0.93-3.83), respectively. <b>Conclusion:</b> Females with high risk of breast cancer in Beijing have a better recall rate of receiving the clinical screening examination. Joint using ultrasonography and mammography in breast cancer screening can improve the positive detection rate among high risk females.",
  "Increasing age is a well-recognized risk factor for breast cancer. With an increase in life expectancy of women, more older patients are diagnosed with breast cancer. This study aimed to identify the variations in breast cancer attributes and mortality in different age groups in New Zealand.This was a retrospective study of data from the Auckland Breast Cancer Register between 1 June 2000 and 28 February 2017. Patients who were diagnosed through Breast Screen were included. Group A included those aged between 45 and 69\u2009years. Group B included individuals with an age of 70\u2009years or above.From June 2000 to February 2017, a total of 6304 new cases of new breast cancer were diagnosed through Auckland Breast Screen, with 5788 patients in group A and 516 patients in group B. Group B was more likely to have the lower grade invasive cancers, with fewer grade 3 cancers. Oestrogen receptor positivity was more pronounced in group B, along with progesterone receptor positivity. Conversely, HER-2 receptor was less likely to be positive in group B. There was a significantly higher breast cancer-related mortality in group B (6.0% versus 2.7%). Mortality related to other causes was also much higher in group B as compared to that in group A (12.8% versus 2.5%).Women aged 70\u2009years or above generally tend to have a more favourable type of breast cancer, with a lower tumour grade, oestrogen and progesterone receptor positivity, and lower rate of HER-2 overexpression.",
  "Breast cancer is a commonly occurring disease in women all over the world. Mammogram is an efficient technique used for screening and identification of abnormalities over the breast region. Earlier identification of breast cancer enhances the prognosis of patients and is mainly based on the experience of the radiologist in interpretation of mammogram with quality of image. The advent of Deep Learning (DL) and Computer Vision techniques is widely used to perform breast cancer diagnosis. This paper presents a new Optimal Multi-Level Thresholding-based Segmentation with DL enabled Capsule Network (OMLTS-DLCN) breast cancer diagnosis model utilizing digital mammograms. The OMLTS-DLCN model involves an Adaptive Fuzzy based median filtering (AFF) technique as a pre-processing step to eradicate the noise that exists in the mammogram images. Besides, Optimal Kapur's based Multilevel Thresholding with Shell Game Optimization (SGO) algorithm (OKMT-SGO) is applied for breast cancer segmentation. In addition, the proposed model involves a CapsNet based feature extractor and Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) classification model is employed to detect the existence of breast cancer. The diagnostic outcomes of the presented OMLTS-DLCN technique is examined by means of benchmark Mini-MIAS dataset and DDSM dataset. The experimental values obtained highlights the superior performance of the OMLTS-DLCN model with a higher accuracy of 98.50 and 97.55% on the Mini-MIAS dataset and DDSM dataset, respectively.",
  "The transition from a breast cancer patient to a survivor can be associated with significant physical, psychological, and social challenges. Development of multidisciplinary evidence-based care during the post-treatment period is a key area of cancer research. This study examined survivorship issues, unmet needs and perceptions about care among a cohort of breast cancer survivors.Participants were 130 women diagnosed with breast cancer for at least one year, and attending a hospital breast or oncology outpatient clinic. They completed a series of self-report questionnaires assessing demographic and clinical characteristics, unmet needs, severity of survivorship issues, use of multidisciplinary services, clinical benchmarks, survivorship care satisfaction, and suggestions for service improvements.There was an average of 4.9 unmet survivorship needs, with 67% of participants reporting at least one unmet need. Fear of cancer recurrence, stress, coordination of medical care and negative iatrogenic impacts of hormonal treatments were key concerns. The cancer support team typically consisted of medical and nursing staff, and family/friends, and most were satisfied with their survivorship care. There was minimal use of other multidisciplinary clinicians and support groups. Provision of additional dietary and cancer recurrence education, and a written treatment plan were identified as key areas of service improvement.Despite high satisfaction ratings, survivorship issues and unmet needs were relatively common, particularly among younger participants. Use of multidisciplinary care was inconsistent and overall underutilised.Ongoing specific evaluation and optimisation of existing models of multidisciplinary survivorship care are essential in meeting the complex needs of breast cancer survivors.",
  "Tamoxifen is an estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist that is most commonly used for the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer. However, tamoxifen resistance remains a major cause of cancer recurrence and progression. Here, we aimed to identify hub genes implicated in the progression and prognosis of ER-positive breast cancer following tamoxifen treatment. Microarray data (GSE9893) for 155 tamoxifen-treated primary ER-positive breast cancer samples were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. In total, 1706 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 859 up-regulated and 847 down-regulated genes, were identified between relapse and relapse-free samples. Weighted correlation network analysis clustered genes into 13 modules, among which the tan and blue modules were the most significantly related to prognosis. From these two modules, we further identified and validated two prognosis-related hub genes (G-rich RNA sequence binding factor 1 (GRSF1) and microtubule-associated protein \u03c4 (MAPT)) via survival analysis based on several publicly available datasets. High expression of GRSF1 predicted poor prognosis, whereas MAPT indicated favorable outcomes in ER-positive breast cancer. Using breast cancer cell lines and tissue samples, we confirmed that GRSF1 was significantly up-regulated and MAPT was down-regulated in the tamoxifen-resistant group compared with the tamoxifen-sensitive group. The prognostic value of GRSF1 and MAPT was also verified in 48 tamoxifen-treated ER-positive breast cancer patients in our hospital. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) suggested that GRSF1 was potentially involved in RNA degradation and cell cycle pathways, while MAPT was strongly linked to immune-related signaling pathways. Taken together, our findings established novel prognostic biomarkers to predict tamoxifen sensitivity, which may facilitate individualized management of breast cancer.",
  "Breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy (BCP) is uncommon, and thus there is limited evidence on its treatment. However, the incidence of BCP is increasing probably due to women having children at an older age. We aimed to clarify the practice patterns and limitations in treatment for BCP in Japan.A cross-sectional survey was developed for board-certified Japanese breast cancer specialists (n\u2009=\u20091583) to evaluate their knowledge, attitude, experience, and practice patterns regarding BCP. Survey items also included questions regarding potential barriers of practice toward patients diagnosed during pregnancy and respondents' background.In March 2018, 492 (31.1%) breast oncologists responded to the survey. Among them, 234 (48%) respondents had the experience of treating at least one case of BCP. The accuracy of knowledge about BCP was evaluated by three items regarding BCP treatment from the latest Japanese Breast Cancer Society treatment guideline, and 265 (54%) were categorized to have \"appropriate knowledge\". Majority of the physicians (89%) have responded that patients should be treated in a center where both a cancer-treating team and obstetrician exist, and 48% responded that treating patients by the collaboration of cancer-treating team and obstetric team in different institutes is an alternative reasonable option.Interest, knowledge, and awareness of the guidelines appear to influence physician attitude, and thus it is urgently important to lay out educational materials and learning opportunities regarding BCP for breast specialists. A regional network of oncologists, obstetricians, and pediatricians to support the BCP patients should be developed.",
  "Although breast cancer is the most common cancer among Sri Lankan women, there is little published data on patient characteristics and treatment in the local context. We aimed to describe disease characteristics and management in a large contemporary cohort of women with breast cancer at the National Cancer Institute of Sri Lanka (NCISL).All women with invasive primary breast cancers diagnosed during 2016-2020 were identified from the NCISL breast cancer registry. The NCISL sees approximately 40% of all cancer patients in Sri Lanka. Cancer stage at diagnosis was defined according to the Tumour, Node, and Metastasis (TNM) staging system and the Estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptor status was determined based on the results of immunohistochemistry tests. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the study cohort and treatment patterns.Over 5100 patients were diagnosed with breast cancer during the study period at the NCISL. The mean age of the women was 56 (SD 12) years. Common co-morbidities were hypertension (n\u2009=\u20091566, 30%) and diabetes mellitus (n\u2009=\u20091196, 23%). Two thirds (66%) of the cancers were early stage (stage I & II) at diagnosis. ER/PR positivity rate was 72% and HER-2 positivity rate was 22%. Two thirds of the women had undergone mastectomy while 68% had undergone axillary clearance. The rate of chemotherapy delivery was 91% for women with node positive disease while 77% of eligible women (i.e., after wide local excision or with >\u20093 positive lymph nodes) had received adjuvant radiotherapy. Endocrine therapy was initiated in 88% of eligible women with hormone receptor positive disease while rate of trastuzumab use was 59% among women with HER2 positive breast cancer.High percentage of advanced breast cancer at diagnosis and high prevalence of comorbidities are some of the major challenges faced in the management of breast cancer in Sri Lanka. Given that stage at diagnosis is the most important prognostic factor determining survival, greater efforts are needed to promote early diagnosis of breast cancer. Considerable lapses in the concordance between guideline recommendations and the delivery of cancer care warrants closer assessment and intervention.",
  "Emerging data suggest that higher radiation doses in post-mastectomy radiotherapy may be associated with an increased risk of reconstruction complications. This study aimed to validate previous findings regarding the impact of radiation dose on complications among women with breast cancer using a multi-center dataset.Fifteen institutions participated, and women with breast cancer who received radiotherapy after either autologous or prosthetic breast reconstruction were included. The primary endpoint was major post-radiation therapy complications requiring re-operation for explantation, flap failure, or bleeding control.In total, 314 patients were included. Radiotherapy was performed using both conventional fractionation and hypofractionation in various schedules. The range of the radiation therapy dose in Equivalent Dose in 2\u00a0Gy fractions (EQD2; \u03b1/\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a03.5) varied from 43.4 to 71.0\u00a0Gy (median dose: 48.6\u00a0Gy). Boost radiation therapy was administered to 49 patients. Major post-radiation therapy complications were observed in 24 (7.6%) patients. In multivariate analysis, an increasing EQD2 per Gy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.58, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.26-1.98; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), current smoking status (OR: 25.48, 95% CI: 1.56-415.65; p\u00a0=\u00a00.023), and prosthetic breast reconstruction (OR: 9.28, 95% CI: 1.84-46.70; p\u00a0=\u00a00.007) were independently associated with an increased risk of major complications.A dose-response relationship between radiation dose and the risk of complications was validated in this multi-center dataset. In this context, we hypothesize that the use of hypofractionated radiotherapy (40\u00a0Gy in 15 fractions) may improve breast reconstruction outcomes. Our multi-center prospective observational study (NCT03523078) is underway to further validate this hypothesis.",
  "We investigated the associations of reproductive factors with the percentage of epithelium, stroma, and fat tissue in benign breast biopsy samples.This study included 983 cancer-free women with biopsy-confirmed benign breast disease (BBD) within the Nurses' Health Study and Nurses' Health Study II cohorts. The percentage of each tissue type (epithelium, stroma, and fat) was measured on whole-section images with a deep-learning technique. All tissue measures were log-transformed in all the analyses to improve normality. The data on reproductive variables and other breast cancer risk factors were obtained from biennial questionnaires. Generalized linear regression was used to examine the associations of reproductive factors with the percentage of tissue types, while adjusting for known breast cancer risk factors.As compared to parous women, nulliparous women had a smaller percentage of epithelium (\u03b2 = -\u20090.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] -\u20090.41, -\u20090.11) and fat (\u03b2 = -\u20090.34, 95% CI -\u20090.54, -\u20090.13) and a greater percentage of stroma (\u03b2 = 0.04, 95% CI 0.01, 0.08). Among parous women, the number of children was inversely associated with the percentage of stroma (\u03b2 per child = -\u20090.01, 95% CI -\u20090.02, -\u20090.00). The duration of breastfeeding of \u2265 24\u2009months was associated with a reduced proportion of fat (\u03b2 = -\u20090.30, 95% CI -\u20090.54, -\u20090.06; p-trend = 0.04). In a separate analysis restricted to premenopausal women, older age at first birth was associated with a greater proportion of epithelium and a smaller proportion of stroma.Our findings suggest that being nulliparous as well as having a fewer number of children (both positively associated with breast cancer risk) is associated with a smaller proportion of epithelium and a greater proportion of stroma, potentially suggesting the importance of epithelial-stromal interactions. Future studies are warranted to confirm our findings and to elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms.",
  "It is unclear as to whether Wilms' tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP) promotes or suppresses breast cancer. This immunohistochemistry analysis explored levels of WTAP expression in 347 cases of breast cancer and analyzed the relationship between WTAP expression and the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of breast cancer patients. The rate of high WTAP expression was significantly higher in breast cancer tissue than in adjacent normal breast tissue (37.5% vs 0.0%; P\u2009<\u20090.001). WTAP expression was positively associated with tumor size and grade, and negatively associated with axillary lymph node metastasis, estrogen and progesterone receptor status. Rates of high WTAP expression were 66.1% in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tissue and 31.3% in non-TNBC tissue. In multiple logistic regression analysis, independent predictors of WTAP expression in breast cancer included larger tumor size (odds ratio\u2009=\u20091.907; 95% confidence interval: 1.185-3.067; P\u2009=\u20090.008), lymph node metastasis (0.597; 0.373-0.956; P\u2009=\u20090.032) and TNBC status (3.735; 2.056-6.784; P\u2009<\u20090.001). No clear relationship was observed between patient prognosis and WTAP expression. We suggest that WTAP expression is upregulated in breast cancer and appears to both promote tumor growth and inhibit lymph node metastasis.",
  "One-third of patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancers fail to respond to hormone therapy, and some patients even progress within two years of adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) toward primary endocrine resistance. However, there is no effective way to predict endocrine resistance.To build a model that incorporates the radiomic signature of pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with clinical information to predict endocrine resistance.Clinical data of non-metastatic breast cancer patients diagnosed between May 1, 2015 and December 31, 2018 and preoperative dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) were retrospectively collected from three hospitals in China. The significant clinicopathological characteristics and radiomic signatures were included in multivariable logistic regression to establish a combined model to predict endocrine resistance in the training set, and validate the internal and external validation set.A total of 744 female non-metastatic breast cancer patients from three hospitals in China were included. In the training cohort, the AUC of the Radiomic-Clinical combined model to predict endocrine resistance was 0.975, which was higher than clinical model (0.849), IHC4 model (0.682) and similar as radiomic model (0.941). Also, the AUC of the combined model in the internal (0.921) and external validation cohort (0.955) were higher than clinical model and IHC4 model. The sensitivity of combined model was higher than radiomic alone, and got the best thresholding of the AUC.This study developed and validated a pretreatment multiparametric MRI-based radiomic-clinical combined model and showed good performance in predicting endocrine resistance.",
  "Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and is the leading cause of cancer-associated mortality in women worldwide. Intermedin (IMD, also known as Adrenomedullin 2, ADM2) is an endogenous peptide that belongs to the calcitonin gene-related peptide family and has been reported to play important roles in several types of cancers, including breast cancer. In this study, we sought to investigate how IMD affects the behavior of breast cancer cells, the underlying mechanism of these effects, and whether blockade of IMD has a therapeutic effect against breast cancer.Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq), cell biological experiments, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and animal tumor models were used.IMD expression was significantly increased in breast cancer samples, and the IMD level was positively correlated with lymph node metastasis and Ki67 expression. Cell biological experiments showed that IMD promoted the anchorage-independent growth, migration, and invasive ability of breast cancer cells. Inhibiting IMD activity with an anti-IMD monoclonal antibody blocked these tumor-promoting effects. In addition, blockade of IMD reduced in situ tumor growth and significantly decreased lung metastasis of 4T1 breast cancer in vivo. IMD induced Src kinase phosphorylation, which triggered the transcription of c-Myc, a major oncoprotein controlling the expression of genes that encode ribosomal components. Our data suggest that IMD is involved in breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis, potentially through increasing ribosome biogenesis and protein translation via the Src/c-Myc signaling pathway.These results suggest that IMD may be a novel target for the treatment of breast cancer.",
  "Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disorder with different molecular subtypes and biological characteristics for which there are diverse therapeutic approaches and clinical outcomes specific to any molecular subtype. It is a global health concern due to a lack of efficient therapy regimens that might be used for all disease subtypes. Therefore, treatment customization for each patient depending on molecular characteristics should be considered. Precision medicine for breast cancer is an approach to diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of the disease that takes into consideration the patient's genetic makeup. Precision medicine provides the promise of highly individualized treatment, in which each individual breast cancer patient receives the most appropriate diagnostics and targeted therapies based on the genetic profile of cancer. The knowledge about the molecular features and development of breast cancer treatment approaches has increased, which led to the development of new targeted therapeutics. Tumor genomic profiling is the standard of care for breast cancer that could contribute to taking steps to better management of malignancies. It holds great promise for accurate prognostication, prediction of response to common systemic therapies, and individualized monitoring of the disease. The emergence of targeted treatment has significantly enhanced the survival of patients with breast cancer and contributed to reducing the economic costs of the health system. In this review, we summarized the therapeutic approaches associated with the molecular classification of breast cancer to help the best treatment selection specific to the target patient.",
  "To support shared decision-making, patient-facing resources are needed to complement recently published guidelines on approaches for surveillance mammography in breast cancer survivors aged \u2265\u200975 or with\u2009<\u200910-year life expectancy. We created a patient guide to facilitate discussions about surveillance mammography in older breast cancer survivors.The \"Are Mammograms Still Right for Me?\" guide estimates future ipsilateral and contralateral breast (in-breast) cancer risks, general health, and the potential benefits/harms of mammography, with prompts for discussion. We conducted in-clinic acceptability testing of the guide by survivors and their clinicians at a National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center, including two community practices. Patients and clinicians received the guide ahead of a clinic visit and surveyed patients (pre-/post-visit) and clinicians (post-visit). Acceptability was defined as \u2265\u200975% of patients and clinicians reporting that the guide (a) should be recommended to others, (b) is clear, (c) is helpful, and (d) contains a suitable amount of information. We also elicited feedback on usability and mammography intentions.We enrolled 45 patients and their 21 clinicians. Among those responding in post-visit surveys, 33/37 (89%) patients and 15/16 (94%) clinicians would recommend the guide to others; 33/37 (89%) patients and 15/16 (94%) clinicians felt everything/most things were clear. All other pre-specified acceptability criteria were met. Most patients reported strong intentions for mammography (100% pre-visit, 98% post-visit).Oncology clinicians and older breast cancer survivors found a guide to inform mammography decision-making acceptable and clear. A multisite clinical trial is needed to assess the guide's impact mammography utilization.ClinicalTrials.gov-NCT03865654, posted March 7, 2019.",
  "Evidence of cardiotoxicity risk related to anthracycline or trastuzumab exposure is largely derived from breast cancer cohorts that under-represent socioeconomically marginalized women, who may be at increased risk of cardiotoxicity because of high prevalence of cardiovascular disease risk factors. Therefore, we aimed to estimate cardiotoxicity risk among socioeconomically marginalized breast cancer patients treated with anthracyclines or trastuzumab and describe clinical consequences of cardiotoxicity.We linked electronic health records with institutional registry data from a Comprehensive Community Cancer Program within a safety-net health system. Eligible patients were adult females, diagnosed with first primary invasive breast cancer between 2013 and 2017, and initiated anthracyclines or trastuzumab as part of first-line therapy. We estimated cumulative incidence (risk) of cardiotoxicity with corresponding 95% confidence limits (CL) using the Aalen-Johansen estimator with death as competing risk.Our study population comprised 169 women with breast cancer (103 initiated anthracyclines and 66 initiated trastuzumab). Cumulative incidence of cardiotoxicity was 21% (95% CL: 12%, 32%) at one year and 25% (95% CL: 15%, 35%) at three years among women who initiated trastuzumab, whereas cumulative incidence was 3.9% (95% CL: 1.3%, 8.9%) at one year and 5.9% (95% CL: 2.4%, 12%) at three years among women who initiated anthracyclines. More than half of patients with cardiotoxicity experienced interruption of cancer treatment.Our findings suggest high risk of cardiotoxicity among socioeconomically marginalized breast cancer patients after initiation of anthracyclines or trastuzumab. Strategies are needed for optimizing cancer treatment effectiveness while minimizing cardiotoxicity in this population.",
  "Breast cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in women. Five subtypes of breast cancer differ in their genetic expression profiles and carry different prognostic values, with no treatments available for some types, such as triple-negative, due to the absence of genetic signatures that could otherwise be targeted by molecular therapies. Although endocrine treatments are largely successful for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive cancers, a significant proportion of patients with metastatic tumors fail to respond and acquire resistance to therapy. FOXA1 overexpression mediates endocrine therapy resistance in ER-positive breast cancer, although the regulation of chemotherapy response by FOXA1 has not been addressed previously. FOXA1, together with EP300 and RUNX1, regulates the expression of E-cadherin, and is expressed in luminal, but absent in triple-negative and basal-like breast cancers. We have previously determined that EP300 regulates drug resistance and tumor initiation capabilities in breast cancer cells.Here we describe the generation of breast cancer cell models in which FOXA1 expression has been modulated either by expression of hairpins targeting FOXA1 mRNA or overexpression plasmids.Upon FOXA1 knockdown in luminal MCF-7 and T47D cells, we found an increase in doxorubicin and paclitaxel sensitivity as well as a decrease in anchorage independence. Conversely, upregulation of FOXA1 in basal-like MDA-MB-231 cells led to an increase in drug resistance and anchorage independence.Together, these data suggest that FOXA1 plays a role in making tumors more aggressive.",
  "Locally advanced breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with respect to response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and survival. It is currently not possible to accurately predict who will benefit from the specific types of NACT. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism known to play an important role in regulating gene expression and may serve as a biomarker for treatment response and survival. We investigated the potential role of DNA methylation as a prognostic marker for long-term survival (>\u20095\u00a0years) after NACT in breast cancer.DNA methylation profiles of pre-treatment (n\u2009=\u200955) and post-treatment (n\u2009=\u200975) biopsies from 83 women with locally advanced breast cancer were investigated using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. The patients received neoadjuvant treatment with epirubicin and/or paclitaxel. Linear mixed models were used to associate DNA methylation to treatment response and survival based on clinical response to NACT (partial response or stable disease) and 5-year survival, respectively. LASSO regression was performed to identify a risk score based on the statistically significant methylation sites and Kaplan-Meier curve analysis was used to estimate survival probabilities using ten years of survival follow-up data. The risk score developed in our discovery cohort was validated in an independent validation cohort consisting of paired pre-treatment and post-treatment biopsies from 85 women with locally advanced breast cancer. Patients included in the validation cohort were treated with either doxorubicin or 5-FU and mitomycin NACT.DNA methylation patterns changed from before to after NACT in 5-year survivors, while no significant changes were observed in non-survivors or related to\u00a0treatment response. DNA methylation changes included an overall loss of methylation at CpG islands and gain of methylation in non-CpG islands, and these changes affected genes linked to transcription factor activity, cell adhesion and immune functions. A risk score was developed based on four methylation sites which successfully predicted long-term survival in our cohort (p\u2009=\u20090.0034) and in an independent validation cohort (p\u2009=\u20090.049).Our results demonstrate that DNA methylation patterns in breast tumors change in response to NACT. These changes in DNA methylation show potential as prognostic biomarkers for breast cancer survival.",
  "For a long time, breast cancer has been a leading cancer diagnosed in women worldwide, and approximately 90% of cancer-related deaths are caused by metastasis. For this reason, finding new biomarkers related to metastasis is an urgent task to predict the metastatic status of breast cancer and provide new therapeutic targets.In this research, an efficient model of eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) optimized by a grid search algorithm is established to realize auxiliary identification of metastatic breast tumors based on gene expression. Estimated by ten-fold cross-validation, the optimized XGBoost classifier can achieve an overall higher mean AUC of 0.82 compared to other classifiers such as DT, SVM, KNN, LR, and RF.A novel 6-gene signature (SQSTM1, GDF9, LINC01125, PTGS2, GVINP1, and TMEM64) was selected by feature importance ranking and a series of in vitro experiments were conducted to verify the potential role of each biomarker. In general, the effects of SQSTM in tumor cells are assigned as a risk factor, while the effects of the other 5 genes (GDF9, LINC01125, PTGS2, GVINP1, and TMEM64) in immune cells are assigned as protective factors.Our findings will allow for a more accurate prediction of the metastatic status of breast cancer and will benefit the mining of breast cancer metastasis-related biomarkers.",
  "<b>Background:</b> Statins treat hyperlipidemia and prevent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Evidence suggests that they also have anti-neoplastic activity. Several studies show a reduced rate of breast cancer recurrence among lipophilic statin users (<i>e.g.</i>, simvastatin), motivating calls for clinical trials of statins in breast cancer patients. We measured the impact of genetic variation in statin-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters on the recurrence rate in simvastatin-treated breast cancer patients.<b>Methods:</b> We conducted a nested case-control study among Danish women diagnosed with non-metastatic, invasive breast cancer between 2004-2010 who had filled \u22651 prescription for simvastatin after diagnosis. Cases were all breast cancer recurrences from the source population; one control was matched to each case on cancer stage, estrogen receptor and hormone therapy status, calendar period of diagnosis, and duration of simvastatin exposure. We genotyped variants in simvastatin-metabolizing enzymes (<i>CYP3A4/</i>rs35599367 and <i>CYP3A5/</i>rs776746) and drug transporters (<i>ABCB1/</i>rs2032582 and <i>SLCO1B1/</i>rs4149056), and estimated their association with recurrence with logistic regression models.<b>Results:</b> We observed protective (though imprecisely-measured) associations between variants in genes encoding drug transporters (<i>ABCB1</i> and <i>SLCO1B1</i>) and simvastatin-metabolizing enzymes (<i>CYP3A4</i> and <i>CYP3A5</i>) and breast cancer recurrence in simvastatin-treated women. For example, carrying two variant alleles in <i>ABCB1</i> was associated with a 31% lower rate of recurrence (multivariable OR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.31, 1.5).<b>Conclusion:</b> Our study provides weak evidence to support the use of genetic variation in ABCB1, SLCO1B1, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 as biomarkers of breast tumor response to simvastatin. Validation of these findings within adjuvant clinical trials is encouraged.",
  "A number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in EebB4 gene have been studied, which has clarified their impact on breast cancer in different populations. Nevertheless, the importance of rs13423759 in breast cancer has not been studied and its effect remained almost unclear. In this paper, we evaluated the frequency of rs13423759 different alleles in Iranian population and statistically analyzed their association with breast cancer risk.Allele-specific Primer PCR (ASP-PCR) was recruited in this study to genotype rs13423759 position in 172 breast cancer and 148 healthy control subjects. The genotypes of control and cases were analyzed statistically to find the association between rs13423759 alleles and breast cancer incidence and its clinicopathological characteristics. In silico studies were performed in order to find the mechanistic viewpoint of rs13423759 alleles in breast cancer.rs13423759 allele C was shown to be significantly associated with breast cancer risk, HER2 positivity and increased risk of metastasis. Reciprocally, allele A was correlated with the lowered risk of breast cancer. The in silico studies showed that rs13423759 allele C is capable to strengthen the interaction between miR-548as, an oncomiRNA, and ErbB4 mRNA, leading to its lowered concentration in the cells.rs13423759 allele C is significantly associated with the enhanced risk of breast cancer, elevated metastasis and HER2 positivity.",
  "Overseas, the importance for breast MRI screening for high-risk groups has been shown. However, the evidence among Japanese population was lacking. Therefore, we collaborated with the \"Study on clinical and genetic characterization of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and improvement in prognosis using genetic information in Japan\" group, as part of the Comprehensive Research Project on the Promotion of Cancer Control, Health and Labour Sciences Research, and have been conducting the study entitled, \"Study of the usefulness of MRI surveillance of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers\" since 2014. In addition, we found that in the Japanese population also, the pathological and imaging characteristics differ between BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, like in non-Japanese populations by the several reports. In high-risk females, risk categories such as BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers are very important. Furthermore, in the future, the optimal surveillance modalities and examination intervals would also vary according to the age, thinness of the breast (constitution), breast density (individual differences on mammography), etc.; this would be \"personalized surveillance\", and quality-assured MRI examination is of the essence. This review will present clinical trial data of prospective MRI surveillance in Japan, and summarize the current status of breast cancer screening in high-risk Japanese women.",
  "Women with history of chest irradiation for Hodgkin lymphoma are at increased risk of developing bilateral breast cancer, although contralateral breast cancer risk estimates in this population remain undefined.We queried the SEER database for women treated with radiation therapy for Hodgkin lymphoma prior to age 30 years and were diagnosed with a subsequent breast cancer between 1990-2016. Trends in surgical management and the 5- and 10-year cumulative incidence of contralateral breast cancer were evaluated.The cohort included 295 women with a median age of 22 years (range 8-30 years) at Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis, and 42 years (range 22-65 years) at breast cancer diagnosis. Overall, 263 (89.2%) presented with unilateral breast cancer, while 32 (10.8%) presented with synchronous bilateral breast cancer. Breast-conserving surgery was performed in 17.3% of patients, while mastectomy was performed in 82.7%. In 263 patients presenting with unilateral breast cancer, 50 (19.0%) underwent breast-conserving surgery and 213 (81.0%) underwent mastectomy. Subgroup analysis of mastectomy patients demonstrated a 40.5% bilateral mastectomy rate. The 5-year incidence of contralateral breast cancer in women who underwent unilateral surgery was 9.4% [95% confidence interval (CI), 5.6-15.4%], increasing to 20.2% (95% CI, 13.7-29.2%) at 10-year and 29.9% (95% CI, 20.8-41.9%) at 15-year follow-up.Women with a history of prior chest radiation for Hodgkin lymphoma with a diagnosis of breast cancer have a 10-year contralateral breast cancer risk of 20%. These findings support consideration of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy during surgical decision-making for management of this high-risk patient population.",
  "To review and discuss the rationale behind performing baseline 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography imaging for staging of inflammatory breast cancer patients.In the past three decades, the epidemiology of inflammatory breast cancer has resulted in separation of this entity from other breast cancer in staging and treatment. Advances in cancer imaging from 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography to 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography have now allowed for anatomic and functional correlation in evaluating extent of disease in cancer patients. Furthermore, studies throughout the past two decades have highlighted how 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography may play a role in staging inflammatory breast cancer patients given the uniqueness of this entity when compared to other breast cancers.Narrative overview of the literature summarizing findings in the literature from searches in computerized databases and authoritative texts. The use of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography with respect to regional nodal staging and distant metastasis detection in inflammatory breast cancer patients is reviewed. In addition, an overview of studies conducted to date comparing the sensitivity and specificity of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography for baseline staging in inflammatory breast cancer patients is also provided. Therapeutic influences and effect on overall survival is discussed.Baseline 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography allows for more optimal nodal staging, which has implications in prognosis and treatment of inflammatory breast cancer patients. It also allows for improved detection of metastasis on baseline presentation allowing therapy to potentially target these additional sites of disease.",
  "Although the antitumor efficacy of docetaxel (DTX) has long been attributed to the antimitotic activities, its impact on the tumor microenvironment (TME) has recently gained more attention. Macrophages are a major component of the TME and play a critical role in DTX efficacy; however, the underlying action mechanisms remain unclear.DTX chemotherapeutic efficacy was demonstrated via both macrophage depletion and C-C motif chemokine ligand 3 (Ccl3)-knockout transgenic allograft mouse model. Ccl3-knockdown and Ccl3-overexpressing breast cancer cell allografts were used for the in vivo study. Combination therapy was used to evaluate the effect of Ccl3 induction on DTX chemosensitivity. Vital regulatory molecules and pathways were identified using RNA sequencing. Macrophage phagocytosis of cancer cells and its influence on cancer cell proliferation under DTX treatment were assessed using an in vitro coculture assay. Serum and tumor samples from patients with breast cancer were used to demonstrate the clinical relevance of our study.Our study revealed that Ccl3 induced by DTX in macrophages and cancer cells was indispensable for the chemotherapeutic efficacy of DTX. DTX-induced Ccl3 promoted proinflammatory macrophage polarization and subsequently facilitated phagocytosis of breast cancer cells and cancer stem cells. Ccl3 overexpression in cancer cells promoted proinflammatory macrophage polarization to suppress tumor progression and increase DTX chemosensitivity. Mechanistically, DTX induced Ccl3 by relieving the inhibition of cAMP-response element binding protein on Ccl3 via reactive oxygen species accumulation, and Ccl3 then promoted proinflammatory macrophage polarization via activation of the Ccl3-C-C motif chemokine receptor 5-p38/interferon regulatory factor 5 pathway. High CCL3 expression predicted better prognosis, and high CCL3 induction revealed better DTX chemosensitivity in patients with breast cancer. Furthermore, both the Creb inhibitor and recombinant mouse Ccl3 significantly enhanced DTX chemosensitivity.Our results indicate that Ccl3 induced by DTX triggers proinflammatory macrophage polarization and subsequently facilitates phagocytosis of cancer cells. Ccl3 induction in combination with DTX may provide a promising therapeutic rationale for increasing DTX chemosensitivity in breast cancer.",
  "Breast cancer has become the most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide. Increasing evidence indicated that zinc finger proteins (ZNFs), the largest family of transcription factors, contribute to cancer development and progression. Although ZNF384 is overexpressed in several types of human cancer, the role of ZNF384 in breast cancer remains unknown. Therefore, our research focused on ZNF384 regulation of the malignant phenotype of breast cancer and the underlying molecular mechanisms.CCK-8 and colony formation assays were used to evaluate cell proliferation. Transwell and scratch assays were used to evaluate the cell migration and invasion. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR and luciferase reporter assays were used to confirm the target relationship between ZNF384 and zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1). Xenografts were used to monitor the targets in vivo effects.We noted that ZNF384 was significantly overexpressed in breast cancer and highlighted the oncogenic mechanism of ZNF384. ZNF384 transactivated ZEB1 expression and induced an epithelial and mesenchymal-like phenotype, resulting in breast cancer metastasis. Furthermore, ZNF384 may be a target of miR-485-5p, and ZEB1 can up-regulate ZNF384 expression by repressing miR-485-5p expression. Together, we unveiled a feedback loop of ZNF384-ZEB1 in breast cancer metastasis.The findings suggest that ZNF384 can serve as a prognostic factor and a therapeutic target for breast cancer patients.",
  "Dual blockade with trastuzumab and pertuzumab combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) has been increasingly used for HER2-positive tumours >2\u00a0cm and/or with positive axillary lymph nodes in order to evaluate pathologic response and obtain better surgical management. SB3 is a registered biosimilar trastuzumab approved following a phase III trial demonstrating similar efficacy in the neoadjuvant setting as trastuzumab. However, the study was done without pertuzumab.The database of the Danish Breast Cancer Group was used to extract data on all patients who started NACT with SB3 and pertuzumab between September 1, 2018 and August 31, 2019. The primary endpoint was pathological complete response (pCR) rate.In total 215 patients received NACT and dual blockade. The median age was 55 (24-81). NACT used was cyclophosphamide and epirubicin followed by weekly paclitaxel (62% on six cycles, 35% on eight cycles) or other chemotherapy followed by weekly paclitaxel (3%). Overall, 56% of patients achieved pCR. 60 of 88 node-positive patients pre-NACT achieved ypN0(i-) after neoadjuvant treatment. pCR rate was significantly associated with estrogen receptor status and malignancy grade. An association with CEP17/HER2-ratio was assessed.Real world data on dual blockade with SB3 and pertuzumab in combination with NACT in a nationwide population-based study show a pCR rate comparable to that seen in previous clinical studies.",
  "<b>OBJECTIVE.</b> Our previous work showed that variation measures, which represent breast architecture derived from mammograms, were significantly associated with breast cancer. For replication purposes, we examined the association of three variation measures (variation [V], which is measured in the image domain, and P<sub>1</sub> and p<sub>1</sub> [a normalized version of P<sub>1</sub>], which are derived from restricted regions in the Fourier domain) with breast cancer risk in an independent population. We also compared these measures to volumetric density measures (volumetric percent density [VPD] and dense volume [DV]) from a commercial product. <b>MATERIALS AND METHODS.</b> We examined 514 patients with breast cancer and 1377 control patients from a screening practice who were matched for age, date of examination, mammography unit, facility, and state of residence. Spearman rank-order correlation was used to evaluate the monotonic association between measures. Breast cancer associations were estimated using conditional logistic regression, after adjustment for age and body mass index. Odds ratios were calculated per SD increment in mammographic measure. <b>RESULTS.</b> These variation measures were strongly correlated with VPD (correlation, 0.68-0.80) but not with DV (correlation, 0.31-0.48). Similar to previous findings, all variation measures were significantly associated with breast cancer (odds ratio per SD: 1.30 [95% CI, 1.16-1.46] for V, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.35-1.77] for P<sub>1</sub>, and 1.51 [95% CI, 1.33-1.72] for p<sub>1</sub>). Associations of volumetric density measures with breast cancer were similar (odds ratio per SD: 1.54 [95% CI, 1.33-1.78] for VPD and 1.34 [95% CI, 1.20-1.50] for DV). When DV was included with each variation measure in the same model, all measures retained significance. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> Variation measures were significantly associated with breast cancer risk (comparable to the volumetric density measures) but were independent of the DV.",
  "We evaluated whether a novel, fully automated convolutional neural network (CNN)-based mammographic evaluation can predict breast cancer relapse among women with operable hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer.We conducted a retrospective cohort study among women with stage I-III, HR-positive unilateral breast cancer diagnosed at Columbia University Medical Center from 2007 to 2017, who received adjuvant endocrine therapy and had at least two mammograms (baseline, annual follow-up) of the contralateral unaffected breast for CNN analysis. We extracted demographics, clinicopathologic characteristics, breast cancer treatments, and relapse status from the electronic health record. Our primary endpoint was change in CNN risk score (range, 0-1). We used two-sample\u00a0t-tests to assess for difference in mean CNN scores between patients who relapsed vs. remained in remission, and conducted Cox regression analyses to assess for association between change in CNN score and breast cancer-free interval (BCFI), adjusting for known prognostic factors.Among 848 women followed for a median of 59\u00a0months, there were 67 (7.9%) breast cancer relapses (36 distant, 25 local, 6 new primaries). There was a significant difference in mean absolute change in CNN risk score from baseline to 1-year follow-up between those who relapsed vs. remained in remission (0.001 vs. -\u00a00.022, p\u2009=\u20090.030). After adjustment for prognostic factors, a 0.01 absolute increase in CNN score at 1-year was significantly associated with BCFI, hazard ratio\u2009=\u20091.05 (95% Confidence Interval 1.01-1.09, p\u2009=\u20090.011).Short-term change in the CNN-based breast cancer risk model on adjuvant endocrine therapy predicts breast cancer relapse, and warrants further evaluation in prospective studies.",
  "Transgelin-2 is an actin-binding protein that is widely expressed in various tissues and organs of the body, and reportedly may participate in the development and progression of multiple cancers. However, the clinical significance of transgelin-2 still remains controversial. We, therefore, aimed to determine the expression of transgelin-2 in breast cancer as well as its correlation with the tumorigenesis, progression and prognosis of human breast cancer.We collected tissues of 58 breast cancer patients from our hospital and 1090 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. X-tile software was used to divide the transgelin-2 mRNA expression level in the database, logistic regression model was used to identify independent factors influencing transgelin-2 mRNA expression, and then Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to find factors that influence survival of breast cancer.Transgelin-2 was significantly overexpressed in breast cancer tissues from our hospital and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve indicated that transgelin-2 may have diagnostic value. Meanwhile, estrogen receptor (ER) was in inverse correlation with transgelin-2 protein and mRNA expression, and transgelin-2 expression was positively correlated with Ki67 in breast cancer tissues. Logistic regression model revealed that TNM stage, ER and progesterone receptor (PR) status were independent factors for transgelin-2 mRNA expression. Patients with high transgelin-2 mRNA expression showed a poor survival and the trend was statistically significant only in ER-negative patients.Transgelin-2 was expressed significantly higher in breast cancer cells and correlated with some clinicopathological factors. High transgelin-2 expression might predict poor prognosis for ER-negative patients.",
  "Cholesterol-in particular, high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and its metabolite, 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC)-is correlated with increases in the risks of breast cancer and obesity. Although the high expression of LDL/27-OHC has been reported in breast cancer, its effects and mechanism of action remain to be fully elucidated. In this study, we found that the effects of LDL on cell proliferation were mediated by the activation of the cytochrome P450 enzyme, sterol 27 hydroxylase, and cholesterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) in both ER-\u03b1-positive and ER-\u03b1-negative breast cancer cells. We found that treatment with 27-OHC only increased cell growth in oestrogen receptor-\u03b1 (ER-\u03b1)-positive breast cancer cells in an ER-\u03b1-dependent manner, but, interestingly, the effects of 27-OHC on cell migration and invasion were independent of ER-\u03b1. Using ER-\u03b1-negative MDA-MB-231 cells, we found that 27-OHC similarly promoted cell invasion and migration, and this was mediated by oestrogen receptor \u03b2 (ER-\u03b2). These results suggest that 27-OHC promotes breast cancer cell proliferation in ER-\u03b1-positive breast cancer cells via ER-\u03b1, but migration and invasion are mediated via ER-\u03b2 in ER-\u03b1 positive and negative cell lines. The addition of LDL/27OHC increased the production of IGF-I and the abundance of IGF-IR in TNBC. We further found that modulating ER-\u03b2 using an agonist or antagonist increased or decreased, respectively, levels of the IGF-I and EGF receptors in TNBC. The inhibition of the insulin-like growth factor receptor blocked the effects of cholesterol on cell growth and the migration of TNBC. Using TCGA and METABRIC microarray expression data from invasive breast cancer carcinomas, we also observed that higher levels of ER-beta were associated with higher levels of IGF-IR. Thus, this study shows novel evidence that ER-\u03b2 is central to the effects of LDL/27OHC on invasion, migration, and the IGF and EGF axes. Our data suggest that targeting ER-\u03b2 in TNBC could be an alternative approach for downregulating IGF/EGF signalling and controlling the impact of LDL in breast cancer patients.",
  "Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) offers unenhanced method to detect breast cancer without cost and safety concerns associated with dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI. Our purpose was to evaluate the performance of DW-MRI at 3.0T in detection of clinically and mammographically occult contralateral breast cancer in patients with unilateral breast cancer.Between 2017 and 2018, 1130 patients (mean age 53.3\u00a0years; range 26-84\u00a0years) with newly diagnosed unilateral breast cancer who underwent breast MRI and had no abnormalities on clinical and mammographic examinations of contralateral breast were included. Three experienced radiologists independently reviewed DW-MRI (b\u2009=\u20090 and 1000\u00a0s/mm<sup>2</sup>) and DCE-MRI and assigned a BI-RADS category. Using histopathology or 1-year clinical follow-up, performance measures of DW-MRI were compared with DCE-MRI.A total of 21 (1.9%, 21/1130) cancers were identified (12 ductal carcinoma in situ and 9 invasive ductal carcinoma; mean invasive tumor size, 8.0\u00a0mm) in the contralateral breast. Cancer detection rate of DW-MRI was 13-15 with mean of 14 per 1000 examinations (95% confidence interval [CI] 9-23 per 1000 examinations), which was lower than that of DCE-MRI (18-19 with mean of 18 per 1000 examinations, P\u2009=\u20090.01). A lower abnormal interpretation rate (14.0% versus 17.0%, respectively, P\u2009<\u20090.001) with higher specificity (87.3% versus 84.6%, respectively, P\u2009<\u20090.001) but lower sensitivity (77.8% versus 96.8%, respectively, P\u2009<\u20090.001) was noted for DW-MRI compared to DCE-MRI.DW-MRI at 3.0T has the potential as a cost-effective tool for evaluation of contralateral breast in women with newly diagnosed breast cancer.",
  "Hormone Therapy (HT) is recommended for most women with HR-positive primary breast cancer. When taken as intended, HT reduces breast cancer recurrence by 40% and mortality by one-third. The recommended duration of treatment ranges from 5 to 10 years depending on risk of recurrence and the specific HT regimen. However, recent data indicates that rates of HT non-adherence are high and research suggests this may be due to the impact of HT side effects. The contribution of side effects to non-adherence and non-persistence behaviours has rarely been systematically explored, thereby hindering the implementation of targeted intervention strategies. Our aim is to identify, evaluate and summarise the relationship between HT side effects and patterns of adherence and persistence.Electronic searches were conducted from inception and were completed by September 2021, utilising Cochrane CENTRAL, Medline, Embase, Web of Science and PsycINFO databases. Searches included a combination of terms related to breast cancer, adherence, hormone therapy and side effects.Sixty-two eligible papers were identified and study quality varied by study type. Most observational and cross-sectional studies were rated good quality, whereas most controlled intervention studies were rated fair quality. Three studies were rated poor quality. The most frequently measured side effects were pain, low mood, hot flashes, insomnia, anxiety, fatigue, weight gain, concentration/memory problems.This review identified a lack of consistency in the measurement of adherence and the definition of persistence across studies. The instruments used to measure side effects also varied significantly. This variation and lack of consistency makes it difficult to evaluate and summarise the role of HT side effects in HT adherence and persistence behaviour.",
  "Primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (pSS) and breast cancer are a highly prevalent autoimmune disease and malignancy, respectively, both occurring predominantly in females. Whether there is a link between these two diseases is uncertain. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the risk, incidence, and mortality of breast cancer in patients with pSS.We systematically searched Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science on January 31, 2022 to identify the study that assessed risk, incidence, or mortality of breast cancer in pSS. The fixed or random-effects models were applied to pool the effect estimates based on heterogeneity measured by Cochran's Q-test and Higgins' I<sup>2</sup>.Ten studies involving 725,805 participants and 64,836 pSS patients were included in our analysis. The pooled result showed that, overall, pSS was not associated with the risk (SIR=0.92, 95%CI: 0.66-1.29, <i>P</i>=0.646) and mortality (HR = 0.78, 95%CI: 0.26-2.34, <i>P</i> = 0.664) of breast cancer; however, when stratified by geographic region, we found that patients with pSS in Asian countries (SIR=1.32, 95%CI: 1.10-1.58, <i>P</i>=0.003) and Argentina (SIR=3.76, 95%CI: 1.04-9.45, <i>P</i>=0.019) had an elevated risk of breast cancer, while pSS in Europe was associated with a reduced risk (SIR=0.61, 95%CI: 0.51-0.73, <i>P</i><0.001). The pooled result from 28,635 female pSS patients indicated that the incidence of breast cancer was 2.15 (95% CI: 1.33-3.50) per 1000 person/years.This study suggests that there may be geographical differences in the association between pSS and breast cancer risk; patients with pSS in European countries are associated with a lower risk of breast cancer, while Asia and Argentina are the opposite. Future research is needed to further characterize the effect of pSS on breast cancer risk and the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this association to unravel the complex relationship between the two.",
  "The stemness of cancer cells contributes to tumorigenesis, the heterogeneity of malignancies, cancer metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. However, the roles and regulatory mechanisms maintaining stemness among breast cancer subtypes remain elusive. Our previous studies have demonstrated that ectopic expression and dynamic alteration of the mesenchymal transcription factor forkhead box F2 (FOXF2) differentially regulates breast cancer progression and metastasis organotropism in a cell subtype-specific manner. Here, we reveal the underlying mechanism by which FOXF2 enhances stemness in luminal breast cancer cells but suppresses that in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) cells. We show that luminal breast cancer and BLBC cells with FOXF2-regulated stemness exhibit partial mesenchymal stem cell properties that toward osteogenic differentiation and myogenic differentiation, respectively. Furthermore, we show that FOXF2 activates the Wnt signaling pathway in luminal breast cancer cells but represses this pathway in BLBC cells by recruiting nuclear receptor coactivator 3 (NCoA3) and nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCoR1) to the promoters of Wnt family member 2B (WNT2B) and frizzled class receptor 1 (FZD1) genes to activate and repress their transcription, respectively. We propose that targeting the Wnt signaling pathway is a promising strategy for the treatment of breast cancers with dysregulated expression of FOXF2.",
  "More than one third of breast cancer patients including those that are diagnosed in early stages will develop distant metastasis. Patterns of distant metastasis and the associated risks according to the molecular subtypes are not completely revealed particularly in populations of patients with delayed diagnosis and advanced stages.Breast cancer patients (n = 1304) admitted to our institute (2014-2017) were evaluated to identify the metastatic patterns and the associated risks. Metastatic breast cancers at diagnosis were found in 245 patients (18.7%), and 1059 patients were then grouped into non-metastatic and metastatic groups after a median follow-up of 3.8\u2009years.Infiltration of the tumor to the skin and chest wall prevailed as the most powerful predictor for distant metastasis (OR 2.115, 95% CI 1.544-2.898) particularly in the luminal A-like subtype (OR 2.685, 95% CI 1.649-4.371). Nodal involvement was also significantly associated with the risk of distant metastasis (OR 1.855, 95% CI 1.319-2.611), and the risk was higher in the Luminal A-like subtype (OR 2.572, 95% CI 1.547-4.278). Luminal A-like subtype had a significant higher risk of bone metastasis (OR 1.601, 95% CI 1.106-2.358). In respect to treatment, a combination of anthracyclines and taxanes-based chemotherapy was significantly associated with lower distant organ spread in comparison with anthracycline-based chemotherapy (OR 0.510, 95% CI 0.355-0.766) and the effect was stronger in Luminal A-like subtype (OR 0.417, 95% CI 0.226-0.769). Classification into Luminal and non-Luminal subtypes revealed significant higher risks of bone metastasis in the Luminal subtype (OR 1.793, 95% CI 1.209-2.660) and pulmonary metastasis in non-Luminal breast cancer (OR 1.445, 95% CI 1.003-2.083).In addition to guiding the treatment plan, a comprehensive analysis of clinicopathological variables including the molecular subtypes could assist in the determination of distant metastasis risks of breast cancer patients. Our study offers new perspectives concerning the risks of distant metastasis in breast cancer subtypes in order to plan intensive surveillance or escalation of treatment particularly in a setting where patients are predominantly diagnosed in late stages.",
  "Breast cancer treatment can have a considerable large and prolonged impact on activity levels of breast cancer survivors. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the change in total physical activity level and occupational, sport and household activity levels of breast cancer survivors from preoperatively up to 24 months after breast cancer surgery. Additionally, predictive factors for this change were investigated.Patients with primary breast cancer (n\u202f=\u202f267) filled in the Flemish Physical Activity Computerized Questionnaire (FPACQ) before surgery and 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery. Patient-, disease- and treatment-related factors were analyzed as predictive factors for change in physical activity.Two years after surgery, all activity levels (total, occupational, sport and household) were still significantly lower compared to preoperative values. After the first 12 months, no significant improvements were seen for none of the activity levels, except for the occupational activity.Two years after breast cancer surgery, physical activity levels are still significantly lower compared to pre-operative values. Based on this limited recovery, it seems important to monitor physical activity levels in breast cancer patients and advice these patients to stay active after surgery and return to pre-operative activity levels in the long term as well. This study indicates the importance of long term monitoring and subsequently coaching of physical activity after breast cancer surgery.",
  "Immunotherapy is a rapidly evolving treatment option in breast cancer; However, the breast cancer immune microenvironment is understudied in Black and younger (<50 years) patients.We used histologic and RNA-based immunoprofiling methods to characterize the breast cancer immune landscape in 1,952 tumors from the Carolina Breast Cancer Study (CBCS), a population-based study that oversampled Black (n = 1,030) and young women (n = 1,039). We evaluated immune response leveraging markers for 10 immune cell populations, compared profiles to those in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Project [n = 1,095 tumors, Black (n = 183), and young women (n = 295)], and evaluated in association with clinical and demographic variables, including recurrence.Consensus clustering identified three immune clusters in CBCS (adaptive-enriched, innate-enriched, or immune-quiet) that varied in frequency by race, age, tumor grade and subtype; however, only two clusters were identified in TCGA, which were predominantly comprised of adaptive-enriched and innate-enriched tumors. In CBCS, the strongest adaptive immune response was observed for basal-like, HER2-positive (HER2+), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and high-grade tumors. Younger patients had higher proportions of adaptive-enriched tumors, particularly among estrogen receptor (ER)-negative (ER-) cases. Black patients had higher frequencies of both adaptive-enriched and innate-enriched tumors. Immune clusters were associated with recurrence among ER- tumors, with adaptive-enriched showing the best and innate-enriched showing the poorest 5-year recurrence-free survival.These data suggest that immune microenvironments are intricately related to race, age, tumor subtype, and grade.Given higher mortality among Black and young women, more defined immune classification using cell-type-specific panels could help explain higher recurrence and ultimately lead to targetable interventions.",
  "Polygenic risk scores (PRS) for disease risk stratification show great promise for application in general populations, but most are based on data from individuals of White European origin. We assessed two well validated PRS (SNP18, SNP143) in the Predicting-Risk-of-Cancer-At-Screening (PROCAS) study in North-West England for breast cancer prediction based on ethnicity. Overall, 9475 women without breast cancer at study entry, including 645 who subsequently developed invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ provided DNA. All were genotyped for SNP18 and a subset of 1868 controls were genotyped for SNP143. For White Europeans both PRS discriminated well between individuals with and without cancer. For n\u00a0=\u00a0395 Black (n\u00a0=\u00a0112), Asian (n\u00a0=\u00a0119), mixed (n\u00a0=\u00a044) or Jewish (n\u00a0=\u00a0120) women without cancer both PRS overestimated breast cancer risk, being most marked for women of Black and Jewish origin (P\u00a0<\u2009.001). SNP143 resulted in a potential mean 40% breast cancer risk overestimation in the combined group of non-White/non-European origin. SNP-PRS that has been normalized based on White European ethnicity for breast cancer should not be used to predict risk in women of other ethnicities. There is an urgent need to develop PRS specific for other ethnicities, in order to widen access of this technology.",
  "Co-expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) and hormone receptor (HR) predicted worse prognosis in early breast cancer before trastuzumab was developed. We aimed to investigate whether HER2 positivity was still associated with worse outcome in high-risk estrogen receptor (ER) positive patients treated with trastuzumab and chemotherapy. In the present study, 227\u00a0ER+/HER2+ patients treated with trastuzumab and chemotherapy (HER2-pos-T group) and 1097\u00a0ER+/HER2-patients treated with chemotherapy alone (HER2-neg group) during 2009 and 2015 were retrospectively enrolled for the comparison of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). At a median follow-up of 59 months, 174 DFS events and 69 deaths were observed. The estimated 5-year DFS rate was 94.2% in the HER2-pos-T group and 87.4% in the HER2-neg group (Log-rank P\u00a0=\u00a00.014). HER2-pos-T group was associated with significantly better DFS in multivariate analysis (HR 0.38, 95% CI: 0.22-0.67, Log-rank P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). The estimated 5-year OS rates for the two groups were 97.2% and 95.7%, respectively (Log-rank P\u00a0=\u00a00.183). In multivariable analysis, patients in the HER2-pos-T group had significantly better OS compared with those in the HER2-neg group (HR 0.40, 95% CI: 0.17-0.95, Log-rank P\u00a0=\u00a00.037). We concluded that high-risk ER+/HER2+ breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy and trastuzumab had superior prognosis compared with ER+/HER2-patients. Therefore, HER2 positivity itself may not be considered as an unfavorable factor for ER\u00a0+\u00a0patients in the era of trastuzumab.",
  "There is a paucity of data on the spectrum and prevalence of pathogenic variants among women of African ancestry in the Northeast region of Brazil.We performed BROCA panel sequencing to identify inherited loss-of-function variants in breast cancer susceptibility genes among 292 Brazilian women referred to a single institution cancer risk assessment program.The study included a convenient cohort of 173 women with invasive breast cancer (cases) and 119 women who were cancer-free at the time of ascertainment. The majority of the women self-reported as African-descended (67% for cases and 90.8% for unaffected volunteers). Thirty-seven pathogenic variants were found in 36 (20.8%) patients. While the spectrum of pathogenic variants was heterogeneous, the majority (70.3%) of the pathogenic variants were detected in high-risk genes BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, and TP53. Pathogenic variants were also found in the ATM, BARD1, BRIP1, FAM175A, FANCM, NBN, and SLX4 genes in 6.4% of the affected women. Four recurrent pathogenic variants were detected in 11 patients of African ancestry. Only one unaffected woman had a pathogenic variant in the RAD51C gene. Different risk assessment models examined performed well in predicting risk of carrying germline loss-of-function variants in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 in breast cancer cases.The high prevalence and heterogenous spectrum of pathogenic variants identified among self-reported African descendants in Northeast Brazil is consistent with studies in other African ancestry populations with a high burden of aggressive young onset breast cancer. It underscores the need to integrate comprehensive cancer risk assessment and genomic testing in the management of newly diagnosed Black women with breast cancer across the African Diaspora, enabling improved cancer control in admixed underserved and understudied populations.",
  "To report the treatment utilization patterns for hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer in urban mainland China (CancerMPact\u00ae).The results presented are from an online survey conducted in September 2019 with 45 physicians treating breast cancer patients from 11 cities in mainland China.Surveyed physicians reported that Stage I HR+/HER2(-) breast cancer patients are often treated with surgery alone (42%), whereas the use of surgery in combination with systemic therapy with or without radiotherapy increases in later stages (Stage II 67%, Stage III 77%). Doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide (AC)-based regimens were the most common in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings in HR+/HER2(-) breast cancer patients, across all stages. In metastatic patients, use of surgery and radiotherapy decreases in favor of utilization of systemic therapy alone. Pre- and post-menopausal metastatic patients were frequently treated with hormone therapy or AC-based regimens in first line. Regardless of the first-line therapy administered, capecitabine-based regimens were commonly used in second line. In third line, chemotherapy regimens containing capecitabine or gemcitabine were given to nearly 40% of HR+/HER2(-) breast cancer patients. There were no standard of care regimens established for fourth or greater lines of treatment. In metastatic HR+/HER2(-) breast cancer, physicians reported 50% objective response rates in first-line settings with a progression-free survival of 16\u00a0months.HR+/HER2(-) breast cancer patients in urban mainland China were prescribed chemotherapy regimens more frequently than CDK4/6 inhibitors. Treatment practices varied, with physicians reporting the use of multiple modalities and treatment regimens for their patients.",
  "Breast cancer is one of the leading cancers among females of Brunei Darussalam. There are four subtypes of breast cancer, including human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) positive breast cancer, which is known to be more aggressive and have a poor prognosis.This study aims to assess the proportion of HER-2 positive cases and the association of HER-2 positivity with patients' epidemiological and clinicopathological factors in Brunei Darussalam.A total of 146 breast cancer cases that were sent for fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2016 were obtained from The Brunei Cancer Centre, Brunei Darussalam. Data analysis was done with regards to age at diagnosis, ethnicity, stage at diagnosis and HER-2 results by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and FISH. Majority of the study population were diagnosed before the age of 50\u2009years and the median age was 52.0\u2009years. 58.2% (n = 85) cases were reported as IHC 3+, followed by 23.3% (n = 34) IHC 2+ cases and 18.5% (n = 27) negative cases. The proportion of true HER-2 positive cases in total by FISH analysis was 34.9% (n = 51). Majority of Stage IV HER-2 positive cases had metastases to the liver or bones.Age at diagnosis is significant in determining HER-2 status of tumours by FISH (P = .045). Tumour size (P\u2009<\u2009.001) and lymph node (P = .006) are significant in metastases of tumours. The proportion of HER-2 positive cases is consistent with findings from the Asian region but higher than that of Western countries. Determining false-positive and false-negative results by IHC test is important to ensure adequate treatment for patients with breast cancer.",
  "Axillary web syndrome (AWS) presents as a common postsurgical complication in individuals with breast cancer. Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) contributes to the shoulder and arm morbidity common in breast cancer survivors and often associated to cancer treatment. A paucity of literature exists evaluating the risk factors for developing AWS and the association between AWS and BCRL. The purposes of this study were (1) to identify risk factors for AWS in individuals with breast cancer, (2) to examine the association between BCRL and AWS, and (3) to determine if AWS increases the risk for developing BCRL.A retrospective study of 354 women who underwent breast cancer treatment and received physical therapy was included.Axillary web syndrome developed in a third of women and predominately occurred in the first 8 postoperative weeks. The odds of AWS development were 73% greater for participants over the age of 60 (OR\u2009=\u20091.73, CI 95% 1.05-2.84). Women with AWS had 44% greater risk to develop lymphedema during the first postoperative year (RR\u2009=\u20091.44, CI 95% 1.12-1.84, p\u2009=\u20090.002). If AWS developed within the first postoperative month, women were almost 3 times more likely to develop lymphedema within the first 3 postoperative months compared with other women with AWS (RR\u2009=\u20092.75, CI 95% 1.199-6.310, p\u2009=\u20090.007).Our findings suggest that 30% of breast cancer survivors will have AWS during the first year of survivorship. As institutions prioritize screening efforts, early postoperative prospective surveillance is needed for women over 60 due to high risk for AWS development and any women with AWS for increased risk of lymphedema development based on our findings.",
  "To investigate the prevalence of chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis, quantitate the epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) volume in breast cancer patients, and explore the mediating effect of liver fat content on EAT volume in breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).From October 2018 to April 2020, patients were retrospectively reviewed and divided into breast cancer non-NAC and NAC groups. The prevalence of chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis was evaluated through quantitative MRI mDIXON-Quant examinations by using defined proton density fat fraction cutoffs of liver fat. The EAT volume was quantified on chest CT by semi-automatic volume analysis software. Bootstrap analysis was used in the breast cancer NAC group to test the significance of the mediating effect of liver fat content on EAT volume.A total of 662 breast cancer patients (non-NAC group: 445 patients; NAC group: 217 patients) were included. The prevalence of chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis in the NAC group was significantly higher than the prevalence of hepatic steatosis in the non-NAC group (42.8% vs. 33.3%, p < 0.001). EAT volume was measured in 561 of 662 breast cancer patients, and was significantly higher in the NAC group than in the non-NAC group (137.26 \u00b1 53.48 mL vs. 125.14 \u00b1 58.77 mL, p = 0.020). In the breast cancer NAC group, the indirect effect of liver fat content on EAT volume was 2.545 (p < 0.001), and the contribution rate to the effect was 69.1%.EAT volume was significantly higher in the BC-NAC group than in the BC-non-NAC group.\u2022 The prevalence of CASH was as high as 42.8% in BC patients. \u2022 NAC significantly increased the EAT volume in BC patients. \u2022 The liver fat content caused the change of EAT volume through mediating effect.",
  "Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in women worldwide. In the United Kingdom, approximately 5% of all breast cancers are already metastatic at the time of diagnosis. An abundance of literature shows that exercise can have beneficial effects on the outcome and prognosis of breast cancer patients, yet the molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. There are several in vitro models that aim to recapitulate the response of breast cancer to exercise in vivo; this systematic review and meta-analysis summarizes the existing literature. The following search terms were used to conduct a systematic literature search using a collection of databases (last search performed May 2020): \"in vitro,\" \"exercise,\" and \"breast cancer.\" Only studies that investigated the effects of exercise on breast cancer in vitro were included. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated to determine pooled effect sizes. This meta-analysis has successfully demonstrated that various identified exercise interventions on breast cancer cells in vitro significantly reduced breast cancer cell viability, proliferation, and tumorigenic potential (SMD = -1.76, <i>P</i> = 0.004, SMD = -2.85, <i>P</i> = 0.003, and SMD = -3.15, <i>P</i> = 0.0008, respectively). A clear direction of effect was found with exercise on breast cancer cell migration in vitro, however this effect was not significant (SMD = -0.62, <i>P</i> = 0.317). To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis and systematic review investigating and summarizing literature on exercise and breast cancer in vitro, highlighting models used and priority areas for future research focus.",
  "Several studies have reported sleep disturbances during the COVID-19 virus pandemic. Little data exist about the impact of the pandemic on sleep and mental health among older women with breast cancer. We sought to examine whether women with and without breast cancer who experienced new sleep problems during the pandemic had worsening depression and anxiety.Breast cancer survivors aged \u226560\u00a0years with a history of nonmetastatic breast cancer (n\u00a0=\u00a0242) and frequency-matched noncancer controls (n\u00a0=\u00a0158) active in a longitudinal cohort study completed a COVID-19 virus pandemic survey from May to September 2020 (response rate 83%). Incident sleep disturbance was measured using the restless sleep item from the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D). CES-D score (minus the sleep item) captured depressive symptoms; the State-Anxiety subscale of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory measured anxiety symptoms. Multivariable linear regression models examined how the development of sleep disturbance affected changes in depressive or anxiety symptoms from the most recent prepandemic survey to the pandemic survey, controlling for covariates.The prevalence of sleep disturbance during the pandemic was 22.3%, with incident sleep disturbance in 10% and 13.5% of survivors and controls, respectively. Depressive and anxiety symptoms significantly increased during the pandemic among women with incident sleep disturbance (vs. no disturbance) (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a08.16, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01 and \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a06.14, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, respectively), but there were no survivor-control differences in the effect.Development of sleep disturbances during the COVID-19 virus pandemic may negatively affect older women's mental health, but breast cancer survivors diagnosed with the nonmetastatic disease had similar experiences as women without cancer.",
  "The purpose of this study is to investigate chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) in breast cancer patients, analyze absolute concentration and structural changes of metabolites in different brain regions by multimodal neuroimaging technology, and explore correlation between them. Breast cancer patients with chemotherapy treatment group (Ctx+, N = 24) and control group without treatment (Ctx-, N = 20) underwent neuropsychological tests, multivoxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) before and after chemotherapy. Regions of interest (ROls) in magnetic resonance scan include bilateral posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG), bilateral dorsal thalamus (DT), bilateral lenticular nucleus (LN), bilateral posterior horn of the lateral ventricle paratrigonal white matter (PWM). In MRS, absolute concentrations of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), myo-inositol (MI), choline-containing compounds (Cho), total creatine (tCr), glutamine + glutamate (Glx) were quantified using LC Model and SAGE software. In DTI, we used fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) to reflect white matter integrity. In Ctx+ patients, scores of functional assessment of cancer treatment cognition test (FACT-Cog), perceived cognitive impairments (PCI), impact of perceived impairments on quality of life (QOL), perceived cognitive abilities (PCA), auditory-verbal learning test (AVLT) recognition and clock drawing test (CDT) were lower than those before chemotherapy (p < 0.05). In MRS, Ctx+ patients had significantly lower NAA values in bilateral PCG, DT, respectively. The concentrations of tCr were observed to decline in bilateral PCG and right DT. Glx values decreased in right DT. Cho values decreased significantly in bilateral DT. In DTI, Ctx+ patients had lower FA values in bilateral PCG compared with patients before chemotherapy. Among imaging metrics and cognitive scores, positive correlations were observed between changes in AVLT recognition scores and changes in NAA values in bilateral PCG (left PCG: r = 0.470, p < 0.01; right PCG: r = 0.500, p < 0.01). Positive correlations were also found between changes in AVLT recognition and changes in FA values in bilateral PCG (left PCG: r = 0.513, p < 0.01; right PCG: r = 0.563, p < 0.01). Chemotherapy can lead to a decrease in memory function, accompanied by changes in brain metabolite concentration and white matter integrity in some parts of brain.",
  "Breast cancer diagnosed in very young women (VYWBC; \u226435 years) and young women (YWBC; 36-45 years) tends to be heterogeneous. The current study aimed to compare the clinicopathological characteristics and long-term clinical outcomes between YWBC and VYWBC subgroups.The institutional prospectively led database was retrospectively analysed from 2000 to 2014\u202fat the National Institute of Oncology, Hungary. A total of 297 patients were assigned to the VYWBC group, and 301 patients were assigned to the YWBC group.The median follow-up period was 69 months for the VYWBC group and 79 months for the YWBC group. Significant differences were observed based on breast cancer subtype. The proportion of Triple-negative and ER-negative patients was higher in the VYWBC group than in the YWBC group (P\u202f=\u202f0.00008). The incidence of distant metastasis was significantly higher in the VYWBC group (P\u202f=\u202f0.01). Significant differences in the frequency of chemotherapy (P\u202f=\u202f0.049) and endocrine therapy (P\u202f=\u202f0.037) were observed between the two groups. The YWBC group exhibited significantly better overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates than did the VYWBC group (P\u202f=\u202f0.00005 and P\u202f=\u202f0.00004, respectively).Breast cancers in VYWBC are biologically different from those in YWBC and tend to be more aggressive. Younger age was associated with worse OS and DFS. Young women with breast cancer should be subgrouped into VYWBC and YWBC populations, and these subgroups should be targeted by specialized clinical trials and further investigations.",
  "This article aims to provide a detailed description of the Singapore Breast Cancer Cohort (SGBCC), an ongoing multi-ethnic cohort established with the overarching goal to identify genetic markers for breast cancer risk, prognosis and treatment response, as well as to understand the ethnic differences in disease risk and outcome in an Asian setting. The cohort comprises of breast cancer patients aged 21 years and above from six public hospitals which diagnose and treat nearly 76% breast cancer cases in Singapore. Self-reported data on sociodemographic and lifestyle, reproductive risk factors, medical history and family history of breast or ovarian cancer is collected using a structured questionnaire. Clinical data on tumour characteristics, and treatment modalities are obtained through medical record. Bio-specimens (blood or saliva) is collected at recruitment. Follow-up on survival information is done through routine linkage with the Registry of Births and Deaths. As of 31 December 2016, 7,768 subjects have been recruited to the study with 76% subjects contributed bio-specimens. The SGBCC provides a valuable platform which offers a unique, large and rich resource for new research ideas on breast cancer related phenotypic risk factors and genetic markers.",
  "Tumors of the inner quadrants of the breast are associated with poorer survival than those of the upper-outer quadrant. It is unknown whether racial differences in breast cancer outcomes are modified by breast quadrant, in addition to comparisons among Asian subgroups.Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, we analyzed data among women diagnosed with non-metastatic invasive breast cancer between 1990 and 2014. We performed Cox proportional hazards regression models to assess the associations of race with breast cancer-specific survival and overall survival, stratified by breast quadrants. The models were adjusted for age, year of the diagnosis, tumor size, grade, histological type, tumor laterality, lymph node, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and treatments.Among 454,154 patients (73.0% White, 10.0% Black, 7.8% Asian/PI, and 9.2% Hispanic), 54.3% had tumors diagnosed in the upper-outer quadrant of the breast. Asian/PI women were more likely than White to have tumors diagnosed in the nipple/central portion of the breast and were less likely to have diagnosed in the upper-outer quadrant (P\u2009<\u20090.001), despite a similar distribution of breast quadrant between Black, Hispanic, and White women. Compared with White women, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios of breast cancer-specific mortality were 1.41 (95% CI 1.37-1.44) in Black women, 0.82 (95% CI 0.79-0.85) in Asian women, and 1.05 (95% CI 1.02-1.09) in Hispanic women. Among Asian subgroups, Japanese American women had a lower risk of breast cancer-specific mortality (HR\u2009=\u20090.68, 95% CI 0.62-0.74) compared with White women. Overall survival was similar to breast cancer-specific survival in each race group. The race-associated risks did not vary significantly by breast quadrants for breast cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality.Differences in breast cancer survival by race could not be attributed to tumor locations. Understanding the cultural, biological, and lifestyle factors that vary between White, African American, and ethnic subgroups of Asian American women may help explain these survival differences.",
  "The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential correlation between lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and their clinicopathologic significance in breast cancer.Western blot and qRT-PCR were used to detect the expression levels of LDHA and AMPK in eight breast cancer lines and eight breast cancer tissues. In addition, LDHA and AMPK were detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using breast cancer tissue microarrays (TMAs) of 112 patients. The association between LDHA and AMPK expression levels was statistically analyzed. So were the prognostic roles and clinicopathologic significances in breast cancer.The expression levels of LDHA and AMPK were relatively higher in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines than in non-triple-negative breast cancer (NTNBC) cell lines. LDHA and AMPK were also further up-regulated in TNBC tissues than in NTNBC tissues. Correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between LDHA and AMPK expression levels. Expression of LDHA and AMPK were significantly correlated with TNM stage, distant metastasis, Ki67 status and survival outcomes of patients. Patients with both positive expression of LDHA and AMPK showed shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS).These findings improve our understanding of the expression pattern of LDHA and AMPK in breast cancer and clarify the role of LDHA and AMPK as promising prognostic biomarkers for breast cancer.",
  "Breast cancer risk assessment is a powerful tool that guides recommendations for supplemental breast cancer screening and genetic counseling. The Tyrer-Cuzick 8 (TC8) model is widely used for calculating breast cancer risk and thus helps determine if women qualify for supplemental screening or genetic counseling. However, the TC8 model may underestimate breast cancer risk in Black women. This study sought to assess this disparity.Data on race, breast density, body mass index (BMI), and TC8 scores were retrospectively extracted from the electronic medical record (EMR). Logistic regressions were run to evaluate racial differences in TC8 scores. Summary and correlation statistics determined relationships between BMI, breast density, and race. Rank biserial correlations were employed to explore the impact of breast density and BMI on TC8 scores.Of 15,356 patients, 5796 were White and 5813 were Black. Black patients had higher rates of BMI\u2009\u2265\u200927 compared with White women (79.2% vs. 45.7%), lower rates of breast density (35.1% vs. 56.2%), and lower rates of high-risk TC8 scores (10.7% vs. 17.5%, OR\u2009=\u20091.6646). There was an inverse relationship between TC8 score and BMI (r<sub>rb</sub>\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.04) and a direct relationship between TC8 score and breast density (r<sub>rb</sub>\u2009=\u20090.37).Black women are less likely to have high-risk TC8 scores despite having only marginally lower breast cancer incidence rates and higher breast cancer mortality rates than White women. This suggests that the TC8 model underestimates breast cancer risk in Black women, possibly due to lower rates of breast density and higher BMIs among Black women.",
  "Trophoblast Cell Surface Antigen 2 (TROP2) is a glycoprotein expressed in many cancers. A TROP2 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) was effective in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We studied TROP2 gene (TACSTD2) expression and associations with tumor and clinical characteristics, as well as selected external genes in primary breast cancer.TACSTD2 gene expression was evaluated using microarray data from I-SPY 1 (n\u2009=\u2009149), METABRIC (n\u2009=\u20091992), and TCGA (n\u2009=\u2009817). Associations with clinical features (Kruskal-Wallis test, all datasets), chemotherapy response (Wilcoxon rank sum test, I-SPY 1), recurrence free survival (Cox proportional hazard model, I-SPY 1 and METABRIC), and selected genes (Pearson correlations, all datasets) were determined.TACSTD2 gene expression was detectable in all breast cancer subtypes, with a wide range of expression (all datasets). TACSTD2 gene expression was lower in HER2\u2009+\u2009than HR\u2009+\u2009/HER2- and TNBC (METABRIC: p\u2009=\u20090.03, TCGA p\u2009=\u20090.007), and in HER2\u2009+\u2009enriched and luminal B breast cancer (METABRIC: p\u2009<\u20090.001, TCGA: p\u2009<\u20090.001). TACSTD2 expression was higher in grade I vs. II/III tumors (METABRIC: p\u2009<\u20090.001). No association with chemotherapy response (I-SPY 1) or recurrence free survival (I-SPY 1 and METABRIC) was seen. TACSTD2 has significant positive correlations with the expression of epithelial/adhesion genes and proliferative genes, but was inversely correlated with immune genes.TACSTD2 gene expression was seen in all breast cancer subtypes particularly luminal A and TNBC, and correlated with the expression of genes involved in cell epithelial transformation, adhesion, and proliferation, which contribute to tumor growth. These results support the investigation of TROP2 ADC in all subtypes of breast cancer.",
  "The impact of mammography screening recall on quality-of-life (QOL) has been studied in women at average risk for breast cancer, but it is unknown whether these effects differ by breast cancer risk level. We used a vignette-based survey to evaluate how women across the spectrum of breast cancer risk perceive the experience of screening recall.Women participating in mammography or breast MRI screening were recruited to complete a vignette-based survey. Using a numerical rating scale (0-100), women rated QOL for hypothetical scenarios of screening recall, both before and after benign results were known. Lifetime breast cancer risk was calculated using Gail and BRCAPRO risk models. Risk perception, trait anxiety, and breast cancer worry were assessed using validated instruments.The final study cohort included 162 women at low (n\u00a0=\u00a043, 26%), intermediate (n\u00a0=\u00a066, 41%), and high-risk (n\u00a0=\u00a053, 33%). Actual breast cancer risk was not a predictor of QOL for any of the presented scenarios. Across all risk levels, QOL ratings were significantly lower for the period during diagnostic uncertainty compared to after benign results were known (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In multivariable regression analyses, breast cancer worry was a significant predictor of decreased QoL for all screening scenarios while awaiting results, including scenarios with non-invasive imaging alone or with biopsy. High trait anxiety and family history predicted lower QOL scores after receipt of benign test results (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).Women with high trait anxiety and family history may particularly benefit from discussions about the risk of recall when choosing a screening regimen.",
  "<i>ACBD3</i> overexpression has previously been found to correlate with worse prognosis for breast cancer patients and, as an incredibly diverse protein in both function and cellular localisation, ACBD3 may have a larger role in breast cancer than previously thought. This study further investigated ACBD3's role in breast cancer. Bioinformatic databases were queried to characterise <i>ACBD3</i> expression and mutation in breast cancer and to investigate how overexpression affects breast cancer patient outcomes. Immunohistochemistry was carried out to examine ACBD3 location within cells and tissue structures. <i>ACBD3</i> was more highly expressed in breast cancer than in any other cancer or matched normal tissue, and expression over the median level resulted in reduced relapse-free, overall, and distant metastasis-free survival for breast cancer patients as a whole, with some differences observed between subtypes. IHC analysis found that ACBD3 levels varied based on hormone receptor status, indicating that ACBD3 could be a candidate biomarker for poor patient prognosis in breast cancer and may possibly be a biomarker for ER signal reprogramming of precancerous breast tissue.",
  "Radiotherapy is one of the conventional methods for the clinical treatment of breast cancer. However, radioresistance has an adverse effect on the prognosis of breast cancer patients after radiotherapy. In this study, using bioinformatic analysis of GSE59732 and GSE59733 datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database together with the prognosis database of breast cancer patients after radiotherapy, the <i>GDF15</i> gene was screened out to be related to the poor prognosis of breast cancer after radiotherapy. Compared with radiosensitive parental breast cancer cells, breast cancer cells with acquired radioresistance exhibited a high level of GDF15 expression and enhanced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) properties of migration and invasion, as well as obvious stem-like traits, including the increases of mammosphere formation ability, the proportion of stem cells (CD44<sup>+</sup> CD24<sup>-</sup> cells), and the expressions of stem cell-related markers (SOX2, NANOG). Moreover, knockdown of <i>GDF15</i> sensitized the radioresistance cells to irradiation and significantly inhibited their EMT and stem-like traits, indicating that GDF15 promoted the radioresistance of breast cancer by enhancing the properties of EMT and stemness. Conclusively, GDF15 may be applicable as a novel prognosis-related biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer radiotherapy.",
  "The gene BRCA1 plays a key role in DNA repair in breast and ovarian cell lines and this is considered one of target tumor suppressor genes in same line of cancers. The 5382insC mutation is among the most frequently detected in patients (Eastern Europe) with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In Ukraine, there is not enough awareness of necessity to test patients with TNBC for BRCA1 mutations. That is why this group of patients is not well-studied, even through is known the mutation may affect the course of disease.The biological samples of 408 female patients were analyzed of the 5382insC mutation in BRCA1. We compared the frequency of the 5382insC mutation in BRCA1 gene observed in Ukraine with known frequencies in other countries.For patients with TNBC, BRCA1 mutations frequency was 11.3%, while in patients with luminal types of breast cancers, the frequency was 2.8%. Prevalence of 5382insC among TNBC patients reported in this study was not different from those in Tunisia, Poland, Russia, and Bulgaria, but was higher than in Australia and Germany.The BRCA1 c.5382 mutation rate was recorded for the first time for TNBC patients in a Ukrainian population. The results presented in this study underscore the importance of this genetic testing of mutations in patients with TNBC. Our study supports BRCA1/2 genetic testing for all women diagnosed with TNBC, regardless of the age of onset or family history of cancer and not only for women diagnosed with TNBC at <60y.o., as guidelines recommend.",
  "Chemoresistance is one of the major challenges in the treatment of breast cancer. Recent evidence suggests that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a critical role in not only metastasis but also in chemoresistance, hence causing tumor relapse. This study aimed to identify the hub genes associated with EMT and chemoresistance in breast cancer affecting patient/clinical survival. Commonly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during EMT and chemoresistance in breast cancer cells were identified using publicly available datasets, GSE23655, GSE39359, GSE33146 and GSE76540. Hierarchical clustering analysis was utilized to determine the commonly DEGs expression pattern in chemoresistant (CR) breast cancer cells. GSEA revealed that EMT-related genes sets were enriched in the CR samples. Further, we found that EMT-induced breast cancer cells showed overexpression of drug efflux transporters along with resistance to chemotherapeutic drug. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the commonly DEGs were enriched in immunological pathways, early endosome, protein dimerization, and proteoglycans in cancer. Further, we identified eight hub genes from the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. We validated the gene expression levels of the hub genes among TCGA breast cancer samples using UALCAN. Survival analysis for the hub genes was performed using KM plotter, which showed a worse relapse-free survival (RFS) of the hub genes among breast cancer patients. In conclusion, this study identified eight hub genes that play an important role in the pathways underlying EMT-induced chemoresistance in breast cancer and can be used as therapeutic targets after clinical validation.",
  "Breast cancer remains the most common nonskin cancer, the second leading cause of cancer deaths, and the leading cause of premature death in US women. Mammography screening has been proven effective in reducing breast cancer deaths in women age 40 years and older. A mortality reduction of 40% is possible with regular screening. Treatment advances cannot overcome the disadvantage of being diagnosed with an advanced-stage tumor. The ACR and Society of Breast Imaging recommend annual mammography screening beginning at age 40, which provides the greatest mortality reduction, diagnosis at earlier stage, better surgical options, and more effective chemotherapy. Annual screening results in more screening-detected tumors, tumors of smaller sizes, and fewer interval cancers than longer screening intervals. Screened women in their 40s are more likely to have early-stage disease, negative lymph nodes, and smaller tumors than unscreened women. Delaying screening until age 45 or 50 will result in an unnecessary loss of life to breast cancer and adversely affects minority women in particular. Screening should continue past age 74 years, without an upper age limit unless severe comorbidities limit life expectancy. Benefits of screening should be considered along with the possibilities of recall for additional imaging and benign biopsy and the less tangible risks of anxiety and overdiagnosis. Although recall and biopsy recommendations are higher with more frequent screening, so are life-years gained and breast cancer deaths averted. Women who wish to maximize benefit will choose annual screening starting at age 40 years and will not stop screening prematurely.",
  "Prior studies have underlined the prognostic relevance of pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer. However, an accurate demonstration of treatment efficacy is dependent on its potential to predict long-term outcomes of recurrence and death, and this issue remains somewhat controversial.One hundred and sixty-nine patients with breast cancer (BC) treated with NAC followed by surgery were enrolled in this retrospective study. After carrying out multivariable analyses, involving baseline characteristics (tumor stage, nodal status, histological grade, biological profile) and response status, we analysed the association between pCR and disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in various subtypes. Moreover, we investigated several residual disease-scoring combinations to check whether they could discriminate prognostic subsets according to their variable tumor range after NAC.Overall, factors associated with pCR were non-luminal subtype (p<0.001), high grade (p=0.001) and HER2-overexpression (p=0.001). Residual tumor and nodal stage after NAC significantly correlated with DFS (p=0.007) and OS (p<0.001). Similarly, pCR after NAC showed significantly better DFS (p=0.01), particularly for HER2-positive (p=0.003), triple-negative (p=0.019) and HER2-positive Luminal B profiles (p=0.019). However, there was no statistical difference in the OS among patients who had PCR, compared to absence of pCR (p=0.40).Extent of residual disease and evidence of regression provide helpful prognostic details in BC patients treated with NAC. Achieving pCR after NAC is related with significantly better DFS, with the potential of maximized breast and axillary conservation based on clinical response. The distribution of expertise in a cross-disciplinary setting could provide safe and favourable prognosis, while improving cosmetic outcomes and quality of life.",
  "Weight gain after a breast cancer diagnosis is common and is associated with inferior outcomes. Young survivors may be especially susceptible to weight changes given the impact of treatment on menopausal status.The authors identified women who were diagnosed with stage 0 to III breast cancer at age 40\u2009years or younger between 2006 and 2016 from a multicenter prospective cohort. Self-reported weight was collected at diagnosis and at 1\u2009year and 3\u2009years postdiagnosis. Tumor and treatment data were obtained from medical records and patient surveys. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify the factors associated with weight gain (\u22655%) or weight loss (\u22655%) versus stable weight at 1\u2009year and 3\u2009years postdiagnosis.The cohort included 956 women with a median age of 37\u2009years at diagnosis. Mean weight significantly increased over time from 66.54\u2009\u00b1\u200914.85\u2009kg at baseline to 67.33\u2009\u00b1\u200915.53 and 67.77\u2009\u00b1\u200914.65\u2009kg at 1\u2009year and 3\u2009years, respectively (p\u2009\u2264\u2009.001 for both comparisons). The proportion of women experiencing \u22655% weight gain increased from 24.8% at 1\u2009year to 33.9% at 3\u2009years. At 1\u2009year, less self-perceived financial comfort, Black race, and stage III disease were significantly associated with weight gain; at 3\u2009years, only less self-perceived financial comfort remained significant. Baseline overweight or obesity was significantly associated with weight loss at both time points. Chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and treatment-related menopause were not associated with weight change.One third of young breast cancer survivors experienced clinically significant weight gain 3\u2009years after diagnosis; however, treatment-related associations were not observed. Age-appropriate lifestyle interventions, including the reduction of financial barriers, are needed to prevent weight gain in this high-risk population.",
  "Multidisciplinary team (MDT) discussions are widely held to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer, but patient compliance with the MDT recommendations and the impact of compliance on disease outcome are uncertain.We conducted a retrospective review of data from a prospective database of breast cancer patients treated at Shanghai Ruijin Hospital between April 2013 and August 2018. MDT discussions were held for all patients before they started adjuvant therapy. The patients were classified into compliant and non-compliant groups according to whether they received the MDT-recommended regimens. We also analyzed which clinicopathological factors were associated with compliance and prognosis.Of 4501 breast cancer patients, 3681 (81.8%) and 820 (18.2%) were included in the compliant and non-compliant groups, respectively. Age >70 years (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), invasive ductal carcinoma (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and histological grade III (P\u00a0=\u00a00.011) were independently associated with higher risk of non-compliance, whereas Ki-67 labeling index \u226514% and history of benign breast disease were independently associated with compliance. Disease-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 1.813, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.367-2.405, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and overall survival (HR 2.478, 95% CI 1.431-4.291, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were worse in the non-compliant group.Several clinicopathological factors were associated with non-compliance with MDT recommendations for early breast cancer patients. Non-compliance was associated with worse disease outcome.",
  "Purpose of our study is to assess the relationship between MRI findings and invasive breast cancer (IBC) with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that are positive for podoplanin.We retrospectively analyzed the consecutive 109 IBCs. The IBCs were dichotomized as with (+) or without (-) podoplanin-positive CAFs. In MRI analyses, the dichotomized IBCs were compared the lesion to muscle ratio (L/M ratio) in STIR images, the ADC value, the distribution of kinetic parameters, and morphological findings.Of the 109 IBCs, 28 (26%) IBCs had podoplanin(+) CAFs. Compared to the podoplanin(-) group, the podoplanin(+) group tended to have a more malignant pathological status. In the STIR images, the podoplanin(+) group had significantly higher L/M ratio (7.59 vs. 6.55, p\u2009=\u20090.040). In a dynamic study, the podoplanin(+) group had a significantly higher percentage of the washout pattern (42.21% vs. 29.43%, p\u2009=\u20090.045). There were 23 mass lesions and 5 non-mass enhancement (NME) lesions in the podoplanin(+) group, and 69 mass lesions and 12 NME lesions in the podoplanin(-) group. The mass lesions of the podoplanin(-) group had a significantly higher likelihood of showing an irregular shape (n\u2009=\u200947 vs. 8, p\u2009=\u20090.035). The podoplanin(+) group's lesions had a significantly higher likelihood of showing a circumscribed margin (n\u2009=\u200914 vs. 6, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and a rim enhancement (n\u2009=\u200910 vs. 13, p\u2009=\u20090.047). In multivariate analyses, only high nuclear grade was significant predictive value of podoplanin(+) CAFs.Although not significant in multivariate analyses, MRI findings may be used to determine the podoplanin-positive CAF status of invasive breast cancer.",
  "The American Cancer Society (ACS) published an updated Guideline for Cancer Prevention (ACS Guideline) in 2020. Research suggests that adherence to the 2012 ACS Guideline might lower breast cancer risk, but there is limited evidence that this applies to women at increased familial and genetic risk of breast cancer.Using the Breast Cancer Family Registry (BCFR), a cohort enriched for increased familial and genetic risk of breast cancer, we examined adherence to three 2020 ACS Guideline recommendations (weight management (body mass index), physical activity, and alcohol consumption) with breast cancer risk in 9615 women. We used Cox proportional hazard regression modeling to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) overall and stratified by BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variant status, family history of breast cancer, menopausal status, and estrogen receptor-positive (ER\u2009+) breast cancer.We observed 618 incident invasive or in situ breast cancers over a median 12.9\u00a0years. Compared with being adherent to none (n\u2009=\u200955 cancers), being adherent to any ACS recommendation (n\u2009=\u2009563 cancers) was associated with a 27% lower breast cancer risk (HR\u2009=\u20090.73, 95% CI: 0.55-0.97). This was evident for women with a first-degree family history of breast cancer (HR\u2009=\u20090.68, 95% CI: 0.50-0.93), women without BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variants (HR\u2009=\u20090.71, 95% CI: 0.53-0.95), postmenopausal women (HR\u2009=\u20090.63, 95% CI: 0.44-0.89), and for risk of ER+\u2009breast cancer (HR\u2009=\u20090.63, 95% CI: 0.40-0.98).Adherence to the 2020 ACS Guideline recommendations for BMI, physical activity, and alcohol consumption could reduce breast cancer risk for postmenopausal women and women at increased familial risk.",
  "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients often exhibit poor prognosis and breast cancer relapse due to metastasis. This results in secondary tumor generation at distant-unrelated organs that account for the majority of breast cancer-related deaths. Although breast cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been attributed to metastasis, a mechanistic understanding is essential for developing therapeutic interventions to combat breast cancer relapse. Breast CSCs are generated due to Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), regulated by transcription factors (EMT-TF) that are implicated in tumorigenesis and metastasis. However, the underlying mechanisms mediating these processes remain elusive. In the present study, we have reported that TWIST1, an EMT-TF, exhibits positive transcriptional regulation on PDGFR\u03b2 promoter, thus identifying PDGFR\u03b2 as one of the downstream targets of EMT regulation in breast CSCs. Breast cancer cells overexpressing PDGFR\u03b2 exhibited a significant increase in physiological and molecular properties comparable to that of breast CSCs, while molecular silencing of PDGFR\u03b2 in breast CSCs perturbed these phenomena. Mechanistically, PDGFR\u03b2 overexpression induced the activation of FAK and Src leading to cell migration and invasion. Orthotopic xenograft transplantation of stable breast cancer cells and CSCs with PDGFR\u03b2 overexpression in nude mice led to a significant increase in tumorigenesis, and metastasis to lung and liver as depicted by the significant increase in human gene-specific PDGFR\u03b2 and CD44 expression, and colocalization along with an expression of human-specific Alu sequences which were perturbed with stable silencing of PDGFR\u03b2 in breast CSCs. Thus, PDGFR\u03b2 plays a crucial role in inducing breast cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis that can be a plausible therapeutic target to treat TNBC patients.",
  "To evaluate prevalence of pelvic floor disorders, association of endocrine therapy with pelvic floor disorders, and rates of pelvic floor surgery among breast cancer survivors compared to matched controls without history of cancer.This is a retrospective, cohort study using electronic medical record data from a ten-hospital regional healthcare system. A total of 19,483 women diagnosed with breast cancer between January 2008 and April 2020 were propensity score matched to 19,483 women without a history of cancer. Medical charts were abstracted for ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes for pelvic floor disorders, use of endocrine therapy, and CPT codes for pelvic floor surgeries and procedures.Overall, the prevalence of pelvic floor disorders was lower among breast cancer survivors (8.8% vs. 22.6%, p < 0.001), and mean time to development of pelvic floor disorders among breast cancer survivors was 3 years. Selective estrogen receptor modulators and aromatase inhibitors were associated with pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence, while estrogen antagonists were associated with urge urinary incontinence and lower urinary tract symptoms. Women with breast cancer had similar or higher rates of pelvic floor surgery compared to matched controls.Rates of pelvic floor disorders were lower among breast cancer survivors compared to controls but rates of surgical intervention did not differ and were higher for some conditions among breast cancer survivors.Screening for these disorders should be considered as part of routine survivorship care.",
  "Breast cancer remains the second most diagnosed cancer in women worldwide and the number one cause of cancer in women in the United States. It is unfortunately the primary cause of cancerrelated deaths among women, with 14% of all cancer deaths attributed to it. Over the past decade, screening methods have matured, and imaging modalities are continuously improving. \nScreening mammograms remain the only modality that have been shown to improve breast cancer survival, however, more modalities like MRI, abbreviated MRI, and CT mammography are gaining in momentum. \nNow more than ever, providers need to identify the patient population that is at an elevated risk for breast cancer to offer them a personalized screening approach specific to their empiric risk. In this paper we shed light on risk factors of breast cancer and summarize risk assessment tools that have been recently incorporated in assessing a woman's risk of breast cancer. \nWe also summarize new genetic testing strategies and their implications in prevention of breast cancer. And finally, we offer a personalized approach to management of women with agenetic predisposition as well as to women at elevated risk but without a genetic mutation. The hope is to identify women at increased risk and perfect a \"personalized screening approach\" for breast cancer.",
  "Although patients receiving renal replacement therapy (RRT) have more comorbidities and higher mortality and morbidity risks than the general population, surgery during breast cancer treatment is crucial because of limitations in anticancer agents for patients with renal insufficiency. We aimed to compare the short-term postoperative outcomes between patients with and without RRT.Patients who underwent surgery for stages 0-III breast cancer between July 2010 and March 2017 were retrospectively identified in a Japanese nationwide inpatient database and divided into those with RRT (RRT group, n\u2009=\u20091547) and those without RRT (control group, n\u2009=\u2009364,047). We generated a 1:4 matched-pair cohort matched for age, institution, and fiscal year at admission. We conducted multivariable regression analyses to compare postoperative complications, 30-day readmission, and anesthesia duration between the two groups.The RRT group was more likely to have comorbidities (95.0% vs. 24.1%) and undergo total mastectomy (64.2% vs. 47.0%) than the control group. The RRT group was not significantly associated with complications (odds ratio 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89-1.56) and 30-day readmission (odds ratio 0.88; 95% CI 0.65-1.18), but was associated with shorter anesthesia duration (difference,\u2009-\u20096.8\u00a0min; 95% CI\u2009-\u200910.7 to\u2009-\u20093.0\u00a0min) compared with the control group.The matched-pair cohort analyses revealed no significant differences in postoperative complications after breast cancer surgery between patients with and without RRT. Breast cancer surgery in patients with RRT may be as safe as that in patients without RRT, if comorbidities other than chronic renal failure are adequately addressed.",
  "Relative to other metastatic breast cancer subtypes, metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) has a shorter duration of response to therapy and worse overall survival. Among patients with mTNBC, it is hypothesized that inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) and young women have particularly aggressive phenotypes. We investigated clinical and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) characteristics of inflammatory-mTNBC and young-mTNBC.We evaluated 158 patients with mTNBC who were stratified into 3 groups: (1) IBC; (2) patients aged 45 years or younger at primary diagnosis without IBC (non-IBC young); and (3) patients over age 45 at diagnosis without IBC. We evaluated clinicopathologic characteristics, sites of metastasis, survival outcomes, and the fraction of DNA in circulation derived from tumor (TFx).Analysis of metastatic sites revealed that young patients without IBC had the most frequent lung metastases (P\u00a0= .002). cfDNA analyses of first sample showed that TFx was highest in the non-IBC young group but not elevated in the IBC group (analysis of variance P\u00a0= .056 for first TFx). Individually, median overall survival from metastatic diagnosis for the IBC group was 15.2 months; for the non-IBC young group, 21.2 months, and for the non-IBC over 45 group, 31.2 months. Patients with IBC and young patients without IBC had worse prognosis relative to patients over 45 without IBC (log-rank P\u00a0= .023).Among patients with mTNBC in this single-institution cohort, patients with IBC and young patients without IBC had significantly worse overall survival compared with patients over 45 without IBC. Young patients without IBC had significantly higher cfDNA TFx, whereas patients with IBC did not have elevated TFx despite a poor prognosis. These findings demonstrate that further analyses of mTNBC subsets are warranted.",
  "Social media messages and conversations provide an opportunity to study what users post about cancer risk and preventive behaviors. Personal stories of early detection, treatment, and survivorship are often shared. The purpose of this study was to examine the hereditary breast cancer-focused posts on the understudied visual social media platform Pinterest. Using systematic random sampling, n\u2009=\u2009500 Pinterest posts (referred to as \"pins\") were collected using the keywords \"breast cancer\" and \"genetic testing\" in the late 2017. Using a quantitative content analysis, pins were coded for a variety of categories including poster identity, pin characteristics and content, the presence of Health Belief Model constructs, and engagement variables (i.e., repins/saves and comments). The primary findings of this study reveal that most pins were published by individuals and relatively few messages contained specific information about genetic testing. Study results also describe how Pinterest users interact with the content, including higher engagement with information-rich visuals and traditional breast cancer awareness symbols. The information gained from this study may serve as the foundation for better understanding how social media can be used to communicate with women about heritable breast health-related cancers, risks, and protective behaviors. Study results prompt practical recommendations for public health organizations interested in reaching women seeking information about heritable breast cancer on Pinterest.",
  "Over one million women in the United States receive biopsy diagnoses of benign breast disease (BBD) each year, which confer a 1.5-4.0-fold increase in breast cancer risk. Studies in the general population suggest that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAID) lower breast cancer risk; however, associations among women with BBD are unknown. We assessed whether NSAID use among women diagnosed with BBD is associated with lower breast cancer risk. Participants included 3,080 women (mean age = 50.3 \u00b1 13.5 years) in the Mayo BBD surgical biopsy cohort diagnosed between January 1, 1992 and December 31, 2001 who completed breast cancer risk factor questionnaires that assessed NSAID use, and whose biopsies underwent detailed pathology review, masked to outcome. Women were followed from date of BBD biopsy to breast cancer diagnosis (main outcome) or censoring (death, prophylactic mastectomy, reduction mammoplasty, lobular carcinoma <i>in situ</i> or last contact). Median follow-up time was 16.4 \u00b1 6.0 years. Incident breast cancer was diagnosed among 312 women over a median follow-up of 9.9 years. Regular non-aspirin NSAID use was associated with lower breast cancer risk [HR = 0.63; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.46-0.85; <i>P</i> = 0.002] with trends of lower risk (highest tertiles of use vs. nonuse) for greater number of years used [HR = 0.55; 95% CI = 0.31-0.97; <i>P</i> <sub>trend</sub> = 0.003), days used per month (HR = 0.51; 95% CI = 0.33-0.80; <i>P</i> <sub>trend</sub> = 0.001) and lifetime number of doses taken (HR = 0.53; 95% CI = 0.31-0.89; <i>P</i> <sub>trend</sub> = 0.003). We conclude that nonaspirin NSAID use is associated with statistically significant lower breast cancer risk after a BBD biopsy, including a dose-response effect, suggesting a potential role for NSAIDs in breast cancer prevention among patients with BBD.",
  "Circular RNAs are a large group of non-coding RNAs with a closed-loop structure. circRNAs play significant roles in many biological processes as miRNA sponges, regulators for gene transcription, combining with RNA-binding proteins and translation of protein. Nowadays, circRNAs have become a research hotspot in the field of cancer and molecular biology. Accumulating evidences have indicated that circRNAs participate in the initiation and development of various cancers such as breast cancer. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, which is the most common malignancy in women. The incidence and mortality rates of breast cancer indicate that it is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. The goal of the present review is to introduce biogenesis, function characteristics and types of circRNAs, and also their biological functions on breast cancer, especially as miRNA sponges. Additionally, we discuss their use as a new therapeutic target for the treatment of breast cancer.",
  "<b>Background:</b> Bone metastasis is a frequent symptom of breast cancer and current targeted therapy has limited efficacy. Osteoclasts play critical roles to drive osteolysis and metastatic outgrowth of tumor cells in bone. Previously we identified CST6 as a secretory protein significantly downregulated in bone-metastatic breast cancer cells. Functional analysis showed that CST6 suppresses breast-to-bone metastasis in animal models. However, the functional mechanism and therapeutic potential of CST6 in bone metastasis is unknown. <b>Methods:</b> Using <i>in vitro</i> osteoclastogenesis and <i>in vivo</i> metastasis assays, we studied the effect and mechanism of extracellular CST6 protein in suppressing osteoclastic niches and bone metastasis of breast cancer. A number of peptides containing the functional domain of CST6 were screened to inhibit bone metastasis. The efficacy, stability and toxicity of CST6 recombinant protein and peptides were evaluated in preclinical metastasis models. <b>Results:</b> We show here that CST6 inhibits osteolytic bone metastasis by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis. Cancer cell-derived CST6 enters osteoclasts by endocytosis and suppresses the cysteine protease CTSB, leading to up-regulation of the CTSB hydrolytic substrate SPHK1. SPHK1 suppresses osteoclast maturation by inhibiting the RANKL-induced p38 activation. Importantly, recombinant CST6 protein effectively suppresses bone metastasis <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. We further identified several peptides mimicking the function of CST6 to suppress cancer cell-induced osteoclastogenesis and bone metastasis. Pre-clinical analyses of CTS6 recombinant protein and peptides demonstrated their potentials in treatment of breast cancer bone metastasis. <b>Conclusion:</b> These findings reveal the CST6-CTSB-SPHK1 signaling axis in osteoclast differentiation and provide a promising approach to treat bone diseases with CST6-based peptides.",
  "Clinical studies backed by research in animal models suggest that vitamin D may protect against the development of breast cancer, implicating vitamin D as a promising candidate for breast cancer prevention. However, despite clear preclinical evidence showing protective roles for vitamin D, broadly targeted clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation have yielded conflicting findings, highlighting the complexity of translating preclinical data to efficacy in humans. While vitamin D supplementation targeted to high-risk populations is a strategy anticipated to increase prevention efficacy, a complimentary approach is to target transient, developmental windows of elevated breast cancer risk. Postpartum mammary gland involution represents a developmental window of increased breast cancer promotion that may be poised for vitamin D supplementation. Targeting the window of involution with short-term vitamin D intervention may offer a simple, cost-effective approach for the prevention of breast cancers that develop postpartum. In this review, we highlight epidemiologic and preclinical studies linking vitamin D deficiency with breast cancer development. We discuss the underlying mechanisms through which vitamin D deficiency contributes to cancer development, with an emphasis on the anti-inflammatory activity of vitamin D. We also discuss current evidence for vitamin D as an immunotherapeutic agent and the potential for vitamin D as a preventative strategy for young woman's breast cancer.",
  "Metaplastic breast cancer remains poorly characterized given its rarity and heterogeneity. The majority of metaplastic breast cancers demonstrate a phenotype of triple-negative breast cancer; however, differences in clinical outcomes between metaplastic breast cancer and triple-negative breast cancer in the era of third-generation chemotherapy remain unclear.We compared the clinical outcomes between women with metaplastic breast cancer and women with triple-negative breast cancer diagnosed between 1994 and 2014. Metaplastic breast cancer patients were matched 1:3 to triple-negative breast cancer patients by stage and age at diagnosis. Distant disease-free survival (DDFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using Kaplan Meier methods and Cox proportional hazard regression models. Immune checkpoint markers were characterized by immunohistochemistry in a subset of samples.Forty-four metaplastic breast cancer patients (stage I 14%; stage II 73%; stage III 11%; stage IV 2%) with an average age of 55.4 (\u00b1\u200913.9) years at diagnosis. Median follow-up for the included metaplastic breast cancer and triple-negative breast cancer patients (n = 174) was 2.8 (0.1-19.0) years. The DDFS and OS between matched metaplastic breast cancer and triple-negative breast cancer patients were similar, even when adjusting for clinical covariates (DDFS: HR = 1.64, p = 0.22; OS: HR = 1.64, p = 0.26). Metaplastic breast cancer samples (n = 27) demonstrated greater amount of CD163 in the stroma (p = 0.05) and PD-L1 in the tumor (p = 0.01) than triple-negative breast cancer samples (n = 119), although more triple-negative breast cancer samples were positive for CD8 in the tumor than metaplastic breast cancer samples (p = 0.02).Patients with metaplastic breast cancer had similar outcomes to those with triple-negative breast cancer based on DDFS and OS. The immune checkpoint marker profile of metaplastic breast cancers in this study may prove useful in future studies attempting to demonstrate an association between immune profile and survival.",
  "Male breast cancer is a rare malignant tumor, and outcomes of breast conservation therapy (BCT) are currently lacking.The retrospective, population-based cohort study included 1369 stage I-II (T1-2 N0-1 M0) male breast cancer patients from the SEER database (2000-2018). The patients were grouped in two groups: BCT group and mastectomy group, according to surgical and radiation therapy. Kaplan-Meier method and univariable Cox proportional hazard analysis were used to compare overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) between two treatment groups. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to balance the confounding factors.Of the 1369 men, 97 (7%) patients received BCT, 1272 (93%) received mastectomy alone. The 5- and 10-year OS rates were 92.3% and 80.7% for BCT group compared with 80.4% and 61.4% for mastectomy group. The 5- and 10-year BCSS rates were 96.5% and 93.9% for patients undergoing BCT, as compared with 93.1% and 84.4% for patients undergoing mastectomy. Compared with mastectomy group, BCT group showed improved OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.294; 95% CI 0.138-0.623, P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) and BCSS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.182; 95% CI 0.040-0.820, P\u00a0=\u00a0.027). Of the 791 patients with T1 stage, BCT showed insignificant association with OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.555; 95% CI 0.207-1.488, P\u00a0=\u00a0.242) and BCSS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.217; 95% CI 0.171-8.675, P\u00a0=\u00a0.844).The results of this cohort study suggest that BCT is at least equivalent to mastectomy in male breast cancer patients. The underlying mechanism of this association needs further research.",
  "Most studies demonstrating an association between excess adiposity and postmenopausal breast cancer have used anthropometric measures, particularly body mass index (BMI). However, more direct body fat measures may more accurately determine the relationship between body fat distribution and breast cancer risk.Cox proportional hazards regression models were created to examine the associations of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) body fat measures (at baseline and during follow-up) with breast cancer risk among 10\u00a0931 postmenopausal women from the Women's Health Initiative cohort. A total of 639 incident invasive breast cancer cases (including 484 estrogen receptor positive (ER+) cases) were ascertained after a median follow-up of 15.0\u00a0years.Excess whole body fat mass and trunk fat mass were positively associated with risk invasive breast cancer risk. These associations persisted even after additional adjustment for standard anthropometric measures. In time-dependent analyses, we observed that both whole body fat mass and trunk fat mass, in the highest versus lowest category, were associated with a doubling of risk of invasive breast cancer overall (HR: 2.17; 95% CI: 1.54-3.05 and 2.20; 1.55-3.14, respectively) and of ER+ breast cancer (2.05; 1.37-3.05 and 2.03; 1.34-3.07, respectively). The remaining DXA measures were also positively associated with breast cancer risk in baseline and time-dependent analyses.These findings suggest that DXA-derived body fat measures are positively associated with breast cancer risk after adjustment for BMI and other conventional breast cancer risk factors.",
  "Locally advanced breast cancer (LABC), the most aggressive form of the disease, is a serious threat for women's health worldwide. The AU-rich RNA-binding factor 1 (AUF1) promotes the formation of chemo-resistant breast cancer stem cells. Thereby, we investigated the power of AUF1 expression, in both cancer cells and their stromal fibroblasts, as predictive biomarker for LABC patients' clinical outcome following neoadjuvant treatment.We have used immunohistochemistry to assess the level of AUF1 on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. Immunoblotting was utilized to show the effect of AUF1 ectopic expression in breast stromal fibroblasts on the expression of various genes both in vitro and in orthotopic tumor xenografts. Cytotoxicity was evaluated using the WST1 assay, while a label-free real-time setting using the xCELLigence RTCA technology was utilized to assess the proliferative, migratory and invasive abilities of cells.We have shown that high AUF1 immunostaining (\u2265\u200910%) in both cancer cells and their adjacent cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) was significantly associated with higher tumor grade. Kaplan-Meier univariate analysis revealed a strong correlation between high AUF1 level in CAFs and poor patient's survival. This correlation was highly significant in patients with triple negative breast cancer, who showed poor disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). High expression of AUF1 in CAFs was also associated with poor OS of ER+/Her2- patients. Similarly, AUF1-positive malignant cells tended to be associated with shorter DFS and OS of ER+/Her2+ patients. Interestingly, neoadjuvant therapy downregulated AUF1 to a level lower than 10% in malignant cells in a significant number of patients, which improved both DFS and OS. In addition, ectopic expression of AUF1 in breast fibroblasts activated these cells and enhanced their capacity to promote, in an IL-6-dependent manner, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and stemness processes. Furthermore, these AUF1-expressing cells enhanced the chemoresistance of breast cancer cells and their growth in orthotopic tumor xenografts.The present findings show that the CAF-activating factor AUF1 has prognostic/predictive value for breast cancer patients and could represent a great therapeutic target in order to improve the precision of cancer treatment.",
  "Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is generally considered to be incurable. Although many options are available for treating MBC, physicians often encounter difficulties in choosing the most appropriate treatment because the MBCs of individual patients respond differently even to the same treatments. Thus, predictive markers for therapeutic efficacy are urgently needed. Neutrophil- and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratios (NLR and PLR, respectively), have been studied and established as prognostic markers for breast cancer patients but whether either or both of these markers are predictive of treatment responses is still unclear. Herein, we investigated predictive markers for eribulin-based treatment responsiveness in patients with MBC, by examining clinicopathological features, including several markers of immunocompetent cells in peripheral blood.Clinicopathological features of the 104 patients with metastatic/Stage IV breast cancer given eribulin-based regimens were investigated in relation to clinical responses to eribulin-based treatments and progression-free-survival (PFS).Special histological types and high NLR at baseline were independently related to poor clinical responses to the treatments (p\u2009=\u20090.023 and 0.039, respectively). The Cox hazard model revealed that patients with oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumours and high NLR, monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) and PLR showed significantly shorter PFS (p\u2009=\u20090.021, 0.005, 0.008 and 0.030, respectively). On multivariate analysis, only ER status and NLR remained independent factors related to PFS (p\u2009=\u20090.011 and 0.003, respectively).Our data revealed that special histological types and high NLR might be factors related to low responsiveness to eribulin-based regimens in patients with MBC.",
  "Doxorubicin (DOX) is currently one of the most widely used and effective drugs for the treatment of breast cancer, but drug resistance in breast cancer often leads to poor efficacy. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the development and progression of various tumors and increasing number of studies have confirmed that abnormal miR-520b expression is closely associated breast cancer. We analyzed the clinical features, including miR-520b, of 30 patients with breast cancer. Further, we analyzed the interaction between miR-520b and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) in breast cancer cell. miR-520b expression was significantly increased in chemotherapy-sensitive patients and was positively correlated with the chemotherapeutic efficacy in breast cancer. Cell proliferation assay confirmed that miR-520b promotes DOX-induced breast cancer cell apoptosis by regulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Moreover, bioinformatics method and dual luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that miR-520b negatively regulates IGF-1R, and IGF-1R overexpression and enhanced activity are closely associated with tumor development, progression, metastasis, and chemotherapy resistance. Similarly, cell proliferation assay showed that IGF-1R is negatively correlated with the efficacy of DOX chemotherapy and affects cell apoptosis mediated by the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. On the contrary, miR-520b can downregulate the expression of IGF-1R. miR-520b increases DOX sensitivity and promotes cell apoptosis in breast cancer by inhibiting IGF-1R expression by the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.",
  "To examine incidence and characteristics of women who developed secondary breast cancer after uterine cancer.This is a population-based retrospective cohort study utilizing the National Cancer Institute's\u00a0Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result Program from 1973 to 2013. Women with uterine cancer who did not have synchronous or a history of breast cancer were followed after their uterine cancer diagnosis (N\u2009=\u2009236,561). A time-dependent competing risk analysis was performed to examine cumulative incidences and clinico-pathological characteristics of those who subsequently developed breast cancer.There were 7110 (3.0%) women who developed secondary breast cancers after uterine cancer with 5-, 10-, and 20-year cumulative incidence rates of 1.5, 2.8, and 4.7%, respectively. The increase in the rate of secondary breast cancer was particularly high in the first 3\u00a0years after a uterine cancer diagnosis (annual percent change [APC] 4.9), followed by 3-7\u00a0years (APC 1.6) after diagnosis (P\u2009<\u20090.001). The median time to develop secondary breast cancer was 6.4\u00a0years. Older women had significantly shorter time intervals between uterine and breast cancer diagnoses (3.7\u00a0years for aged\u2009>\u200971, 5.9 for aged 64-71, 7.6 for aged 56-63, and 9.4 for aged\u2009<\u200956, P\u2009<\u20090.001).\u00a0In a\u00a0multivariable analysis, older age, White race, married status, endometrioid, serous, and mixed histology\u00a0types, and early-stage tumors remained as independent factors of developing secondary breast cancer (all, P\u2009<\u20090.05).Tumor factors with endometrioid and serous histology types and early-stage disease were the factors associated with secondary breast cancer after uterine cancer diagnosis. Older women had shorter time to develop secondary breast cancer.",
  "A large body of research studying the relationship between tobacco and cancer has led to the knowledge that smoking cigarettes adversely affects cancer treatment while contributing to the development of various tobacco-related cancers. Nicotine is the main addictive component of tobacco smoke and promotes angiogenesis, proliferation, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) while promoting growth and metastasis of tumors. Nicotine generally acts through the induction of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), although the contribution of other receptor subunits has also been reported. Nicotine contributes to the pathogenesis of a wide range of cancers including breast cancer through its carcinogens such as (4-methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) and N-nitrosonornicotine (NNN). Current study aims to review the mechanistic function of nicotine in the initiation, development, angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis, and apoptosis of breast cancer with the main focus on nicotine acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and nAChR-mediated signaling pathways as well as on its potential for the development of an effective treatment against breast cancer. Moreover, we will try to demonstrate how nicotine leads to poor treatment response in breast cancer by enhancing the population, proliferation, and self-renewal of cancer stem cells (CSCs) through the activation of \u03b17-nAChR receptors.",
  "Breast cancer represents a heterogeneous group of human cancer at both histological and molecular levels. Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) are the most commonly used biomarkers in clinical practice for making treatment plans for breast cancer patients by oncologists. Recently, PD-L1 testing plays an important role for immunotherapy for triple-negative breast cancer. With the increased understanding of the molecular characterization of breast cancer and the emergence of novel targeted therapies, more potential biomarkers are needed for the development of more personalized treatments. In this review, we summarized several main prognostic and predictive biomarkers in breast cancer at genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic levels, including hormone receptors, HER2, Ki67, multiple gene expression assays, PD-L1 testing, mismatch repair deficiency/microsatellite instability, tumor mutational burden, PIK3CA, ESR1 andNTRK and briefly introduced the roles of digital imaging analysis in breast biomarker evaluation.",
  "The survival benefit from detecting additional breast cancers by preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) continues to be controversial.We followed a cohort of 4454 women diagnosed with non-metastatic breast cancer (stage I-III) from 2/2005-6/2010 in five registries of the breast cancer surveillance consortium (BCSC). BCSC clinical and registry data were linked to Medicare claims and enrollment data. We estimated the cumulative probability of breast cancer-specific and all-cause mortality. We tested the association of preoperative MRI with all-cause mortality using a Cox proportional hazards model.917 (20.6%) women underwent preoperative MRI. No significant difference in the cumulative probability of breast cancer-specific mortality was found. We observed no significant difference in the hazard of all-cause mortality during the follow-up period after adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical factors among women with MRI (HR 0.90; 95% CI 0.72-1.12) compared to those without MRI.Our findings of no breast cancer-specific or all-cause mortality benefit supplement prior results that indicate a lack of improvement in surgical outcomes associated with use of preoperative MRI. In combination with other reports, the results of this analysis highlight the importance of exploring the benefit of preoperative MRI in patient-reported outcomes such as women's decision quality and confidence levels with decisions involving treatment choices.",
  "Several studies have evaluated the role of delayed initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) in breast cancer (BC), but the results have remained controversial and an optimal time has not been defined. Our aim was to determine the effect of time to starting AC from the date of surgery on survival of BC patients, based on estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, using data from the National Cancer Database (NCDB).A total of 332,927 Stage I-III BC patients who received AC from 2010 to 2016 were analyzed. We included all ER, PR and HER2 statuses and excluded patients with stage 4 and stage 0 (DCIS) disease. The cohort was divided into five groups based on the time of initiating AC from the date of the most definitive surgery i.e., \u2264\u200930\u00a0days, 31-60\u00a0days, 61-90\u00a0days, 91-120\u00a0days and\u2009>\u2009120\u00a0days. They were further divided into five subgroups based on the receptor status.Hazard ratio (HR) estimates and Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis shows that starting AC by 31-60\u00a0days shows the best survival outcome in all the subtypes, except in hormone positive/HER2 negative BC in which 31-60\u00a0days and 61-90\u00a0days have similar outcomes.After surgery for BC, it takes around 4-6\u00a0weeks to begin AC and delay in initiating the same leads to poor outcomes. Our results are particularly significant in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), similar to prior studies showing a benefit to starting AC as early as possible after surgery.",
  "The activities of the ephrin family in breast cancer (BrCa) are complex. Family A receptors (EPHA) and ligands (EFNA) can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors and are implicated in chemoresistance. Here, we examined the expression pattern and prognostic value of the EPHA/EFNA family in patients with breast cancer, including patients with different subtypes or different chemotherapy cohorts. In the UALCAN database, the mRNA expression of EPHA1, EPHA10, EFNA1, EFNA3, and EFNA4 was significantly higher, whereas that of EPHA2, EPHA4, EPHA5, and EFNA5 was significantly lower in breast cancer tissues than in paracancerous tissues. The transcriptional levels of EPHA/EFNA family members were correlated with intrinsic subclasses of breast cancer. The relationship between EPHA/EFNA and the clinicopathological parameters of BrCa was analyzed using bc-GenExMiner V4.5. EPHA1, EPHA2, EPHA4, EPHA7, EFNA3, EFNA4, and EFNA5 were upregulated in estrogen receptor- (ER-) and progesterone receptor- (PR-) negative tumors, whereas EPHA3, EPHA6, and EFNA1 were upregulated in ER- and PR-positive tumors. EPHA1, EPHA2, EFNA3, and EFNA4 mRNA expression was significantly higher in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2- (HER2-) positive tumors than in HER2-negative tumors. Triple-negative status was positively correlated with EPHA1, EPHA2, EPHA4, EPHA7, EFNA3, EFNA4, and EFNA5 and negatively correlated with EPHA3 and EPHA10 mRNA expression. Genetic alterations of EPHA/EFNA in breast cancer varied from 1.1% to 10% for individual genes, as determined by the cBioPortal database. The Kaplan-Meier plotter indicated that high EphA7 mRNA expression was associated with poor overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS), especially in the HER2 and luminal A subtypes. EFNA4 was predicted to have poor OS and RFS in breast cancers, especially in luminal B, basal-like subtype, and patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. High EPHA3 expression was significantly associated with better OS and RFS, especially in the luminal A subtype, but with poor RFS in BrCa patients receiving chemotherapy. Our findings systematically elucidate the expression pattern and prognostic value of the EPHA/EFNA family in BrCa, which might provide potential prognostic factors and novel targets in BrCa patients, including those with different subtypes or treated with chemotherapy.",
  "The functions of the specific genes involved in the three types of breast cancer (BC) are unclear.A total of 53,805 genes were assessed from the RNA-sequencing database of BC cells and classified into those involved in hormonal positive (HR+) BC and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Overall, distant metastasis-free, and relapse-free survival obtained from the Breast Cancer Gene-Expression Miner database containing 13,603 human breast cancer patient samples were assessed for gene associations using the RNA-sequencing database. To examine cell invasion and cytokine levels, inflammation-related genes were knocked down. The role of inflammation in cancer metastasis was confirmed using inflammatory inhibitors in a three-dimensional organoid ex vivo.Genes affecting inflammation and cancer metastasis were highly expressed in TNBC, unlike HR+ BC. The A20/TNFAIP3-CDC20-CASP1 axis, which includes inflammation-related genes found in TNBC, was associated with poor patient prognosis, cancer metastasis, and cytokine levels. Inflammation inhibitors prevented the metastasis of aggressive TNBC.The A20/TNFAIP3-CDC20-CASP1 axis is closely related to the metastatic potential of TNBC, and inflammation inhibitors might be a novel target therapy for TNBC.",
  "This study assessed whether prognostic information could be obtained in patients with lymph node (LN)-positive breast cancer based on their LN ratios (LNRs) and explored the relationships between other potential prognostic factors and survival.This was a retrospective clinical study.This study included 608 women with node-positive nonmetastatic breast cancer. Clinical and pathologic data were retrospectively evaluated. The median age was 51 years (range: 23-84 years). All patients received adjuvant radiotherapy after radical surgery. A total dose of 50 Gy was administered to the chest wall or breast and LN regions with 2 Gy daily fractions. A 10-Gy boost was administered to the breast tumor bed. The cutoff value of LNR was defined as low risk (<0.21) in 278 patients, intermediate risk (0.21-0.65) in 217 patients, and high risk (>0.65) in 113 patients. Prognostic variables included patient characteristics, disease characteristics, and interventional factors. The primary endpoint was overall survival and the secondary endpoint was breast cancer-related mortality.Statistical analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox regression analysis. P value was required to be <0.05.Within a median follow-up period of 95.4 months (range: 5-232.4 months), overall survival rates for 10 and 15 years were 66% and 53%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that LNR (P = 0.026), estrogen receptor status (ERS) (P = 0.021), age (P = 0.04), and smoking (P = 0.024) were independent significant prognostic factors for overall survival. Breast cancer-related mortality rates at 10 and 15 years were 70.7% and 60%, respectively. LNR (P = 0.03) and ERS (P = 0.002) were independent significant prognostic factors for breast cancer-related mortality.LNR and ERS were significant prognostic factors for survival at all endpoints.",
  "Molecular profiling of breast cancer (BC) classifies several intrinsic subtypes based on different patterns of gene expression. Multigene assays estimate the risk of recurrence and help to select high-risk patients for adjuvant chemotherapy. However, these tests are associated with significant costs. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) offers a surrogate classification for molecular subtypes by determining estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR), human epidermal growth factor (Her2neu), as well as the proliferation marker Ki67. Core needle biopsy (CNB) is well established in BC diagnosis and allows a pre-operative assessment of biomarkers. The aim of this study was to analyze the concordance of these markers between CNB and surgical specimens to assess whether re-testing of the surgical specimen is mandatory.Within a 3-year period, patients with primary BC and paired samples of CNB and surgical specimens were analyzed retrospectively. Concordance rates of ER, PR, Her2neu, Ki67, and the surrogate classification for molecular subtypes were calculated using the Landis and Koch agreement grades.Out of 2254 patients with primary breast cancer, 1307 paired specimens without pre-operative treatment were available for analysis Concordance rates for ER, PR, Her2neu, and Ki67 status showed substantial-to-almost perfect agreement grades (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.91, 0.75, 0.89, and 0.61, respectively). Though substantial concordance was also found for the subtype classification (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.70), the molecular subtype changed in 18.5% of patients based on the testing of the surgical specimen, mainly from luminal A-like to luminal B-like.Though the concordance rates for single markers were convincing, a significant proportion of the molecular subtypes differed between CNB and the surgical specimen. Re-testing of PR and Ki67 is mandatory to ensure optimal treatment decisions. Further research is necessary to define safe, efficient, and cost-effective predictive models in adjuvant breast cancer therapy.",
  "The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate outcomes of surgery compared to primary endocrine therapy (PET) in patients with non-advanced, operable invasive breast cancer, and to determine if PET as initial therapy may safely postpone surgery.The MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane Library were searched from database inception to July 2020 to identify eligible studies. Inclusion criteria were experimental or observational studies with at least one arm treated with PET and a second arm treated with surgery with or without PET. Local recurrence or progression of disease was defined as either failure of non-operative management (tumor failing to decrease in size and/or continuous local or distant tumor growth) or relapse of breast tumor after tumor downsizing following PET. Effect estimates were expressed in hazard ratio and 95% confidence intervals (HR (95% CI)).The analysis included six studies with 1499 unique patients. The median time to local progression of disease was 2.3\u00a0years. Patients treated with PET alone without surgery had a higher risk of local recurrence and or progression [HR (95% CI): 1.76 (1.33, 2.31); I<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u200984%; p\u2009<\u20090.001]. Patients treated with PET had more favorable outcomes in terms of overall survival [HR (95% CI): 1.24 (1.06, 1.46); I<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u200970%; p\u2009=\u20090.008] and less favorable outcomes in breast cancer-specific survival [HR (95% CI): 1.13 (0.98, 1.31); I<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u200941%; p\u2009=\u20090.10]. The risk of publication bias was assessed to be high in reporting local recurrence rates and low in reporting distant recurrence rates.PET alone is inferior to surgery in the treatment of operable invasive breast cancer. However, it may be acceptable to postpone curative breast cancer surgery without risk of progression for 1.1\u00a0years or longer.",
  "Oncotype DX (ODX) is a multi-gene expression signature designed for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer patients to predict the recurrence score (RS) and chemotherapy (CT) benefit. The aim of our study is to develop a prediction tool for the three RS's categories based on deep multi-layer perceptrons (DMLP) and using only the morphoimmunohistological variables. We performed a retrospective cohort of 320 patients who underwent ODX testing from three French hospitals. Clinico-pathological characteristics were recorded. We built a supervised machine learning classification model using Matlab software with 152 cases for the training and 168 cases for the testing. Three classifiers were used to learn the three risk categories of the ODX, namely the low, intermediate, and high risk. Experimental results provide the area under the curve (AUC), respectively, for the three risk categories: 0.63 [95% confidence interval: (0.5446, 0.7154), p\u2009<\u20090.001], 0.59 [95% confidence interval: (0.5031, 0.6769), p\u2009<\u20090.001], 0.75 [95% confidence interval: (0.6184, 0.8816), p\u2009<\u20090.001]. Concordance rate between actual RS and predicted RS ranged from 53 to 56% for each class between DMLP and ODX. The concordance rate of low and intermediate combined risk group was 85%.We developed a predictive machine learning model that could help to define patient's RS. Moreover, we integrated histopathological data and DMLP results to select tumor for ODX testing. Thus, this process allows more relevant use of histopathological data, and optimizes and enhances this information.",
  "Pregnancy-associated breast cancer, although most commonly defined as breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy or\u2009\u22641\u00a0year following delivery, knows a variety of definitions, likely related to the diversity of reported clinicopathological features and prognosis. More insight into the different breast cancer subgroups during pregnancy, time after delivery and the postpartum period is therefore warranted.Patients with breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy or\u2009\u22646\u00a0months postdelivery were included, and subdivided according to gestational trimester, and postpartum patients according to lactational status. Subgroups were compared to matched non-PABC patients, to investigate the influence of pregnancy and lactation on clinical course and outcome.Overall, 662 PABC patients were included (median age 34\u00a0years, median follow-up 6.5\u00a0years). PABC patients showed an advanced stage at diagnosis and an inferior 5-years-OS (75.4% vs. 83.2%, p\u2009=\u20090.000) compared to 1392 matched non-PABC patients. In subgroup analysis, first trimester PABC patients showed a significantly lower tumor size and stage as compared to other trimesters. Patients diagnosed during the first trimester and postpartum non-lactating patients had a relatively good OS (81.3% and 77.9%, respectively) versus patients diagnosed during the second and third trimesters and during lactation (OS 60.0%, 64.9% and 65.6%, respectively, p\u2009=\u20090.003).In this large (uniquely specified) PABC cohort, an inferior outcome was found for patients diagnosed within the second and third gestational trimesters and during lactation. These findings indicate that PABC is clinically a heterogeneous group of breast cancer patients that should be redefined based on trimester of diagnosis and lactational status.",
  "To examine the proportion of older women with ER\u2009+\u2009HER2- breast cancer receiving non-operative management versus surgery, and to evaluate the use of axillary staging and adjuvant radiation in this population.We queried the SEER database to identify all women aged 70\u00a0years or older with stage I-III ER\u2009+\u2009HER2- invasive breast cancer diagnosed between 2010 and 2016. We evaluated trends in non-operative management, breast surgery, axillary staging, and adjuvant radiation according to age at diagnosis.We identified 57,351 older women with ER\u2009+\u2009HER2- disease. Overall, 3538 (6.2%) of the cohort underwent non-operative management, 38,452 (67.0%) underwent breast-conserving surgery (BCS), and 15,361 (26.8%) underwent mastectomy. The proportion of patients undergoing non-operative management increased from 2.8% among 70-74-year-old women to 30.1% in those\u2009\u2265\u200990\u00a0years old (p\u2009<\u20090.001). In 53,813 women who underwent surgery, 36,850 (68.5%) underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy, while 10,861 (20.2%) underwent axillary lymph node dissection. Subgroup analysis of 29,032 older women undergoing BCS for stage I ER\u2009+\u2009HER2- breast cancer revealed a 14.2% rate of omission of axillary staging, increasing from 5.3% in those 70-74\u00a0years to 67.6% in those\u2009\u2265\u200990\u00a0years old (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Receipt of adjuvant radiation occurred in 63.3% of older women following BCS and 18% post-mastectomy, with similar trends towards omission in older age groups.Primary breast surgery remains the dominant management strategy for the majority of older women with ER\u2009+\u2009HER2- breast cancer. Omission of axillary staging and adjuvant radiation are used in a minority of eligible women undergoing breast conservation for early-stage disease.",
  "Due to its rarity, few studies have characterized the epidemiology of male breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine survival and risk factors for male breast cancer in a large U.S.In this study, 19,795 male patients with breast cancer were identified from the National Cancer Database (2004-2014). Patient demographics, tumor characteristics and treatments were analyzed by using descriptive statistics. We used multivariate Cox regression and Kaplan Meier analysis.Over 10 years, the incidence of male breast cancer increased from 7.2% to 10.3%, while mortality decreased from 11% to 3.8%. Socioeconomic factors predicting mortality included income medium, and high vs low (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.78; 0.68), private vs no insurance (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.73) and the academic research facility vs community cancer center (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.79). Significant predictors of all-cause mortality included age (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.04), tumor size (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.01), hormone receptor expression (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.8) and cancer stage I vs II, III, and IV at the time of diagnosis (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.5, 2.7, 4.4, 9.9 respectively). Other predictors of mortality include surgery (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.4), chemotherapy (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.8), radiation (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.8), and hormonal therapy (HR-0.8).Socioeconomic factors, cancer stage, tumor characteristics (size and grade), and high Charlson-Dayo score contributed to higher mortality among male patients diagnosed with breast cancer. Surgery was most effective, followed by radiation, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy. Patients with positive ER or PR expression demonstrated better survival. Adjusting for socioeconomic factors, biomarker identification and timely, appropriately chosen treatment are likely to reduce the risk for mortality.",
  "Women who carry germ-line mutations in BRCA1/2 are at very high risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. Breast conserving therapy is associated with a similar risk of ipsilateral cancer recurrence in BRCA carriers compared with non-carriers. However, the risk of subsequent contralateral breast cancer in carriers is markedly increased. Therefore, mastectomy of the diseased breast along with risk reducing mastectomy of the contralateral breast is often advocated for BRCA carriers who are treated for early breast cancer. Yet, many BRCA carriers forgo this option for fear of harmful effects and choose breast conserving treatment and observation instead. In Israel, BRCA-associated breast cancer is relatively common. Accordingly, a national protocol was devised for this enriched population.In this Institutional Review Board-approved phase II trial, the option of prophylactic irradiation to the contralateral breast, in addition to standard loco-regional treatment, was offered to BRCA carrier patients treated for early breast cancer who declined contralateral mastectomy. The primary end point was contralateral breast cancer.Between May 2007 and October 2017, 162 patients were enrolled. Eighty-one patients opted for standard loco-regional treatment including surgery and radiation to the involved side (control arm) and 81 patients chose additional contralateral breast irradiation (intervention arm). At a median follow-up of 58\u2009months, 10 patients developed contralateral breast cancer in the control arm at a median of 32\u2009months, as compared with 2 patients in the intervention arm who developed contralateral breast cancer 80 and 105\u2009months after bilateral breast irradiation (log-rank P\u2009=\u20090.011).Among BRCA carrier patients treated for early breast cancer, the addition of contralateral breast irradiation was associated with a significant reduction of subsequent contralateral breast cancers and a delay in their onset.Phase II, comparative two-arm trial (NCT00496288).",
  "Circadian disruption may play a role in breast carcinogenesis. Previous studies reported relationships between outdoor light at night (LAN) and the breast cancer risk, but their findings are mixed. There is also a need to examine LAN and breast cancer incidence according to different individual and environmental characteristics to identify subpopulations at greater risk associated with LAN exposure. We studied residential outdoor LAN estimated from satellite imagery at baseline (1996) in relation to postmenopausal breast cancer incidence over ~16\u2009years of follow-up in 186\u2009981 postmenopausal women including 12\u2009318 incident postmenopausal breast cancer cases in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the relationship between quintiles of LAN and postmenopausal breast cancer risk, overall and by hormone receptor status and cancer stage. We found that when compared to women in the lowest quintile of baseline LAN, those in the highest quintile had a 10% increase in postmenopausal breast cancer risk (HR (95% CI), 1.10 (1.02, 1.18), P-trend, .002). The association appeared to be stronger for estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer (1.12 [1.02, 1.24], .007) than for ER-negative cancer (1.07 [0.85, 1.34], .66). Our findings also suggested that the relationship between LAN and breast cancer risk may differ by individual characteristics, such as smoking, alcohol drinking, sleep duration and BMI, and neighborhood environment. In conclusion, our study suggests that higher outdoor LAN exposure may be a risk factor for postmenopausal breast cancer.",
  "Breast cancer chemoresistance is attributed to a wide variety of mechanisms, including autophagy. Transcription factor EB (TFEB) has been recently identified and characterized as one major regulator of autophagy and lysosomal genesis.This study aims to evaluate the prognostic impact of TFEB and its pathway in breast cancer chemoresistance.This retrospective study analyzes the expression of TFEB, CARM1, SIRT1, and Beclin-1 and the methylation of PITX2 in breast carcinoma. A group of breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy, who relapsed within 12\u2009months from treatment initiation, were compared to a sub-cohort of chemo-treated patients who did not recur within 12\u2009months of follow-up. The expression of TFEB, CARM1, SIRT1, and Belcin-1 was analyzed using immunohistochemistry or RT-PCR on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples. PITX2 methylation was tested with the diagnostic CE-marked kit Therascreen PITX2 RGQ PCR. In the final model, 136 cases of chemo-treated breast cancer were included.A higher TFEB and Beclin-1 expression correlate with shorter survival in patients with chemo-treated invasive breast cancer (respectively HR 3.46, CI.95 1.27-9.47, p\u00a0<\u20090.05 and 7.11, CI.95 2.54-19.9). TFEB, CARM1, and SIRT1 are positively correlated with Beclin-1. The protein expression of SIRT1 is significantly associated with TFEB and CARM1 so that a very low SIRT1 expression (lower than the first quartile of the H-score distribution) correlates with a low expression of TFEB and CARM1 and with longer survival. SIRT1 seems to have a lower H-score in the basal-like and HER2-enriched tumors than the luminal subtypes. Beclin-1 and TFEB seem to have a higher H-score in the basal-like and HER2-enriched tumors than the luminal subtypes. PITX2 methylation analysis was feasible only in 65% of the selected samples, but no significant differences between cases and controls were found, and there was also no correlation with the expression of the TFEB pathway.TFEB, SIRT1, and Beclin-1 seem to have a potential prognostic significance in patients with chemo-treated breast cancer, likely because of their role in the regulation of autophagy. In addition, no correlation between TFEB and PITX2 methylation was found, likely because they perform two different roles within the autophagy process.",
  "<b>Purpose:</b> The function of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) in breast cancer metastasis remains largely unknown. In this work, the role of HOXC-AS3 in breast cancer progression was investigated.<b>Methods:</b> By using Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Database, we investigated the expression of HOXC-AS3 in breast cancer and explored the association between HOXC-AS3 expression and prognosis. Then, we studied the biological function of HOXC-AS3 in cell migration and invasion both <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> and <i>in\u00a0vivo</i>. Furthermore, the target miRNA of HOXC-AS3, and the target mRNA of miR-3922-5p were proved.<b>Results:</b> HOXC-AS3 is aberrantly overexpressed in breast cancers especially the HER2<b><sup>+</sup></b> type. Moreover, high expression of HOXC-AS3 has a relationship with poor clinical outcomes of breast cancer. In addition, HOXC-AS3 regulates cell Invasion and migration both <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> and <i>in\u00a0vivo</i>. Our results demonstrated that miR-3922-5p was a direct target of HOXC-AS3, and PPP1R1A was a target of miR-3922-5p in breast cancer.<b>Conclusions:</b> The novel lncRNA HOXC-AS3 acts as a miR-3922-5p sponge to upregulate PPP1R1A protein expression, and thus results in promoting breast cancer metastasis. HOXC-AS3 could be a novel therapeutic target for breast cancer therapeutics.",
  "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from tumor cells are implicated in the progression of malignancies through the transfer of molecular cargo microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs). We aimed to explore the role of EVs derived from breast cancer cells carrying miR-182-5p in the occurrence and development of breast cancer.Differentially expressed miRNAs and their downstream target genes related to breast cancer were screened through GEO and TCGA databases. miR-182-5p expression was examined in cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues from patients with breast cancer. EVs were isolated from breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 cells and identified. The gain- and loss-of function approaches of miR-182-5p and CKLF-like MARVEL transmembrane domain-containing 7 (CMTM7) were performed in MDA-MB-231 cells and the isolated EVs. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were subjected to co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived EVs and biological behaviors were detected by CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, immunohistochemical staining, Transwell assay and vessel-like tube formation in vitro. A xenograft mouse model in nude mice was established to observe the tumorigenesis and metastasis of breast cancer cells in vivo.miR-182-5p was highly expressed in breast cancer tissues and cells, and this high expression was associated with poor prognosis of breast cancer patients. miR-182-5p overexpression was shown to promote tumor angiogenesis in breast cancer. Moreover, our data indicated that miR-182-5p was highly enriched in EVs from MDA-MD-231 cells and then ultimately enhanced the proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis of HUVECs in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we found that CMTM7 is a target of miR-182-5p. EVs-miR-182-5p promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis of breast cancer cells by regulating the CMTM7/EGFR/AKT signaling axis.Taken altogether, our findings demonstrates that EVs secreted by breast cancer cells could carry miR-182-5p to aggravate breast cancer through downregulating CMTM7 expression and activating the EGFR/AKT signaling pathway.",
  "The diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer can have profound effects on a young woman's family planning and fertility, particularly among women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.The Young Women's Breast Cancer Study was a multicenter cohort of women aged 40 years or younger and newly diagnosed with breast cancer from 2006 to 2016. Surveys included assessments of fertility concerns, endocrine therapy (ET) preferences, and use. Characteristics were compared between women who reported that fertility concerns affected ET decisions and those who did not. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with having an ET decision affected by fertility concerns.Of 643 eligible women with hormone receptor-positive, stage I to III breast cancer, one-third (213 of 643) indicated that fertility concerns affected ET decisions. In a multivariable analysis, only parity at diagnosis was significantly associated with fertility concerns affecting ET decisions (odds ratio for nulliparous vs \u22652 children, 6.96; 95% confidence interval, 4.09-11.83; odds ratio for 1 vs \u22652 children, 5.30; 95% confidence interval, 3.03-9.87). Noninitiation/nonpersistence was higher among women with fertility concerns versus those without fertility concerns (40% vs 20%; P < .0001). Among women with fertility-related ET concerns, 7% (15 of 213) did not initiate ET, and 33% (70 of 213) were nonpersistent over 5 years of follow-up. Of these women, 66% (56 of 85) reported 1 or more pregnancies or pregnancy attempts; 27% (15 of 56) had resumed ET at the last available follow-up through 5 years.Concern about fertility is a contributor to adjuvant ET decisions among a substantial proportion of young breast cancer survivors. Ensuring family planning is addressed in the setting of ET recommendations should be a priority throughout the cancer care continuum.",
  "The body mass index (BMI) is commonly used as a simple indicator of obesity; patients with early-stage breast cancer who are obese (OB) per BMI measurements have been shown to have high postoperative recurrence and low survival rates. On the other hand, it has been shown that lymphocytes present in the vicinity of malignant growths that are involved in the tumors' immune responses influence the efficacy chemotherapy. Therefore, we hypothesized that OB patients with breast cancer have a lower density of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), which may influence the therapeutic effect of preoperative chemotherapy (POC). In this study, we measured pretreatment BMI and TILs in patients with breast cancer who underwent POC, examined the correlations between these two factors, and retrospectively analyzed their therapeutic outcomes and prognoses.The participants in this study were 421 patients with breast cancer who underwent surgical treatment after POC between February 2007 and January 2019. The patient's height and weight were measured before POC to calculate the BMI (weight [kg] divided by the square of the height [m<sup>2</sup>]). According to the World Health Organization categorization, patients who weighed under 18.5\u2009kg/m<sup>2</sup> were classified as underweight (UW), those \u226518.5\u2009kg/m<sup>2</sup> and\u2009>\u200925\u2009kg/m<sup>2</sup> were considered normal weight (NW), those \u226525\u2009kg/m<sup>2</sup> and\u2009<\u200930\u2009kg/m<sup>2</sup> were overweight (OW), and those \u226530\u2009kg/m<sup>2</sup> were OB. The TILs were those lymphocytes that infiltrated the tumor stroma according to the definition of the International TILs Working Group 2014.The median BMI was 21.9\u2009kg/m<sup>2</sup> (range, 14.3-38.5\u2009kg/m<sup>2</sup>); most patients (244; 64.5%) were NW. Among all 378 patients with breast cancer, the TIL density was significantly lower in OB than in NW and OW patients (vs. NW: p\u2009=\u20090.001; vs. OW: p\u2009=\u20090.003). Furthermore, when examining patients with each breast cancer type individually, the OS of those with TNBC who had low BMIs was significantly poorer than that of their high-BMI counterparts (log rank p\u2009=\u20090.031).Our data did not support the hypothesis that obesity affects the tumor immune microenvironment; however, we showed that being UW does affect the tumor immune microenvironment.",
  "Breast cancer (BC) patients' (pts) management was affected by a global reorganization after Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our multicenter study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on access to diagnosis, staging and treatment for BC pts compared to pre-pandemic.Medical records of all consecutive newly diagnosed BC pts referred to 6 Italian Institutions between March and December 2020 were assessed. Monthly access rate and temporal intervals between date of symptoms onset, radiological, cytohistological diagnosis and treatment start were analyzed and compared with 2019.A reduction (25%) in newly diagnosed BC was observed compared to 2019 (666 vs 890). New BC pts in 2020 were less likely to be diagnosed with early stage BC (77% vs 83%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), had a worse performance status according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG PS) (19.8% had PS\u00a0>\u00a00 in 2020 vs 16.5% in 2019, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and fewer pts were asymptomatic at diagnosis in 2020 (54% vs 71%,p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). COVID-19 did not negatively impact in terms of access to diagnosis, staging and treatment. Time intervals between symptom onset and radiological diagnosis, symptom onset and cytohistological diagnosis, cytohistological diagnosis and treatment start were maintained or improved. However, less cases were discussed in multidisciplinary tumor meetings during 2020 (60% vs 73%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).Our data proved an alarming reduction of early stage BC associated with the COVID-19 crisis in 2020. Despite the upheaval generated by the pandemic, our study shed light on the effective performance delivered by Italian Oncology Departments to guarantee diagnostic-therapeutic pathways.",
  "Breast cancer is not preventable. To reduce the death rate and improve the survival chances of breast cancer patients, early and accurate detection is the only panacea. Delay in diagnosis of this disease causes 60% of deaths. Thermal imaging is a low-risk modality for early breast cancer decision making without injecting any form of energy into the human body. Thermography as a screening tool was first introduced and well accepted in 1956. However, a study in 1977 found that it lagged behind other screening tools and is subjective. Soon after, its use was discontinued. This review discusses various screening tools used to detect breast cancer with a focus on thermography along with their advantages and shortcomings. With the maturation of thermography equipment and technological advances, this technique is emerging and has become the refocus of many biomedical researchers across the globe in the past decade. This study dispenses an exhaustive review of the work done related to interpretation of breast thermal variations and confers the discipline, frameworks, and methodologies used by different authors to diagnose breast cancer. Different performance metrics like accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity have also been examined. This paper outlines the most pressing research gaps for future work to improvise the accuracy of results for diagnosis of breast abnormalities using image processing tools, mathematical modelling and artificial intelligence. However, supplementary research is needed to affirm the potential of this technology for predicting breast cancer risk effectively. Altogether, our findings inform that it is a promising research problem and a potential solution for early detection of breast cancer in younger women.",
  "Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) is overexpressed in 20-25% of breast cancers. Complete eradication of disease following neoadjuvant therapies and chemotherapy has been referred to as pathological complete response (pCR).To determine clinicopathological predictors of pCR to neoadjuvant therapies and to evaluate pCR as a surrogate to enhanced survival.Consecutive female patients with HER2 positive (HER+) breast cancer managed surgically in a single institution between 2005 and 2015 were included. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were used to determine predictors of pCR. Appraisal of pCR as a predictor of survival was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analysis.451 patients were included with a mean age of 56.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.4 years (range 23-95). Disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) was 82.3% (371/451) and 82.6% (376/451) respectively with a median follow-up of 108.0 months (range 3-184.0). 118 were treated in the neoadjuvant setting (26.2%): tumour size <50\u00a0mm (Odds Ratio (OR): 12.156, P\u00a0=\u00a00.023) and progesterone receptor negativity (OR: 2.762, P\u00a0=\u00a00.008) independently predicted breast pCR, while ductal carcinoma (OR: 3.203, P\u00a0=\u00a00.030) and grade 3 disease (OR: 2.788, P\u00a0=\u00a00.018) predicted axillary pCR. Both breast and axillary pCR predicted enhanced DFS (Hazard Ratio (HR): 0.470 & HR: 0.449) and OS (HR: 0.383 & HR: 0.307). Axillary pCR independently predicted improved OS (HR: 0.326).pCR is sensitive biomarker and surrogate to survival outcomes in HER2+ breast cancer. Patients likely to achieve pCR may be predicted from traditional clinicopathological characteristics and molecular parameters.",
  "Immune responses play an important role in interrupting the progression of cancer cells. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are basic components of the immune system. In triple negative breast cancer, increased number of TILs is associated with excellent prognosis and response of chemotherapy. Here, we investigated whether TILs affect the efficacy of trastuzumab-based treatment in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer.The study included 97 patients with stage I-III HER2-positive breast cancer. All patients were preoperatively treated with an anthracycline-based combination regimen, followed by taxane with trastuzumab from 2009 to 2013. Pathological complete response (pCR) was defined as the disappearance of invasive cancer cells regardless of the presence of in situ components. TILs were evaluated using pre-therapeutic needle biopsy specimens. We assessed the percentage of the breast stroma with TILs over the total intratumoral stroma and classified the specimens in three grades: TILs1+ <\u00a030%, TILs2+ 30-50%, and TILs3+ >\u00a050%.Overall, 80.4% of the specimens were TILs1+, 15.5% were TILs2+ and 4.1% were TILs3+. The pCR rate was 44.9% (35/78) in the TILs1+ cases, 80.0% (12/15) in the TILs2+ cases and 75.0% (3/4) in the TILs3+ cases. TILs were significantly associated with pCR (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0228). Multivariate analysis using TILs, hormone receptor (HR), nuclear grade (NG) and age indicated that TILs (OR 4.32, 95% CI 1.04-23.33, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0436) and HR (OR 8.76, 95% CI 3.30-25.44, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) were independent predictors for pCR.TILs are associated with the efficacy of trastuzumab-based treatment in HER2-positive breast cancer.",
  "Compared to white women, Black women have increased risk of developing hypertensive diseases of pregnancy (HDOP) and have a higher incidence of aggressive breast cancer subtypes. Few studies of HDOP and breast cancer risk have included large numbers of Black women. This study examined the relation of HDOP to incidence of breast cancer overall and by estrogen receptor\u00a0(ER) status in Black women.We followed 42,982 parous women in the Black Women's Health Study, a nationwide prospective study of Black women. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess associations of self-reported HDOP, including preeclampsia and gestational hypertension, with breast cancer incidence overall and by ER subtype, adjusted for age and established breast cancer risk factors.Over 20\u00a0years of follow-up, we identified 2376 incident breast cancer cases. History of HDOP (11.7%) was not associated with breast cancer risk overall (HR 0.98; 95% CI 0.87, 1.11). HRs for invasive ER+\u2009and ER- breast cancer were 1.11 (95% CI 0.93, 1.34) and 0.81 (95% CI 0.61, 1.07), respectively.HDOP was not associated with risk of overall breast cancer in Black women. A suggestive inverse association with ER- breast cancer may reflect an anti-tumorigenic hormone profile in HDOP, but those results require confirmation in other studies.",
  "The Helen Joseph Hospital (HJH) breast clinic utilises a clinical triage system to stratify patients based on their risk of breast cancer into high-, medium-, or low-risk profiles. This allows for timeous imaging and subsequent management of those patients at increased risk for breast cancer. The primary objective was to determine the cancer detection rate (CDR). The secondary objective was to correlate biopsy results with the Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) risk assessment.A retrospective audit of the patients at low risk for breast cancer who were referred to the breast imaging unit (BIU) in 2019 at HJH. Patients were clinically assessed as low risk based on a triage form and were identified using the imaging files stored in the BIU. Results were recorded on Microsoft Excel and calculated as per the American College of Radiology guidelines.The total population sample consisted of 398 patients. Two patients were characterised as BI-RADS 4 and underwent breast biopsies. One patient was diagnosed with histologically proven breast cancer. The CDR was 2.51%. The most representative groups were the age group of 60-69 years, BI-RADS breast density B and BI-RADS risk assessment 2.Amongst the low-risk population, both the CDR and spectrum of disease was comparable to that of a screening population. This may be due to the use of a triage system prior to imaging, as well as an increase in clinical awareness of breast cancer within a tertiary institution.",
  "Breast cancer has been known as cancer with high mortality rates. It has been studied that MEX3A (Mex-3 RNA Binding Family Member A) is involved in carcinogenesis by accelerating cancer proliferation and migration. Therefore, this research aimed to study how MEX3A regulates the biological behaviors of breast cancer. Firstly, we used GEPIA and KM-plotter databases to evaluate MEX3A expression in human breast cancer tissue compared to adjacent normal tissue. Immunohistochemistry was employed to assess MEX3A protein expression in clinical specimens. MEX3A mRNA expression level was assessed through quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). Western blotting was used to detect protein expression. Moreover, Cell Count Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, wound healing assay and transwell invasion assay were used to determine the proliferation, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells, respectively. Our study found that MEX3A expression level was much higher in human breast cancer tissues as compared to adjacent normal tissues. Similarly, breast cancer cell lines showed higher expression of MEX3A as compared to the normal breast cells. This higher expression of MEX3A was linked with the poor survival of breast cancer. Moreover, we found that overexpression of MEX3A stimulated proliferation and migration in the breast cancer cells. However, inhibition of MEX3A significantly reduced the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. In addition, we determined that MEX3A could activate RhoA/ROCK1/LIMK1 signaling in the breast cancer cells. Overall, our study concluded that MEX3A promotes its migration and proliferation in breast cancer cells via modulating RhoA/ROCK1/LIMK1 signaling pathway.",
  "Epigenetic modifications are known to regulate cell phenotype during cancer progression, including breast cancer. Unlike genetic alterations, changes in the epigenome are reversible, thus potentially reversed by epi-drugs. Breast cancer, the most common cause of cancer death worldwide in women, encompasses multiple histopathological and molecular subtypes. Several lines of evidence demonstrated distortion of the epigenetic landscape in breast cancer. Interestingly, mammary cells isolated from breast cancer patients and cultured ex vivo maintained the tumorigenic phenotype and exhibited aberrant epigenetic modifications. Recent studies indicated that the therapeutic efficiency for breast cancer regimens has increased over time, resulting in reduced mortality. Future medical treatment for breast cancer patients, however, will likely depend upon a better understanding of epigenetic modifications. The present review aims to outline different epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and ncRNAs with their impact on breast cancer, as well as to discuss studies highlighting the central role of epigenetic mechanisms in breast cancer pathogenesis. We propose new research areas that may facilitate locus-specific epigenome editing as breast cancer therapeutics.",
  "We aimed to explore the function and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) pathway of MAFG-AS1 in breast cancer.qRT-PCR assay identified the expression of MAFG-AS1, miR-3612 and FKBP4. We used Western blot analysis to test the autophagy related protein levels in breast cancer cells. Functional assays such as Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay, BrdU proliferation assay, Caspase-3 activity detection were used to identify the function of MAFG-AS1, miR-3612 and FKBP4 in breast cancer cells. Mechanism assays were used to verify the interacting relationship among MAFG-AS1, miR-3612 and FKBP4, including RNA pull down assay, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay and luciferase reporter assay.MAFG-AS1 and FKBP4 were both up-regulated in breast cancer tissues. MAFG-AS1 could function as an oncogene in breast cancer to activate cell proliferation, and inhibit cell apoptosis and autophagy. Meanwhile, MAFG-AS1 could sponge miR-3612 to elevate the expression of FKBP4. Besides, FKBP4 could activate the cell proliferation and inhibit cell apoptosis and autophagy, which could relieve the inhibitory effect of miR-3612 on breast cancer cells.MAFG-AS1 could activate breast cancer progression via modulating miR-3612/FKBP4 axis in\u00a0vitro.",
  "To evaluate patient-reported work ability of breast cancer patients, to compare scores with the Dutch general population, and to identify determinants of reduced work ability in breast cancer patients.In a prospective cohort study, we identified 939 patients <67 years. Employed patients filled out the Work Ability Index (WAI) questionnaire before the start of radiotherapy treatment (baseline) and at 6, 18, and 30 months. Work ability was compared with a matched Dutch cancer-free population (n=3,641). The association between (clinical) characteristics and work ability over time was assessed using mixed-effects models.At baseline, 68% (n=641) of the respondents were employed and 64% (n=203) were employed at 30 months. Moderate or poor work ability was reported by 71% of patients at baseline, by 24% of the patients at 30 months and by 14% of the general population. Axillary lymph node dissection, (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy and locoregional radiotherapy were associated with reduced work ability. After 30 months, 18% of employed patients reported to have reduced their working hours, made substantial modifications to their work or were unable to work.Patient-reported work ability is strongly reduced during breast cancer treatment. Thirty months after treatment the proportion of women reporting poor or moderate work ability remains higher compared to the general population. Even though the proportion of women with paid employment is rather stable over time, substantial amendments in work are needed in 18% of patients. These findings emphasize the importance of informing patients on potential changes in work ability to allow shared decision making.",
  "Shenling Baizhu Powder (SBP), a famous Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulation, has been widely used in the adjuvant treatment of cancers, including breast cancer. This study aims to identify potential new targets for breast cancer treatment based on the network pharmacology of SBP.By analyzing the relationship between herbs and target proteins, potential targets of multiple herbs in SBP were identified by network pharmacology analysis. Besides, by comparing the data of breast cancer tissue with normal tissue, upregulated genes in two breast cancer expression profiles were found. Thereafter, the expression level and prognosis of activator of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) ATPase activity 1 (AHSA1) were further analyzed in breast cancer by bioinformatics analysis, and the network module of AHSA1 binding protein was constructed. Furthermore, the effect of knocking down AHSA1 on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of breast cancer cells was verified by MTT, clone formation assay, and transwell assay.Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 8 (CXCL8), AHSA1, and serpin family E member 1 (SERPINE1) were associated with multiple herbs in SBP. AHSA1 was remarkably upregulated in breast cancer tissues and positively correlated with poor overall survival and disease metastasis- free survival. Furthermore, knockdown of AHSA1 significantly inhibited the migration and invasion in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells but had no obvious effect on proliferation. In addition, among the proteins that bind to AHSAl, the network composed of proteasome, chaperonin, and heat shock proteins is closely connected, and these proteins are associated with poor prognosis in a variety of cancers.AHSA1 is positively correlated with breast cancer progression and might act as a novel therapeutic target for breast cancer.",
  "Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) confers increased cancer risk in either breast, but it remains unclear if this population is at increased risk for bilateral breast cancer (BC) development. Here we report bilateral BC incidence among women with a history of LCIS.Women with classic-type LCIS diagnosed from 1980 to 2017 who developed unilateral BC (UBC) or bilateral BC were identified. Bilateral BC was categorized as synchronous (bilateral BC diagnosed\u2009<\u20096\u00a0months apart; SBBC) or metachronous (bilateral BC diagnosed\u2009\u2265\u20096\u00a0months apart; MBBC). Five-year incidence rates of bilateral BC among this population were evaluated. Comparisons were made to identify factors associated with bilateral BC.At 7\u00a0years' median follow-up, 249/1651 (15%) women with LCIS developed BC; 34 with bilateral BC (2%). There were no clinicopathologic feature differences between those with UBC and bilateral BC. SBBC occurred in 18 without significant differences versus UBC. Among 211 with UBC and a contralateral breast at risk, 16 developed MBBC at a median follow-up of 3\u00a0years. MBBC patients were less likely to receive endocrine therapy and more likely to receive chemotherapy versus UBC. Tumor histology was not associated with MBBC. Estimated 5-year MBBC risk was 6.4%. Index estrogen/progesterone receptor positivity and endocrine therapy were the only factors associated with MBBC risk.Bilateral BC occurred in 2% of women with LCIS history at median follow-up of 7\u00a0years. Similar to the general BC population, a decrease in MBBC is seen among women with a history of LCIS who develop hormone receptor-positive disease and those who receive endocrine therapy, highlighting the protective effects of this treatment.",
  "Prognostic assessment and treatment of early breast cancer. Breast cancer is the most common cancer occurring in France and worldwide. In 2017 it has been estimated that 59.000 women in France have been diagnosed with breast cancer. Breast cancer prognosis depends on multiple factors: tumor stage (TNM), histology, molecular sub-type and grade. The treatment of early breast cancer usually involves different strategies, such as surgery, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, targeted therapies and radiotherapy, on the basis of the different sub-types.",
  "In recent years, with the emphasis on breast cancer screening and the improvement of standardized diagnosis and treatment, cure rate and survival time of breast cancer patients have been significantly improved in China. Accompanied by prolonged follow-up period, patients are facing increasing cancer and other related health issues, which calls for a more accurate and long-term follow-up plan and focus on broader health risks. Health issues on cardiovascular system, bone density, blood lipid and psychology caused by anti-cancer treatment, senescence or changes in hormone levels have become new challenges in the management of patients with breast cancer, not only affecting the life quality, but also impacting disease recurrence and death. Therefore, in addition to standardized treatment, scientific and standardized follow-up, comprehensive management of patients' concomitant diseases, interdisciplinary cooperation and holistic rehabilitation are also vital links to treatment. This could improve the therapeutic efficacy of anti-cancer treatment and the quality of life of patients. Based on the current landscape of treatment and follow-up of breast cancer patients in China, the experts committee updated the \"Comprehensive Management Guideline for Breast Cancer Follow-up and Concomitant Diseases (2019 edition)\" and revised it as \"Guidelines for breast cancer follow-up and health management in China (2022 edition)\" according to the latest literature and guidelines and medical advice from interdisciplinary experts. This new guideline is composed of four parts: path diagram, follow-up management, comprehensive healthcare management, and patient reported outcome. It aims to standardize the long-term follow-up of breast cancer patients, guide clinicians to actively provide comprehensive interdisciplinary healthcare management, and further improve the prognosis and life quality of breast cancer patients in China.",
  "To verify whether omitting radiotherapy from breast cancer treatment for patients\u2009\u2265\u200970\u00a0years old following breast-conserving surgery (BCS) without axillary lymph node dissection is safe. Previous studies have shown that omitting breast radiotherapy after BCS and axillary lymph node dissection is safe for elderly breast cancer patients. We aimed to evaluate the safety of BCS without axillary surgery or breast radiotherapy (BCSNR) in elderly patients with breast cancer and clinically negative axillary lymph nodes. We performed a retrospective analysis of 481 patients with breast cancer, aged\u2009\u2265\u200970\u00a0years, between 2010 and 2016. Of these, 302 patients underwent BCSNR and 179 underwent other, larger scope operations. Local recurrence rate, ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) rate, distant metastasis rate, breast-related death, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were compared between the two groups. After a median follow-up of 60\u00a0months, no significant differences in local recurrence, distant metastasis rate, breast-related death, and DFS were noted. The OS was similar (P\u2009=\u20090.56) between the BCSNR group (91.7%) and other operations group (93.0%). The IBTR rate was considered low in both groups, however resulted greater (P\u2009=\u20090.005) in the BCSNR group (5.3%) than in other operations group (1.6%). BCSNR did not affect the survival of elderly patients with breast cancer with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes. IBTR was infrequent in both groups; however, there was a significant difference between the two groups. BCSNR is a feasible treatment modality for patients with breast cancer\u2009\u2265\u200970\u00a0years old with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes.",
  "Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women, and metastasis is the leading cause of death in breast cancer patients. Previous studies have shown that epithelial\u2011mesenchymal transition (EMT) is involved in the metastasis of breast cancer, but the metabolic reprogramming and regulation mechanisms involved in the EMT process are still unclear. In the present study, we successfully constructed an EMT cell model induced by transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF\u2011\u03b21) treatment of MCF\u20117 cells at different times. The results showed that cell adhesion decreased, cell invasion increased and ATP levels increased in EMT MCF\u20117 cells treated with TGF\u2011\u03b21. Furthermore, the expression of fatty acid synthase (FASN) was decreased, and the expression of key fatty acid \u03b2\u2011oxidation enzymes (CPT1 and CD36) was elevated in treated cells compared to control cells. These results showed that the fatty acid oxidation pathway was enhanced. In addition, the expression of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B8 (NDUFB8), mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COXI) increased, and the mitochondrial DNA copy number and ROS levels were also significantly increased during TGF\u2011\u03b21\u2011induced EMT. These results indicated that mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity was enhanced during EMT. In addition, we observed that the expression of p\u2011AMPK was increased and ACC (Acetyl\u2011CoA Carboxylase) was decreased during TGF\u2011\u03b21\u2011induced EMT in MCF\u20117 cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of clinical samples revealed high expression of FASN in epithelial cells that had high expression of E\u2011cadherin, while high expression of CPT\u20111 was observed in mesenchymal cells that had high expression of vimentin. Results of the current study showed a metabolic transition in TGF\u2011\u03b21\u2011induced EMT in MCF\u20117 cells. This transition may regulate fatty acid oxidation and OXPHOS activity in EMT MCF\u20117 cells through the p\u2011AMPK pathway. These data suggest that a metabolic transition that suppresses lipogenesis and favors energy production is an essential component of TGF\u2011\u03b21\u2011induced EMT and metastasis in breast cancer. This study thus provides a new strategy for identifying new therapeutic targets for breast cancer.",
  "An expanding body of research documents the benefits of physical activity for cancer survivors' physical functioning and quality of life, but few successful models provide community-based physical activity programs to cancer survivors. This report presents an evaluation of Active Living After Cancer, an evidence-based physical activity program for breast cancer survivors, adapted for community delivery to minority and medically underserved survivors.Survivors were recruited from health care and community settings. The program consisted of 12 weekly group sessions providing training in cognitive and behavioral skills for behavior change, brief physical activity, and cancer survivorship-related content. At the baseline and follow-up, participants completed assessments of their physical activity, quality of life, and physical functioning (6-minute walk and 30-second sit-to-stand test). At follow-up, they also completed questionnaires to measure program content mastery and satisfaction.The outcome analysis included 127 participants. Physical activity and quality of life (mental and physical) improved from the baseline to follow-up (all P < .01). Physical functioning improved, with increases in sit-to-stand repetitions (mean, 12.5 at the baseline vs 14.9 at the follow-up; P < .01) and 6-minute walk distances (mean, 428 m at the baseline vs 470 m at the follow-up; P < .01).The results highlight the effectiveness of an evidence-based program adapted for community-based delivery to minority and medically underserved breast cancer survivors. The program could be delivered to improve outcomes in diverse survivor populations.Physical activity in breast cancer survivors is related to better quality of life and longer cancer-free survival. However, there are few community-based programs to help breast cancer survivors to become more physically active. The Active Living After Cancer program was adapted from an evidence-based program and delivered in community-based settings to minority and medically underserved breast cancer survivors. It consisted of 12 weekly group sessions in which participants learned skills to increase their physical activity. The program participants increased their physical activity and improved their mental and physical well-being and physical functioning.",
  "Assessing the long-term risk of breast cancer after diagnosis of benign breast disease by mammography is of utmost importance to design personalised screening strategies. We analysed individual-level data from 778,306 women aged 50-69 years with at least one mammographic screening participation in any of ten breast cancer screening centers in Spain from 1996 to 2015, and followed-up until 2017. We used Poisson regression to compare the rates of incident breast cancer among women with and without benign breast disease. During a median follow-up of 7.6 years, 11,708 (1.5%) women had an incident of breast cancer and 17,827 (2.3%) had a benign breast disease. The risk of breast cancer was 1.77 times higher among women with benign breast disease than among those without (95% CI: 1.61 to 1.95). The relative risk increased to 1.99 among women followed for less than four years, and remained elevated for two decades, with relative risk 1.96 (95% CI: 1.32 to 2.92) for those followed from 12 to 20 years. Benign breast disease is a long-term risk factor for breast cancer. Women with benign breast disease could benefit from closer surveillance and personalized screening strategies.",
  "Breast cancer stem cells (CSCs) are distinct CD44<sup>+</sup>-subpopulations that are involved in metastasis and chemoresistance. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of CD44 in breast CSCs-mediated tumorigenesis remains elusive. We observed high CD44 expression in advanced-stage clinical breast tumor samples. CD44 activation in breast CSCs sorted from various triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines induced proliferation, migration, invasion, mammosphere formation that were reversed in presence of inhibitor, 4-methyl umbelliferone or CD44 silencing. CD44 activation in breast CSCs induced Src, Akt, and nuclear translocation of pSTAT3. PCR arrays revealed differential expression of a metabolic gene, Lipoprotein lipase (LPL), and transcription factor, SNAI3. Differential transcriptional regulation of LPL by pSTAT3 and SNAI3 was confirmed by promoter-reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. Orthotopic xenograft murine breast tumor model revealed high tumorigenicity of CD24<sup>-</sup>/CD44<sup>+</sup>-breast CSCs as compared with CD24<sup>+</sup>-breast cancer cells. Furthermore, stable breast CSCs-CD44 shRNA and/or intratumoral administration of Tetrahydrolipstatin (LPL inhibitor) abrogated tumor progression and neoangiogenesis. Thus, LPL serves as a potential target for an efficacious therapeutics against aggressive breast cancer.",
  "Associations between fiber intake and breast cancer risk have been evaluated in prospective studies, but overall, the evidence is inconsistent.\u00a0The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies to investigate the relation between intake of total and types of fiber with breast cancer incidence.The MEDLINE and Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE) databases were searched through July 2019 for prospective studies that reported on the association between fiber consumption and incident breast cancer. The pooled relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated comparing the highest versus the lowest category of total and types of fiber consumption, using a random-effects meta-analysis.The authors identified 17 cohort studies, 2 nested case-control studies, and 1 clinical trial study. Total fiber consumption was associated with an 8% lower risk of breast cancer (comparing the highest versus the lowest category,\u00a0pooled RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88-0.95 [I<sup>2</sup> \u00a0=\u00a012.6%]). Soluble fiber was found to be significantly inversely associated with risk of breast cancer (pooled RR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.84-0.96; I<sup>2</sup> = 12.6%]) and insoluble fiber was found to be suggestively inversely associated with risk of breast cancer (pooled RR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.86-1.00; I<sup>2</sup> = 33.4%]). Higher total fiber intake was associated with a lower risk of both premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancers (pooled RR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.67-0.99; I<sup>2</sup> \u00a0=\u00a035.2%] and pooled\u00a0RR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.88-0.95; I<sup>2</sup> \u00a0=\u00a00.0%], respectively). Furthermore, the authors observed a nonsignificant inverse association between intake of total fiber and risk of both estrogen and progesterone receptor-positive and estrogen and progesterone receptor-negative breast cancers.A random-effects meta-analysis of prospective observational studies demonstrated that high total fiber consumption was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. This finding was consistent for soluble fiber as well as for women with premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer.",
  "Breast cancer patients with lymphatic metastasis suffer from poor prognoses. There is an urgent need for controlling lymph node metastasis, but it has proven challenging so far. Here, we implemented LASSO analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas database to identify genes related to lymph node metastasis and prognosis, and 15 genes were selected. We constructed a functional protein association network and univariate Cox regression to identify significant genes. The results showed that BAHD1 could be predictive of lymph node metastasis as well as prognosis. In vitro studies demonstrated that BAHD1 exerted appreciable effects on the proliferation, migration, and invasion capacity of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, downregulation of BAHD1 induced cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. Additionally, the mRNA levels of CCND1, CDK1 and YWHAZ were decreased upon BAHD1 silencing. These findings indicate that the expression of BAHD1 is essential in the progression of breast cancer, which may provide novel therapeutic and diagnostic clues and insights into the prevention of lymph node metastasis in breast cancer.",
  "Female BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers may elect bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy. There is a paucity of data on yield of imaging surveillance after risk-reducing mastectomy. This retrospective study focused on female BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers who underwent bilateral mastectomy either as primary preventative, or as secondary preventative, after breast cancer diagnosis. All participants underwent breast imaging at 6- to 12-month intervals after mastectomy. Data on subsequent breast cancer diagnosis and timing were collected and compared between the groups. Overall, 184 female mutation carriers (134 BRCA1, 45 BRCA2, 5 both BRCA genes) underwent bilateral mastectomy after initial breast cancer diagnosis, between April 1, 2009 and August 31, 2018. During a mean follow-up of 6.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.2\u00a0years, 13 (7.06%) were diagnosed with breast cancer; 12 ipsilateral (range: 0.4-28.8\u00a0years) and 1 contralateral breast cancer, 15.9\u00a0years after surgery. On the contrary, among asymptomatic BRCA1 (n\u00a0=\u00a040) and BRCA2 (n\u00a0=\u00a013) mutation carriers who underwent primary risk-reducing mastectomy (mean age at surgery 39.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.4\u00a0years); none has developed breast cancer after a mean follow-up of 5.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.4\u00a0years. BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers with prior disease who underwent risk-reducing mastectomy after breast cancer diagnosis are still prone for developing ipsi or contralateral breast cancer, and therefore may benefit from continues clinical and imaging surveillance, unlike BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers who undergo primary preventative bilateral mastectomy.",
  "Evidence linking breast size to breast cancer risk has been inconsistent, and its interpretation is often hampered by confounding factors such as body mass index (BMI). Here, we used linkage disequilibrium score regression and two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to examine the genetic associations between BMI, breast size and breast cancer risk.Summary-level genotype data from 23andMe, Inc (breast size, n\u2009=\u200933\u00a0790), the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (breast cancer risk, n\u2009=\u2009228\u00a0951) and the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (BMI, n\u2009=\u2009183\u00a0507) were used for our analyses. In assessing causal relationships, four complementary MR techniques [inverse variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, weighted mode and MR-Egger regression] were used to test the robustness of the results.The genetic correlation (rg) estimated between BMI and breast size was high (rg\u2009=\u20090.50, P\u2009=\u20093.89x10-43). All MR methods provided consistent evidence that higher genetically predicted BMI was associated with larger breast size [odds ratio (ORIVW): 2.06 (1.80-2.35), P\u2009=\u20091.38x10-26] and lower overall breast cancer risk [ORIVW: 0.81 (0.74-0.89), P\u2009=\u20099.44x10-6]. No evidence of a relationship between genetically predicted breast size and breast cancer risk was found except when using the weighted median and weighted mode methods, and only with oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative risk. There was no evidence of reverse causality in any of the analyses conducted (P\u2009>\u20090.050).Our findings indicate a potential positive causal association between BMI and breast size and a potential negative causal association between BMI and breast cancer risk. We found no clear evidence for a direct relationship between breast size and breast cancer risk.",
  "Neoplasm is an abnormal mass of tissue that grows excessively and not coordinated with normal tissue growth and continues to do so even though the stimulation that triggered the change has stopped. Breast cancer can be known by using tumor marker, which has been used is mucin-like glycoprotein Carcinoma Antigen (CA 15-3) which is a tumor marker that is specific to breast cancer.This study is a cross-sectional study to determine the association between molecular subtypes of locally advanced breast cancer with CA 15-3 level at Abdul Wahab Sjahranie Samarinda Hospital. The population in this study were all breast cancer patients that were confirmed by histopathological examination.A total of 75 patients were included for this study, 29 patients (38.7%) known as Overexpression HER2, 18 patients (24.0%) were Luminal B with HER2 (+), 11 patients (14.7%) were Luminal B with HER2 (-), 11 patients (14.7%) were Basal-like/TNBC, and 6 patients (8,0%) were Luminal A. From the ANOVA test, the value of p =\u00a00.045 (p <\u00a00.05) means there was an association between Ca 15-3 level and molecular subtypes in patients with locally advanced breast cancer at the Abdul Wahab Sjahranie Hospital in Samarinda 2017. In this study Ca 15-3 levels were obtained on average for Luminal A 16.98\u00a0U/mL, Luminal B with HER2 (-) 42.41\u00a0U/mL, Luminal B with HER2 (+) 73.75\u00a0U/mL, Overexpression HER2 47.73\u00a0U/mL, and Basal Like /TNBC 63.50\u00a0U/mL.Statistically, it was found that there was an association between Ca 15-3 levels and molecular subtypes in patients with locally advanced breast cancer at the Abdul Wahab Sjahranie Hospital in Samarinda 2017.",
  "Globally, among all women, the most frequently detected and diagnosed and the most lethal type of cancer is breast cancer (BC). In particular, bone is one of the most frequent distant metastases 24in breast cancer patients and bone metastasis arises in approximately 80% of advanced patients. Thus, we need to identify and validate early detection markers that can differentiate metastasis from non-metastasis breast cancers.GSE55715, GSE103357, and GSE146661 gene expression profiling data were downloaded from the GEO database. There was 14 breast cancer with bone metastasis samples and 8 breast cancer tissue samples. GEO2R was used to screen for differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The volcano plots, Venn diagrams, and annular heatmap were generated by using the ggplot2 package. By using the cluster Profiler R package, KEGG and GO enrichment analyses of DEGs were conducted. Through PPI network construction using the STRING database, key hub genes were identified by cytoHubba. Finally, K-M survival and ROC curves were generated to validate hub gene expression.By GO enrichment analysis, 143 DEGs were enriched in the following GO terms: extracellular structure organization, extracellular matrix organization, leukocyte migration class II protein complex, collagen tridermic protein complex, extracellular matrix structural constituent, growth factor binding, and platelet-derived growth factor binding. In the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, DEGs were enriched in Staphylococcus aureus infection, Complement and coagulation cascades, and Asthma. By PPI network analysis, we selected the top 10 genes, including SLCO2B1, STAB1, SERPING1, HLA-DOA, AIF1, GIMAP4, C1orf162, HLA-DMB, ADAP2, and HAVCR2. By using TCGA and THPA databases, we validated 2 genes, SERPING1 and GIMAP4, that were related to the early detection of bone metastasis in BC.2 abnormally expressed hub genes could play a pivotal role in the breast cancer with bone metastasis by affecting bone homeostasis imbalance in the bone microenvironment.",
  "The aggressive nature of breast cancers detected between planned mammographic screens, so-called interval cancers, remains elusive. Here, we aim to characterise underlying molecular features of interval cancer.From 672 patients with invasive breast cancer, we analysed gene expression differences between 90 'true' interval cancer cases (i.e. women with low-dense breasts defined as per cent mammographic density <25%) and 310 screen-detected tumours while accounting for PAM50 subtypes and thus overall tumour aggressiveness. We computed an interval cancer gene expression profile (IC-Gx) in a total of 2270 breast tumours (regardless of interval cancer status) and tested for association with expression-based immune subtypes in breast cancer. In addition, we investigated the contribution of inherited and somatic genetic variants in distinct features of interval cancer.We identified 8331 genes nominally associated with interval cancer (P-value\u00a0<\u00a00.05, fold-change\u00a0>\u00a01.5). Gene set enrichment analysis showed immune-related pathways as key processes altered in interval cancer. Our IC-Gx, based on 47 genes with the strongest associations (false discovery rate\u00a0<\u00a00.05), was found to be associated mainly with immune subtypes involving interferon response. We isolated an interaction network of interval cancer and interferon genes for which a significant load of somatic and germline variants in class I interferon genes was observed.We identified novel molecular features of interval breast cancer highlighting interferon pathways as a potential target for prevention or treatment.",
  "We aimed to validate the clinical significance of locoregional surgery in improving the prognosis of primary metastatic breast cancer (pMBC).We conducted a population-based retrospective study by analyzing clinical data obtained from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Stratification analysis was employed to assess the effect of breast surgery on breast cancer-specific survival and overall survival. Then propensity score matching and COX regression models were employed to evaluate the survival advantages of breast surgery, if any in patients with pMBC.The median BCSS and OS in the surgery group were almost twice of that in the group without surgery. Breast surgery provided a survival advantage for patients with a single metastasis in the bone, liver or lung, but not in the brain. We found that axillary lymph node dissection performed in combination with specific breast surgical procedures did not result in a significant improvement in survival. Additionally, when combined with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, surgery significantly improved the survival and was not influenced by the molecular subtype and tumor size. Finally, using COX regression models before and after propensity score matching, breast surgery was found to reduce the risk of mortality in patients with MBC by more than 40%.The effect of locoregional surgery has been underestimated in pMBC patients. Surgical procedures should be seriously considered when planning combination treatments for pMBC patients with a single metastasis except for brain metastasis.",
  "Breast cancer is the commonest malignant tumor among Chinese females, ranking first in terms of incidence of female cancers. Commissioned by the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, the National Cancer Center formulated the Guideline for Screening and Early Diagnosis and Treatment of Female Breast Cancer in China according to WHO Handbook for Guideline Development. The methods on Cochrane China were referred to for the formulation of the system evaluation procedures. The GRADE methods for assessment, formulation and evaluation were adopted for the classification of evidence quality and recommendation strength, and the items were reported according to Reporting Items for Practice Guidelines in Healthcare. Based on the results of evaluation, the guideline gives evidence-based recommendations for the appropriate population and technical procedures for breast cancer screening and early diagnosis and treatment after comprehensive consideration of China's national conditions, the advantages and disadvantages of the evidence, the quality of the evidence, the economic cost of screening, the feedback of multidisciplinary clinical research respondents, and in-person expert consensus. It is aimed at regulating the practices of female breast cancer screening and early diagnosis and treatment and enhancing the effectiveness of the prevention and control of female breast cancer in China.",
  "To describe the use of hormonal contraceptives in Danish breast cancer patients.Nationwide drug utilization study in Danish women diagnosed with breast cancer at ages 13-50\u2009years during 2000-2015. User proportions were estimated in 6-months intervals from 2\u2009years before to 2\u2009years after diagnosis.Use of hormonal contraceptives declined sharply after breast cancer diagnosis. Still, 7% of patients aged 13-39\u2009years filled hormonal contraceptive prescriptions within 6\u00a0months after the diagnosis.The majority of premenopausal breast cancer patients discontinues hormonal contraception at diagnosis. All prescribers of hormonal contraceptives should acknowledge that hormonal contraception is contraindicated for breast cancer patients.Use of hormonal contraception is contraindicated among women with breast cancer. In this nationwide study, we assessed the use of hormonal contraceptives among all Danish premenopausal women diagnosed with breast cancer during 2000-2015. Hormonal contraceptive use was assessed within 2 years before and 2 years after breast cancer diagnosis. The majority of patients discontinued hormonal contraception at breast cancer diagnosis. However, 7% of patients aged 13-39 years filled hormonal contraceptive prescriptions within 6 months after the diagnosis.",
  "Breast cancer metastasis accounts for most of the deaths from breast cancer. Identification of germline variants associated with survival in aggressive types of breast cancer may inform understanding of breast cancer progression and assist treatment. In this analysis, we studied the associations between germline variants and breast cancer survival for patients with distant metastases at primary breast cancer diagnosis. We used data from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) including 1062 women of European ancestry with metastatic breast cancer, 606 of whom died of breast cancer. We identified two germline variants on chromosome 1, rs138569520 and rs146023652, significantly associated with breast cancer-specific survival (P\u2009=\u20093.19\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-8</sup> and 4.42\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-8</sup>). In silico analysis suggested a potential regulatory effect of the variants on the nearby target genes SDE2 and H3F3A. However, the variants showed no evidence of association in a smaller replication dataset. The validation dataset was obtained from the SNPs to Risk of Metastasis (StoRM) study and included 293 patients with metastatic primary breast cancer at diagnosis. Ultimately, larger replication studies are needed to confirm the identified associations.",
  "Breast cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer among women worldwide. The heterogeneous nature of breast cancer poses a serious challenge for prognostic prediction and individualized therapies. Recently, ferroptosis, an iron\u2011dependent form of programmed cell death, has been reported to serve a significant role in the regulation of the biological behavior of tumors. Several studies have revealed the prognostic significance of the ferroptosis\u2011related gene (FRG) model; however, additional efforts are required to elucidate the details. Moreover, genes that modulate ferroptosis may be promising candidate bioindicators in cancer therapy. The present study systematically assessed the expression profiles of FRGs to reveal the relationship between FRGs and the prognostic features of patients with breast cancer based on data obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium. Using a non\u2011negative matrix factorization clustering method, patients with breast cancer were classified into two sub\u2011groups (cluster\u00a01 and cluster\u00a02) based on the expression of FRGs. Furthermore, Cox regression, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator methods were used to construct a risk score formula comprised of nine genes, which stratified patients with breast cancer into two risk groups. Patients belonging to the high\u2011risk group exhibited significantly shorter overall survival (OS) time compared with patients in the low\u2011risk group. The prognostic value of this signature was further verified in the training and validation cohorts. The results for univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses indicated that risk score acted as an independent predictor for OS. Subsequently, a nomogram was constructed. Receiver operating characteristic analysis further confirmed that the resulting nomogram exhibited powerful discriminatory ability. Functional analysis revealed that the immune environment differed notably between the two groups and indicated an association between ferroptosis and breast cancer proliferation, migration and drug resistance. Taken together, the present study demonstrated that FRGs were significantly associated with breast cancer progression, and thus could be used as novel biomarkers for prognostic prediction and individualized treatment of patients with breast cancer.",
  "Several evidence has demonstrated the involvement of the ribosomal proteins (RPs) in many malignancies, however, the function and clinical relevance of the RPs in breast cancer remains unclear. The present study aims to contribute to the understanding of the role of the RPs in breast tumorigenesis and its clinical implications in the field of biomarker discovery and outcome prediction. We investigated the proteomic and transcriptomic expression of the RPs in non-tumor and tumor tissues of different breast cancer subtypes, and integrated bioinformatics approaches and online databases to comprehensively evaluate the potential functions, regulatory networks, mutational landscape, and prognostic values of the ribosomal proteins in breast cancer. Our results show that 33 RPs have deregulated expression in breast cancer and its subtypes and that 26 RPs have potential as prognostic markers in a subtype-dependent way, with mutations in RP genes being frequent in breast tumors and related to overall survival and relapse-free status. Our RP gene regulatory network indicates the transcription factors MYC, ETS1, and SPI1, and the miRNAs has-let-7c-5p, has-mir-20b-5p, and has-mir-4668-3p as regulators of the RPs expression in breast cancer. The RPs were associated with several clinicopathological parameters of breast cancer and predicted to be involved in ribosomal-independent mechanisms such as regulation of the SLITS-ROBO pathway. This study comprehensively investigated the ribosomal proteins in breast cancer, suggesting that the RPs have clinical potential as biomarkers of diagnostic and prognostic, also providing an in-depth view of the RPs significance in breast cancer.",
  "Breast cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease. Unfortunately, it is the most common malignancy diagnosed in women in the USA, with 281,550 new cases of invasive breast cancer and 49,290 new cases of noninvasive breast cancer are diagnosed per year. In England, it is currently estimated that approximately 1 in 7 (14%) women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime. In the UK in 2017, 54,700 women and 390 men were diagnosed with breast cancer. The risk of breast cancer is influenced by many factors, including but not limited to age, family history, reproductive history, hormonal exposure, proliferative breast lesions, physical activity, alcohol use, tobacco use, breast density, and environmental exposures. Breast cancer risk assessment is a critical part of public health. By identifying women at high risk for breast cancer, personalized recommendations can be deployed with regards to modes of screening, the age to initiate breast screening, and the frequency for completing such screens. In addition, breast cancer risk assessment can assist in determining a woman's eligibility for interventions to reduce risk, either through the use of chemoprevention medications or through surgical means with risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy. This chapter summarizes breast cancer risk assessment models and discusses interventions to reduce breast cancer risk to aid in reducing morbidity and mortality from breast cancer.",
  "Factors such as socioeconomic status, age at menarche and childbearing patterns are components that have been shown to influence mammary gland development and establish breast cancer disparity. Pubertal mammary gland development is selected as the focus of this review, as it is identified as a \"window of susceptibility\" for breast cancer risk and disparity. Here we recognize non-Hispanic White, African American, and Asian American women as the focus of breast cancer disparity, in conjunction with diets associated with changes in breast cancer risk. Diets consisting of high fat, N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, N-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, as well as obesity and the Western diet have shown to lead to changes in pubertal mammary gland development in mammalian models, therefore increasing the risk of breast cancer and breast cancer disparity. While limited intervention strategies are offered to adolescents to mitigate development changes and breast cancer risk, the prominent solution to closing the disparity among the selected population is to foster lifestyle changes that avoid the deleterious effects of unhealthy diets.",
  "This study aimed to evaluate tumor characteristics in young age (20-39\u00a0years old) breast cancer (YABC) patients in Korea.We identified 10,897 breast cancer patients from 2010 to 2015. The data were collected through 10% systematic sampling of the Korea National Cancer Incidence Database (KNCI DB). Tumor size, lymph node status, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status were collected according to the Collaborative Stage version 2 (CSv2) Data Collection System.Of the 10,897 patients, 1245 (11.4%) were YABC patients. They were found to have larger tumors (T2: 41.6% in 20-39 age group vs 36.4% in 40-49 age group vs 36.5% in 50-59 age group vs 38.4% in\u2009\u2265\u200960 age group; T3: 10.1% vs 7.3% vs 6.5% vs 6.2%, P\u2009<\u2009.0001), greater rates of lymph node involvement (41.2% vs 32.7% vs 35.7% vs 32.5%, P\u2009<\u2009.0001), higher tumor grade (High grade: 26.8% vs 19.4% vs 23.5% vs 22.1%, P\u2009<\u2009.0001), and a larger proportion of triple-negative subtype (18.2% vs 11.0% vs 12.2% vs 13.5%, P\u2009<\u2009.0001). Compared to the 40-49 age group, breast cancer-related survival (BCRS) rates were worse (91.74% vs 95.04%, P\u2009<\u2009.0001), and the characteristics of YABC patients were associated with higher risk of death from breast cancer.YABC patients have more aggressive tumor characteristics and worse survival rates. Therefore, we need to identify high-risk groups among YABC patients and support active surveillance in them. These findings from a national cohort provide important information for establishing a national cancer care strategy to manage YABC patients.",
  "Public interest in breast cancer is associated with breast cancer awareness month. However, no study has analyzed the temporal trends in breast cancer interest or assessed how funding for breast cancer research is influenced by public interest.We performed a cross-sectional analysis of Google Trends using the search query \"Breast Cancer\" between January 2004 - July 2020. We then computed bivariate correlations to assess the association between relative search interest (RSI) and the financial records of the Susan G. Komen Foundation.Average search interest has declined since 2004. We identified increasing breast cancer RSI beginning in October 2009, corresponding with breast cancer awareness month, with an overall peak in 2012 followed by a downtrend through 2017. These fluctuations in peak RSI corresponded with the U.S. National Football League's initiation of \"Pink October\" during which the players wore pink jerseys which started in 2009 and ceased in 2017. We also found a strong correlation between peak RSI and Susan G. Komen Foundation net assets as well as funding of public health screening services and public health education.Average interest in breast cancer has been declining since 2004 and peak interest, as well as breast cancer funding, has been declining since 2012. This suggests new marketing efforts are needed to improve breast cancer awareness and to increase fundraising.Considering the decline in breast cancer interest and funding, we recommend implementing local, regional, and national policies that improve marketing campaigns and improve breast cancer awareness.",
  "This short report aims to investigate changes in lifespan of Australian women with breast cancer using the novel average lifespan shortened (ALSS) measure METHODS: We obtained the mortality data of Australian women with breast cancer from the World Health Organization mortality database for the 1990-2015 period. We calculated the age-standardized rate (ASR) according to the World Standard Population. We estimated the ALSS as a ratio of years of life lost in relation to the expected lifespan to examine changes in lifespan of Australian women with breast cancer over the study period.Over a 25-year period, the ASR of breast cancer deaths decreased from 20.5 to 12.6 deaths per 100,000 women. We observed a decline in ALSS values from 24.0% of their lifespan in 1990 to 22.0% in 2015.The novel ALSS measure indicates an improvement of two percentage points in the lifespan of Australian women with breast cancer over the study.",
  "Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare variety of breast cancer accounting for two percent of breast cancer diagnoses in the United States. It is characterized by peau d'orange, breast edema and erythema on physical examination and dermal lymphatic invasion by tumor emboli on histological examination. Micrometastases to lymphatics and bone marrow at the time of diagnosis and angiogenic properties of IBC explain the high propensity of this cancer to relapse and metastasize, its aggressiveness and poor prognosis. Preoperative sequential anthracycline and taxane (plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab if HER2-positive) based chemotherapy is the current standard of care for IBC. We herein report a case of stage IIIC triple-negative IBC treated with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy based neoadjuvant therapy with a complete clinical and complete pathological response. This is the first case of triple-negative IBC treated with this regimen reported in the literature, thereby providing clinical data on the tolerability and efficacy of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy based neoadjuvant regimen for the treatment of IBC.",
  "Low expression of tumor suppressor microRNA (miRNA) and high expression of carcinogenic miRNA promote the occurrence and progression of human cancer. Most studies show that miR-145 is a tumor suppressor miRNA, and is closely related to the clinicopathology of breast cancer. However, the results are still inconsistent. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis on the basis of eligible studies to summarize the possible correlation between miR-145 and the clinicopathology and prognosis of breast cancer. Using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Wanfang and CNKI, we searched all published papers written in either English or Chinese on miR-145 expression in breast cancer from 1990 to November 2019 for meta-analysis. We used standardized mean difference (SMD) to evaluate the differential expression of miR-145 in breast cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues or normal breast tissues. We found that miR-145 expression was significantly lower in breast cancer tissues than that in adjacent normal tissues (SMD = -2.93, P<0.0001) and in healthy women (SMD = -0.52, P=0.009). miR-145 expression was lower in breast cancer patients with ER-positive (SMD = 0.65, P<0.001), HER-2-positive (SMD = -1.04, P<0.001), compared with their counterparts, respectively. In addition, breast cancer patients with low expression of miR-145 had larger tumor diameters (SMD = -1.97, P<0.001) and lymph node metastasis (SMD = -1.75, P<0.001) that are unfavorable prognostic factors. Conclusion: Low miR-145 is observed in breast cancer, which is closely related to molecular subtypes and unfavorable factors of breast cancer. These findings indicate that miR-145 is tumor suppressor miRNA, and may be a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker in breast cancer.",
  "Breast cancer is an umbrella term referring to a group of biologically and molecularly heterogeneous diseases originating from the breast. Globally, incidences of breast cancer has been increasing dramatically over the past decades. Analyses of multiple clinical \"big data\" can aid us in clarifying the means of preventing the disease. In addition, predisposing risk factors will be the most important issues if we can confirm their relevance. This study aims to provide an overview of the predisposing factors that contribute to a higher possibility of developing breast cancer and emphasize the signs that we ought to pay more attention to.This is a matched nested case-control study. The cohort focused on identifying the eligible risk factors in breast cancer development by data screening (2000-2013) from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) under approved protocol. A total of 486,069 females were enrolled from a nationwide sampled database, and 3281 females was elligible as breast cancer cohort, 478,574 females who had never diagnosed with breast cancer from 2000 to 2013 were eligible as non-breast cancer controls, and matched to breast cancer cases according to age using a 1:6 ratio.We analyzed 3281 breast cancer cases and 19,686 non-breast cancer controls after an age-matched procedure. The significant predisposing factors associated with breast cancer development including obesity, hyperlipidemia, thyroid cancer and liver cancer. As for patients under the age of 55, gastric cancer does seem to have an impact on the development of breast cancer; compared with their counterparts over the age of 55, endometrial cancer appears to exhibit an evocative effect.In this nationwide matched nested case-control study, we identified obesity, hyperlipidemia, previous cancers of the thyroid, stomach and liver as risk factors associated with breast cancer. However, the retrospective nature and limited case numbers of certain cancers still difficult to provide robust evidence. Further prospective studies are necessitated to corroborate this finding in order to nip the disease in the bud.The studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the China Medical University Hospital [CMUH104-REC2-115(AR-4)].",
  "Although surgical resection is the main modality of treatment for breast cancer, some patients elect to refuse the recommended surgery. We assessed racial and ethnic differences in women 40\u00a0years and older who received or refused to receive surgical treatment for breast cancer in the USA and whether racial disparities in mortality were affected by their differences in the prevalence of refusal for surgical treatment.We studied 277,127 women with breast cancer using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data and performed multivariable logistic regressions to investigate the association between surgery status of breast cancer and race/ethnicity. Additionally, we performed Cox regression analyses to determine the predictors of mortality outcomes.Of 277,127 patients with breast cancer, 1468 (0.53%) refused to receive the recommended surgical treatment in our cohort. Non-Hispanic Black women were 112% more likely to refuse the recommended surgical treatment for breast cancer compared to their non-Hispanic White counterparts [adjusted odds ratio: 2.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.82-2.47]. Women who underwent breast-conserving surgery [hazards ratio (HR) 0.15, 95% CI 0.13-0.16] and mastectomy (HR 0.21, 95% CI 0.18-0.23) had lower hazard ratios of mortality as compared to women who refused the recommended treatment after adjusting for covariates.Race/ethnicity was associated with refusal for the recommended surgery, especially among non-Hispanic Black women. Also, surgery refusal was associated with a higher risk of all-cause and breast cancer-related mortality. These disparities stress the need to tailor interventions aimed at raising awareness of the importance of following physician recommendations among minorities.",
  "RUNX1 has long known for its role in hematopoiesis until recently it is implicated in human breast cancer pathogenesis. This has drawn attention in research as elevated expression of RUNX1 has been observed in invasive breast cancer, and mutations of the RUNX1 gene and its binding partner CBF\u03b2 have been identified in luminal breast cancer patients, many of which have attributed to the development and progression of the disease. Increasing number of evidence also shows the involvement of RUNX1 in breast cancer migration and invasion that may lead to breast cancer metastasis. However, more studies need to be conducted to better understand its roles in these particular subtypes in breast cancer. This is important as evidence so far indicates that there are\u00a0discrepancies with regards to the roles of RUNX1 in ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer, both of which have posted a great challenge to recognize whether its deregulation is protecting or promoting breast cancer. This warrants further analysis to glean more information especially considering the perturbation of RUNX1 is mainly reported in ER-positive breast cancer. In this review, the roles of RUNX1 in breast cancer are discussed in a context dependent manner based on its involvement in the development and progression of the disease. The association of RUNX1 with other types of cancer is also included to emphasize a wider and possibly a different angle of involvement of RUNX1 in cancer.",
  "The incidence of cancer is increasing today, particularly lung and chest cancer. Employing novel methods to detect cancer in its earliest stages and discover painless, noninvasive treatments are urgently needed. The goal of the proposed study is to investigate the value of automated breast volume scanning (ABUS) in conjunction with contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) in properly diagnosing breast cancer in its early stages and the effectiveness of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in treating the disease. For the research study, information on 98 patients who had NAC and surgery in the breast surgery department of the Shaanxi Provincial Cancer Hospital has been gathered. All patients have received four cycles of NAC and underwent conventional ultrasound (HUSS), CEUS, ABUS, and pathological examination. At the same time, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, single factor, multiple linear regression, and other methods have also been used to analyze the diagnostic efficacy of breast cancer and NAC efficacy evaluation results. The study of this paper is totally based on the data collected from Shaanxi Provincial Cancer Hospital. The statistical and computational analyses are performed on the data collected for drawing inferences. When the findings are compared to the results of the pathological examination, HUSS has demonstrated a significant distinction between benign and malignant diagnoses with a statistical value of <i>P</i> < 0.05.ABUS combined with CEUS has shown no considerable differences in correlation study. Except for negative likelihood ratio, the diagnostic performance indexes of CEUS+ ABUS are substantially higher than HHUS with <i>P</i> < 0.05. ROC curve analysis is also performed which shows that CEUS and ABUS combination has higher precision in the analysis of breast cancer. ABUS pooled with CEUS shows great application value in the judgment of breast cancer as per the results obtained from the statistical analysis on data of 98 patients.",
  "Background We analyzed the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after primary systemic therapy (PST) according to tumor subtype. Patients and methods Two-hundred and four breast cancer patients treated with PST were studied. MRI findings after PST were compared with pathologic findings, and results were stratified based on tumor subtype. Results Of the two-hundred and four breast cancer patients, eighty-four (41.2%) achieved a pathologic complete response (pCR) in the breast. The MRI accuracy for predicting pCR was highest in triple-negative (TN) and HER2-positive (non-luminal) breast cancer (83.9 and 80.9%, respectively). The mean size discrepancy between MRI-measured and pathologic residual tumor size was lowest in TN breast cancer and highest in luminal B-like (HER2-negative) breast cancer (0.45cm vs. 0.98 cm, respectively; p = 0.003). After breast conserving surgery (BCS), we found a lower rate of positive margins in TN breast cancer and a higher rate of positive margins in luminal B-like (HER2-negative) breast cancer (2.4% vs. 23.6%, respectively). Conclusions If tumor response after PST is assessed by MRI, tumor subtype should be considered when BCS is planned. The accuracy of MRI is highest in TN breast cancer.",
  "<b>Background:</b> This study aimed to explore the hypothesis that the stage of breast cancer at initial diagnosis in 2020 is more advanced compared with 2019. <b>Methods:</b> Tumor, node, metastasis and Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) stages of new breast cancer diagnoses at the Bucks Breast Unit from May 2019 to October 2020 were reviewed. A p <\u00a00.05 was considered significant. <b>Results:</b> Average UICC stage increased from 1a in 2019 to 2a in 2020 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Excluding cancers detected through screening, UICC stage still increased from 1b in 2019 to 2a in 2020 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0184). There was a significant increase in the percentage of node-positive patients (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0063) and patients with metastatic disease (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0295) on initial presentation. <b>Conclusion:</b> Overall, patients presented with higher UICC stages and more node-positive and metastatic disease on initial diagnosis in 2020 compared with 2019.",
  "We evaluated self-report of decision quality and regret with breast cancer surgical treatment by pre-operative breast MRI use in women recently diagnosed with breast cancer.We conducted a survey with 957 women aged 18\u2009+\u2009with stage 0-III breast cancer identified in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. Participants self-reported receipt of pre-operative breast MRI. Primary outcomes were process measures in the Breast Cancer Surgery Decision Quality Instrument (BCS-DQI) (continuous outcome) and Decision Regret Scale (dichotomized outcome as any/none). Generalized estimating equations with linear and logit link were used to estimate adjusted associations between breast MRI and primary outcomes. All analyses were also stratified by breast density.Survey participation rate was 27.9% (957/3430). Study population was primarily\u2009>\u200960\u00a0years, White, college educated, and diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. Pre-operative breast MRI was reported in 46% of women. A higher proportion of women who were younger age (<\u200950\u00a0years), commercially insured, and self-detected their breast cancer reported pre-operative breast MRI use. In adjusted analysis, pre-operative breast MRI use compared with no use was associated with a small but statistically significantly higher decision quality scores (69.5 vs 64.7, p-value\u2009=\u20090.043). Decision regret did not significantly differ in women who reported\u00a0pre-operative breast MRI use compared with no use (54.2% v. 48.7%, respectively, p-value\u2009=\u20090.11). Study results did not vary when stratified by breast density for either primary outcome.Breast MRI use in the diagnostic work-up of breast cancer does not negatively alter women's perceptions of surgical treatment decisions in early survivorship.NCT03029286.",
  "While breast reconstruction often improves the quality of life of patients with locally advanced breast cancer, there is still no consensus on its safety. This retrospective report aimed to verify the safety of immediate breast reconstruction for locally advanced breast cancer.We retrospectively analyzed 500 breast cancer surgeries performed between January 2005 and December 2019 at our hospital, including 120 immediate breast reconstructions. The following five items were analyzed: the patients' choice of reconstruction method, rate of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, surgical margin positivity rate, complications associated with surgery, overall survival rate, and breast cancer-free survival rate.Sixty-three of the 120 patients underwent autologous breast reconstruction. Of those who underwent reconstruction surgery, 95.8% received chemotherapy and 78.3% underwent post-mastectomy radiation therapy. Reconstruction failed in 8 cases with tissue expander and in 1 case with free TRAM flap. Breast reconstruction surgery was not a factor in delaying adjuvant therapy, but complications requiring intervention tended to increase the duration of adjuvant therapy. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of surgical margin positivity, overall survival rate, or breast cancer-free survival rate.Although complications associated with reconstructive surgery occurred, appropriate intervention prevented delays in breast cancer treatment, and the complications did not negatively affect the overall or breast cancer-free survival rates. Our study found no evidence to avoid primary breast reconstruction in patients with locally advanced breast cancer.",
  "Testing for BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants is recommended for women aged \u226445\u00a0years with breast cancer. Some studies have found racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in testing. We linked Massachusetts' All-Payer Claims Database with Massachusetts Cancer Registry data to assess factors associated with BRCA1/2 testing among young women with breast cancer in Massachusetts, a state with high levels of access to care and equitable insurance coverage of breast cancer gene (BRCA) testing.We identified breast cancer diagnoses in the Massachusetts Cancer Registry from 2010 to 2013 and linked registry data with Massachusetts All-Payer Claims Data from 2010 to 2014 among women aged \u226445\u00a0years with private insurance or Medicaid. We used multivariable logistic regression to examine factors associated with BRCA1/2 testing within 6\u00a0months of diagnosis.The study population included 2424 women; 80.3% were identified as non-Hispanic White, 6.4% non-Hispanic Black, and 6.3% Hispanic. Overall, 54.9% received BRCA1/2 testing within 6\u00a0months of breast cancer diagnosis. In adjusted analyses, non-Hispanic Black women had less than half the odds of testing compared with non-Hispanic White women (adjusted odds ratio [OR]\u00a0=\u00a00.45, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.31, 0.64). Medicaid-insured women had half the odds of testing compared with privately-insured women (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.51, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.41, 0.63). Living in lower-income areas was also associated with lower odds of testing. Having an academically-affiliated oncology clinician was not associated with testing.Socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities exist in BRCA1/2 testing among women with breast cancer in Massachusetts, despite equitable insurance coverage of testing. Further research should examine whether disparities have persisted with growing testing awareness and availability over time.",
  "miR-223 is an anti-inflammatory miRNA that in cancer acts either as an oncosuppressor or oncopromoter, in a context-dependent manner. In breast cancer, we demonstrated that it dampens the activation of the EGF pathway. However, little is known on the role of miR-223 during breast cancer onset and progression. miR-223 expression was decreased in breast cancer of luminal and HER2 subtypes and inversely correlated with patients' prognosis. In normal luminal mammary epithelial cells, miR-223 acted cell autonomously in the control of their growth and morphology in three-dimensional context. In the MMTV-\u039416HER2 transgenic mouse model, oncogene transformation resulted in a timely abrogation of miR-223 expression, likely due to activation of E2F1, a known repressor of miR-223 transcription. Accordingly, treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors, which eventually results in restraining E2F1 activity, restored miR-223 expression and miR-223 ablation induced luminal breast cancer resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition, both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Notably, miR-223 expression was lost in microdissected ductal carcinoma <i>in situ</i> (DCIS) from patients with luminal and HER2-positive breast cancer. Altogether, these results identify downmodulation of miR-223 as an early step in luminal breast cancer onset and suggest that it could be used to identify aggressive DCIS and predict the response to targeted therapy. SIGNIFICANCE: miR-223 may represent a predictive biomarker of response to CDK4/6 inhibitors and its loss could identify DCIS lesions that are likely to progress into invasive breast cancer.",
  "Large-scale epidemiological surveys have shown that patients with Down syndrome, which is caused by a chromosomal abnormality (an extra chromosome 21), are significantly less likely to develop solid tumors, including breast cancer, than those without. This feature has prompted the search for oncogenes located on chromosome 21. Junctional adhesion molecule 2 (JAM2), which is located on chromosome 21, is expressed at low levels in breast cancer and is associated with a good prognosis. These findings strongly suggest that JAM2 may be a potential oncogene suppressor in breast cancer. However, the role and function of JAM2 in breast cancer are not yet clear. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the biological functions and mechanisms of JAM2 in breast cancer.Several databases were used to explore JAM2 expression in breast cancer and to analyze its diagnostic and prognostic value in breast cancer. Changes in relevant markers were examined at the gene and protein levels using RT-qPCR and Western blot techniques, in addition, cell migration and invasion abilities were identified by scratch assays and transwell assays. Untargeted metabolomics, transcriptome sequencing and Luminex liquid suspension chip detection were performed in combination to study the mechanisms.JAM2 is expressed at low levels in breast cancer, and patients with high JAM2 expression have a good prognosis, indicating that JAM2 has good clinical diagnostic and prognostic value. Overexpression of JAM2 can block the invasion and migration of breast cancer cells, and the mechanism may be that JAM2 inhibits the EMT pathway. Finally, combined multiomics analysis revealed that JAM2 may affect the immune microenvironment of breast cancer by influencing the secretion of CXCL9/10 from tumor cells.",
  "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple common breast cancer susceptibility variants. Many of these variants have differential associations by estrogen receptor (ER) status, but how these variants relate with other tumor features and intrinsic molecular subtypes is unclear.Among 106,571 invasive breast cancer cases and 95,762 controls of European ancestry with data on 173 breast cancer variants identified in previous GWAS, we used novel two-stage polytomous logistic regression models to evaluate variants in relation to multiple tumor features (ER, progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and grade) adjusting for each other, and to intrinsic-like subtypes.Eighty-five of 173 variants were associated with at least one tumor feature (false discovery rate\u2009<\u20095%), most commonly ER and grade, followed by PR and HER2. Models for intrinsic-like subtypes found nearly all of these variants (83 of 85) associated at p\u2009<\u20090.05 with risk for at least one luminal-like subtype, and approximately half (41 of 85) of the variants were associated with risk of at least one non-luminal subtype, including 32 variants associated with triple-negative (TN) disease. Ten variants were associated with risk of all subtypes in different magnitude. Five variants were associated with risk of luminal A-like and TN subtypes in opposite directions.This report demonstrates a high level of complexity in the etiology heterogeneity of breast cancer susceptibility variants and can inform investigations of subtype-specific risk prediction.",
  "Reducing variations in cancer treatment and survival is a key aim of the NSW Cancer Plan. Variations in breast cancer treatment and survival in NSW by remoteness and socioeconomic status of residence were investigated to determine benchmarks. Reducing variations in cancer treatment and survival is a key aim of the NSW Cancer Plan. Variations in breast cancer treatment and survival in NSW by remoteness and socioeconomic status of residence were investigated to determine benchmarks.A retrospective cohort study used linked data for invasive breast cancers, diagnosed in May 2002 to December 2015 from the NSW Cancer Registry, with corresponding inpatient, and medical and pharmaceutical insurance data. Associations between treatment modalities, area socioeconomic status and residential remoteness were explored using logistic regression. Predictors of breast cancer survival were investigated using Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimates and multivariate competing risk regression.Results indicated a high 5-year disease-specific survival in NSW of 90%. Crude survival was equivalent by residential remoteness and marginally lower in lower socioeconomic areas. Competing risk regression showed equivalent outcomes by area socioeconomic status, except for the least disadvantaged quintile, which showed a higher survival. Higher sub-hazard ratios for death occurred for women with breast cancer aged 70 + years, and more advanced stage. Adjusted analyses indicated more advanced stage in lower socioeconomic areas, with less breast reconstruction and radiotherapy, and marginally less hormone therapy for women from these areas. Conversely, among these women who had breast conserving surgery, there was higher use of chemotherapy. Remoteness of residence was associated in adjusted analyses with less radiotherapy and less immediate breast reconstruction. In these short term data, remoteness of residence was not associated with lower survival.This study provides benchmarks for monitoring future variations in treatment and survival.",
  "Breast density is an independent risk factor for the development of breast cancer and also decreases the sensitivity of mammography for screening. Consequently, women with extremely dense breasts face an increased risk of late diagnosis of breast cancer. These women are, therefore, underserved with current mammographic screening programs. The results of recent studies reporting on contrast-enhanced breast MRI as a screening method in women with extremely dense breasts provide compelling evidence that this approach can enable an important reduction in breast cancer mortality for these women and is cost-effective. Because there is now a valid option to improve breast cancer screening, the European Society of Breast Imaging (EUSOBI) recommends that women should be informed about their breast density. EUSOBI thus calls on all providers of mammography screening to share density information with the women being screened. In light of the available evidence, in women aged 50 to 70 years with extremely dense breasts, the EUSOBI now recommends offering screening breast MRI every 2 to 4 years. The EUSOBI acknowledges that it may currently not be possible to offer breast MRI immediately and everywhere and underscores that quality assurance procedures need to be established, but urges radiological societies and policymakers to act on this now. Since the wishes and values of individual women differ, in screening the principles of shared decision-making should be embraced. In particular, women should be counselled on the benefits and risks of mammography and MRI-based screening, so that they are capable of making an informed choice about their preferred screening method.

  "Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer among females and the second most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant immune cell population in the tumor microenvironment, including breast cancer. Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) play an important role in regulating breast cancer growth and metastasis, which still remains an obstacle for successful treatment of breast cancer and requires further investigation, as well as the potential therapeutic strategies. Cytokine array validated that C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8) is a pivotal chemokine secreted by TAMs, and CXCL8 could enhance breast cancer migration, invasion ability, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in both animal and human breast cancer. In this study, the clinical data firstly indicated that high CXCL8 expression was significantly associated with metastasis and tumor growth in breast cancer patients. Then, we showed that TAMs-released CXCL8 could markedly elevate the migration, invasion and EMT events in breast cancer cells, as well as the self-renewal of BCSCs in vitro. These processes were markedly abrogated by the treatment of Danirixin, a reversible and selective antagonist of CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2). Consistently, the in vivo analysis confirmed that CXCL8 suppression using Danirixin effectively reduced the tumor growth, lung metastasis and repressed the self-renewal of BCSCs. Collectively, TAMs/CXCL8 could enhance BCSCs self-renewal and breast cancer metastasis, and these effects could be markedly abolished by Danirixin treatment, suppressing breast cancer progression consequently. Therefore, Danirixin could be considered as a novel and effective therapeutic strategy for breast cancer treatment without obvious toxicity to major organs.",
  "Mammographic density (MD) increases breast cancer (BC) risk, however, its association with patient outcomes is unclear. We examined the association of baseline MD (BMD), and MD reduction (MDR) following BC treatment with patient outcomes. Six databases (CINAHL, Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, and Embase) were used to identify relevant articles. The PRISMA strategy was used to extract relevant details. Study quality and risk of bias were assessed using the \"Quality In Prognosis Studies\" (QUIPS) tool. A Meta-analysis and pooled risk estimates were performed. Results showed that BMD is associated with contralateral breast cancer (CBC) risk (HR\u202f=\u202f1.9; 95%CI: 1.3-3.0, p\u202f=\u202f0.0007), recurrence (HR\u202f=\u202f2.0; 95%CI: 1.0-4.0, p\u202f=\u202f0.04), and mortality (HR\u202f=\u202f1.4; 95%CI: 1.1-1.9, p\u202f=\u202f0.003). No association was found between BMD and prognosis (HR\u202f=\u202f3.2; 95%CI: 0.9-11.2, p\u202f=\u202f0.06). Data on risk estimates (95%CI) from BMD for survival [RR: 1.75; 0.99-3.1 to 2.4; 1.4-4.1], ipsilateral BC [HR: 1; 0.6-1.6 to 3; 1.2-7.5], and treatment response (OR, 1.8; 0.98-3.3) are limited. MDR showed no association with mortality (HR\u202f=\u202f0.5; 95%CI: 0.2-1.2, p\u202f=\u202f0.13). MDR is associated with a reduced risk of recurrence [HR/RR: 0.35; 0.17-0.68 to 1.33; 0.67-2.65)], however data on MDR and outcomes such as mortality [HR/RR: 0.5; 0.27-0.93 to 0.59; 0.22-0.88], and CBC risk [RR/HR: 0.53; 0.24-0.84 to 1.3; 0.6-2.7] are limited. Evidence, although sparse, demonstrates that high BMD is associated with an increased risk of recurrence, CBC, and mortality. Conversely, MDR is associated with a reduced risk of BC recurrence, CBC, and BC-related mortality.",
  "Alcohol intake is thought to be a risk factor for breast cancer, but the causal relationship and carcinogenic mechanisms are not clear. We performed an up-to-date meta-analysis of prospective studies to assess observational association, and then conducted MR analysis to make causal inference based on the genetic predisposition to alcohol consumption (\"drinks per week\") and pathological drinking behaviours (\"alcohol use disorder\" and \"problematic alcohol use\"), as well as genetically predicted DNA methylation at by alcohol-related CpG sites in blood. We found an observational dose-response association between alcohol intake and breast cancer incidence with an additional risk of 4% for per 10\u00a0g/day increase in alcohol consumption. Genetic predisposition to alcohol consumption (\"drinks per week\") was not causally associated with breast cancer incidence at the OR of 1.01 (95% CI 0.84, 1.23), but problematic alcohol use (PAU) was linked to a higher breast cancer risk at the OR of 1.76 (95% CI 1.04, 2.99) when conditioning on alcohol consumption. Epigenetic MR analysis identified four CpG sites, cg03260624 near CDC7 gene, cg10816169 near ZNF318 gene, cg03345232 near RIN3 gene, and cg26312998 near RP11-867G23.13 gene, where genetically predicted epigenetic modifications were associated with an increased breast cancer incidence risk. Our findings re-affirmed that alcohol consumption is of high risk for breast cancer incidence even at a very low dose, and the pathogenic effect of alcohol on breast cancer could be due to pathological drinking behaviour and epigenetic modification at several CpG sites, which could be potential intervention targets for breast cancer prevention.",
  "Breast cancer incidence rates are rising in low and middle-income countries (LMIC), and these populations have reduced access to advanced multidisciplinary treatment. Screening and early detection are therefore critical in these regions but must be affordable and sustainable. Mammography screening programs are well established in more affluent countries, but alternative strategies to reduce the breast cancer burden of LMIC (such as clinical breast examination, general breast health awareness, and addressing modifiable lifestyle factors including obesity) are likely to be more realistic at the present time.",
  "Chromatin state provides a clear decipherable blueprint for maintenance of transcriptional patterns, exemplifying a mitotically stable form of cellular programming in dividing cells. In this regard, genomic studies of chromatin states within cancerous tissues have the potential to uncover novel aspects of tumor biology and unique mechanisms associated with disease phenotypes and outcomes. The degree to which chromatin state differences occur in accordance with breast cancer features has not been established.We applied a series of unsupervised computational methods to identify chromatin and molecular differences associated with discrete physiologies across human breast cancer tumors.Chromatin patterns alone are capable of stratifying tumors in association with cancer subtype and disease progression. Major differences occur at DNA motifs for the transcription factor FOXA1, in hormone receptor-positive tumors, and motifs for SOX9 in Basal-like tumors. We find that one potential driver of this effect, the histone chaperone ANP32E, is inversely correlated with tumor progression and relaxation of chromatin at FOXA1 binding sites. Tumors with high levels of ANP32E exhibit an immune response and proliferative gene expression signature, whereas tumors with low ANP32E levels appear programmed for differentiation.Our results indicate that ANP32E may function through chromatin state regulation to control breast cancer differentiation and tumor plasticity. This study sets a precedent for future computational studies of chromatin changes in carcinogenesis.",
  "DNA methylation in blood may reflect adverse exposures accumulated over the lifetime and could therefore provide potential improvements in the prediction of cancer risk. A substantial body of research has shown associations between epigenetic aging and risk of disease, including cancer. Here we aimed to study epigenetic measures of aging and lifestyle-related factors in association with risk of breast cancer.Using data from four prospective case-control studies nested in three cohorts of European ancestry participants, including a total of 1,655 breast cancer cases, we calculated three methylation-based measures of lifestyle factors (body mass index [BMI], tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption) and seven measures of epigenetic aging (Horvath-based, Hannum-based, PhenoAge and GrimAge). All measures were regression-adjusted for their respective risk factors and expressed per standard deviation\u00a0(SD). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using conditional or unconditional logistic regression and pooled using fixed-effects meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted by age at blood draw, time from blood sample to diagnosis, oestrogen receptor-positivity status and tumour stage.None of the measures of epigenetic aging were associated with risk of breast cancer in the pooled analysis: Horvath 'age acceleration' (AA): OR\u00a0per SD\u2009=\u20091.02, 95%CI: 0.95-1.10; AA-Hannum: OR\u2009=\u20091.03, 95%CI:0.95-1.12; PhenoAge: OR\u2009=\u20091.01, 95%CI: 0.94-1.09 and GrimAge: OR\u2009=\u20091.03, 95%CI: 0.94-1.12, in models adjusting for white blood cell proportions, body mass index, smoking and alcohol consumption. The BMI-adjusted predictor of BMI was associated with breast cancer risk, OR per SD\u2009=\u20091.09, 95%CI: 1.01-1.17. The results for the alcohol and smoking methylation-based predictors were consistent with a null association. Risk did not appear to substantially vary by age at blood draw, time to diagnosis or tumour characteristics.We found no evidence that methylation-based measures of aging, smoking or alcohol consumption were associated with risk of breast cancer. A methylation-based marker of BMI was associated with risk and may provide insights into the underlying associations between BMI and breast cancer.",
  "Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers in females, with more than 450,000 deaths each year worldwide. Among the subtypes of breast cancer, basal-like breast cancer, also known as triple-negative breast cancer, shows the lowest survival rate and does not have effective treatments yet. Somatic mutations in the TP53 gene frequently occur across all breast cancer subtypes, but comparative analysis of gene correlations with respect to mutations in TP53 has not been done so far. The primary goal of this study is to identify gene correlations in two groups of breast cancer patients and to derive potential prognostic gene pairs for breast cancer. We partitioned breast cancer patients into two groups: one group with a mutated TP53 gene (mTP53) and the other with a wild-type TP53 gene (wtTP53). For every gene pair, we computed the hazard ratio using the Cox proportional hazard model and constructed gene correlation networks (GCNs) enriched with prognostic information. Our GCN is more informative than typical GCNs in the sense that it indicates the type of correlation between genes, the concordance index, and the prognostic type of a gene. Comparative analysis of correlation patterns and survival time of the two groups revealed several interesting findings. First, we found several new gene pairs with opposite correlations in the two GCNs and the difference in their correlation patterns was the most prominent in the basal-like subtype of breast cancer. Second, we obtained potential prognostic genes for breast cancer patients with a wild-type TP53 gene. From a comparative analysis of GCNs of mTP53 and wtTP53, we found several gene pairs that show significantly different correlation patterns in the basal-like breast cancer subtype and obtained prognostic genes for patients with a wild-type TP53 gene. The GCNs and prognostic genes identified in this study will be informative for the prognosis of survival and for selecting a drug target for breast cancer, in particular for basal-like breast cancer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to construct GCNs for breast cancer patients with or without mutations in the TP53 gene and to find prognostic genes accordingly.",
  "Breast cancer is a common cancer in the female population. Despite remarkable progress in the treatment of this cancer, its exact etiology is still unknown. Since the first evidence of an association between breast cancer and human papillomavirus (HPV) was provided in 1992, numerous studies have explored this subject but have reached contradictory results. In this review, the authors examine the existing evidence and hypotheses regarding the pathways whereby HPV infection can reach breast cells and the mediators linking HPV oncoproteins to breast cancer pathogenesis. Furthermore, the authors discuss contradictory findings regarding the association of HPV with breast cancer. Showing the link between HPV infection and increased genomic instability, reduced apoptosis, immune system dysfunction and progression of metastasis, the reviewed findings highlight the importance of active presence or history of HPV infection as a prognostic factor for breast tumor development.",
  "Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) was widely used to treat menopause-related symptoms in menopausal women. However, MHT therapies were controversial with the increased risk of breast cancer because of different estrogen and progestogen combinations, and the molecular basis behind this phenomenon is currently not understood. To address this issue, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the estrogen plus progestogens treatment (EPT) and estrogen treatment (ET) using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. As a result, a total of 96 upregulated DEGs were first identified. Seven DEGs related to the cell cycle (<i>CCNE2, CDCA5, RAD51, TCF19, KNTC1, MCM10</i>, and <i>NEIL3</i>) were validated by RT-qPCR. Specifically, these seven DEGs were increased in EPT compared to ET (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and had higher expression levels in breast cancer than adjacent normal tissues (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Next, we found that estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer patients with a higher <i>CNNE2</i> expression have a shorter overall survival time (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), while this effect was not observed in the other six DEGs (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). Interestingly, the molecular docking results showed that CCNE2 might bind to 17\u03b2-estradiol (-6.791 kcal/mol), progesterone (-6.847 kcal/mol), and medroxyprogesterone acetate (-6.314 kcal/mol) with a relatively strong binding affinity, respectively. Importantly, CNNE2 protein level could be upregulated with EPT and attenuated by estrogen receptor antagonist, acolbifene and had interactions with cancer driver genes (<i>AKT1</i> and <i>KRAS</i>) and high mutation frequency gene (<i>TP53</i> and <i>PTEN</i>) in breast cancer patients. In conclusion, the current study showed that <i>CCNE2, CDCA5, RAD51, TCF19, KNTC1, MCM10,</i> and <i>NEIL3</i> might contribute to EPT-related tumorigenesis in breast cancer, with <i>CCNE2</i> might be a sensitive risk indicator of breast cancer risk in women using MHT.",
  "Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) play an important role in the development of human cancer. Meanwhile, exosomes released by MSCs can mediate cell-cell communication by delivering microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs). Hence, this study aimed to explore the role of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cell (BMSC)-derived exosomal miR-551b-3p in breast cancer. In this study, we found that upregulation of miR-551b-5p suppressed the proliferation and migration and induced the apoptosis of breast cancer cells via downregulating tripartite motif-containing protein 31 (TRIM31). In addition, miR-551b-5p could be transferred from BMSCs to breast cancer cells via exosomes; BMSC-derived exosomal miR-551b-3p suppressed the proliferation and migration and promoted the apoptosis and oxidative stress of MDA-MB-231 cells via inhibiting TRIM31. Furthermore, a xenograft mouse model was used to explore the role of BMSC-derived exosomal miR-551b-3p in vivo. We found that BMSC-derived exosomal miR-551b-3p inhibited tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model of breast cancer in vivo. Collectively, these findings indicated that BMSC-derived exosomal miR-551b-3p could suppress the development of breast cancer via downregulating TRIM31. Thus, miR-551b-3p could serve as a potential target for the treatment of breast cancer.",
  "Increased mammographic breast density is a significant risk factor for breast cancer. It is not clear if it is also a risk factor for the development of contralateral breast cancer.The data were obtained from Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium and included women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ between ages 18 and 88 and years 1995 and 2009. Each case of contralateral breast cancer was matched with three controls based on year of first breast cancer diagnosis, race, and length of follow-up. A total of 847 cases and 2541 controls were included. The risk factors included in the study were mammographic breast density, age of first breast cancer diagnosis, family history of breast cancer, anti-estrogen treatment, hormone replacement therapy, menopausal status, and estrogen receptor status, all from the time of first breast cancer diagnosis. Both univariate analysis and multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis were performed.In the final multivariate model, breast density, family history of breast cancer, and anti-estrogen treatment remained significant with p values less than 0.01. Increasing breast density had a dose-dependent effect on the risk of contralateral breast cancer. Relative to 'almost entirely fat' category of breast density, the adjusted odds ratios (and p values) in the multivariate analysis for 'scattered density,' 'heterogeneously dense,' and 'extremely dense' categories were 1.65 (0.036), 2.10 (0.002), and 2.32 (0.001), respectively.Breast density is an independent and significant risk factor for development of contralateral breast cancer. This risk factor should contribute to clinical decision making.",
  "Quadruple negative breast cancer (QNBC), lacking the expression of ER (estrogen receptor), PR (progesterone receptor), HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor-2) and AR (androgen receptor), was regarded as one breast cancer subtype with the worst prognosis. Recently, the molecular features of QNBC are not well understood. Different from AR-positive triple-negative breast cancer, QNBC is insensitive to conventional chemotherapeutic agents and has no efficient treatment targets. However, QNBC has been shown to express unique proteins that may be amenable to use in the development of targeted therapies. Here we reviewed the features of QNBC and proteins that may serve as effective targets for QNBC treatment, such as ACSL4, SKP2, immune checkpoint inhibitors, EGFR, MicroRNA signatures and Engrailed 1.",
  "Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) 1A1 is a well-known marker for cancer stem cells (CSCs), characterized by self-renewal capacity and multidrug resistance in breast cancer. We developed a near-infrared turn-on fluorescence probe for ALDH1A1, C5S-A, which is suitable for observing and analyzing viable cells. Here, we demonstrated the utility of C5S-A in CSC research using breast cancer cell lines.To evaluate concordance between C5S-A and conventional stem cell markers, breast cancer cells sorted for ALDEFLUOR-positive cells and for CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> cell populations were stained with C5S-A. Tumorigenicity of C5S-A-positive cells was examined by mammosphere formation assay and subcutaneous transplantation to immunodeficient mice. Additionally, to determine how long fluorescence from a single staining remained observable, we cultured breast cancer cells for 5 days after C5S-A staining. We then evaluated whether C5S-A-positive cells possessed resistance to cytotoxic drugs by chronological imaging.C5S-A staining showed good concordance with conventional breast CSC markers, and good utility for research into CSC characteristics in breast cancer cell lines, including tumorigenesis. Additionally, C5S-A was observable for more than 3 days with a single staining. Using this property, we then confirmed that C5S-A-positive cells possessed resistance to cytotoxic drugs, which is one of the characteristics of CSCs.We showed that C5S-A is suitable for CSC research using breast cancer cell lines, and confirmed its utility in observing cells over time.",
  "Persistent breast cancer disparities, particularly geographic disparities, may be explained by diagnostic practice patterns such as utilization of needle biopsy, a National Quality Forum-endorsed quality metric for breast cancer diagnosis. Our objective was to assess the relationship between patient- and facility-level factors and needle biopsy receipt among women with non-metastatic breast cancer in the United States.We examined characteristics of women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2004 and 2015 in the National Cancer Database. We assessed the relationship between patient- (e.g., race/ethnicity, stage, age, rurality) and facility-level (e.g., facility type, breast cancer case volume) factors with needle biopsy utilization via a mixed effects logistic regression model controlling for clustering by facility.In our cohort of 992,209 patients, 82.96% received needle biopsy. In adjusted models, the odds of needle biopsy receipt were higher for Hispanic (OR 1.04, Confidence Interval 1.01-1.08) and Medicaid patients (OR 1.04, CI 1.02-1.08), and for patients receiving care at Integrated Network Cancer Programs (OR 1.21, CI 1.02-1.43). Odds of needle biopsy receipt were lower for non-metropolitan patients (OR 0.93, CI 0.90-0.96), patients with cancer stage 0 or I (at least OR 0.89, CI 0.86-0.91), patients with comorbidities (OR 0.93, CI 0.91-0.94), and for patients receiving care at Community Cancer Programs (OR 0.84, CI 0.74-0.96).This study suggests a need to account for sociodemographic factors including rurality as predictors of utilization of evidence-based diagnostic testing, such as needle biopsy. Addressing inequities in breast cancer diagnosis quality may help improve breast cancer outcomes in underserved patients.",
  "Sentinel lymph node biopsy is omitted in older women (\u2265\u200970\u00a0years old) with clinical lymph node (LN)-negative hormone receptor-positive breast cancer as it does not influence adjuvant treatment decision-making. However, older women are heterogeneous in frailty while the chance of recurrence increase with improving longevity. Therefore, a biomarker that identifies LN metastasis may facilitate treatment decision-making. RUFY3 is associated with cancer progression. We evaluated RUFY3 expression level as a biomarker for LN-positive breast cancer in older women.Clinical and transcriptomic data of breast cancer patients were obtained from the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC, n\u2009=\u20091903) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, n\u2009=\u20091046) Pan-cancer study cohorts.A total of 510 (METABRIC) and 211 (TCGA) older women were identified. LN-positive breast cancer, which represented 51.4% (METABRIC) and 48.4% (TCGA), demonstrated worse disease-free, disease-specific, and overall survival. RUFY3 levels were significantly lower in LN-positive tumors regardless of age. The area under the curve for the receiver operator characteristic (AUC-ROC) curves showed RUFY3-predicted LN metastasis. Low RUFY3 enriched oxidative phosphorylation, DNA repair, MYC targets, unfolded protein response, and mtorc1 signaling gene sets, was associated with T helper type 1 cell infiltration, and with intratumor heterogeneity and fraction altered. Low RUFY3 expression was associated with LN-positive breast cancer and with worse disease-specific survival among older women.Older women with breast cancers who had\u00a0low expression level of RUFY3 were more frequently diagnosed with LN-positive tumors, which translated into worse prognosis.",
  "We administered a questionnaire survey to assess the available clinical resources for the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer and identify the issues faced by rural hospitals in the Tohoku region in Japan.The term rural hospital was defined by the following three criteria: the facility is a certified regional cancer center and hospital, no breast specialist is on staff, and\u2009\u2265\u200910 breast surgeries per year have been performed. Thirty-eight rural hospitals were eligible, and each was sent a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 26 questions by mail.Responses were received from 29 of the 38 hospitals. Most of the hospitals had adequate facilities for diagnosis and treatment, but they needed specialists' support for\u2009\u2265\u20092\u00a0days per month. Approximately half of the hospitals indicated that applying resources for diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer, especially during planning of treatment and management of advanced breast cancer patients, was a burden. Interestingly, the hospitals felt that being able to provide treatment to their patients was more ideal rather than referring them to urban hospital like the prefectural cancer center and hospital providing specialized cancer treatment.The surveyed rural hospitals needed practical and knowledge-based support from specialists. Unfortunately, the number of specialists is currently insufficient in Tohoku. Increased number of certified physicians, clinical pathways for sharing patient's information and updated knowledge, and information and communication technology for treatment with specialists' intervention in rural hospitals may solve issues in Tohoku.",
  "Whether a first-degree family history of others cancers (FHOC) than breast or ovarian cancer (BOC) is associated with breast cancer prognosis remains unknown. Thus, the aim of the present study was to clarify this issue.Women who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer at the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from 2010 to 2013 were included in the study. The demographic and clinicopathological characteristics of these patients were extracted. FHOC was considered positive for any patient who had a relative who had been diagnosed with cancer other than BOC. Disease-free survival (DFS) was calculated based on the date of diagnosis. DFS was analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model.A total of 434 breast cancer patients were included in this study. Among these patients, 61 (14.06%) had a positive FHOC in first-degree relatives. Patients with a positive FHOC tended to have HER2-positive breast cancer (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). In the survival analysis, FHOC was associated with poor DFS in both univariate (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.21 (1.28-3.83), 95% CI: 1.28-3.83, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and multivariate (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.50, 95% CI: 1.24-5.04, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) analyses, especially in patients with luminal A subtypes.The results demonstrated an increased risk of recurrence in breast cancer patients with FHOC, especially in patients with luminal A subtype.",
  "With an aging society, Korean women \u226570 years of age are increasingly being diagnosed with breast cancer.To investigate the clinicopathological and biological characteristics of breast cancer in elderly Korean women and compare them with breast cancer in elderly (\u226570 years) women globally and in Korean women of all ages.We retrospectively reviewed the clinicopathological and biological features of breast cancer in elderly Korean women (\u226570 years; n =\u00a087) who sought treatment during 2004-2014 from a single institution. These data were indirectly compared with data of Korean women of all ages (nationwide Korean Breast Cancer Registry) or elderly women globally (meta-analysis).Compared to elderly women with breast cancer globally, Korean elderly women had a more symptomatic presentation, lower ER expression, and overexpression or amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Compared to Korean women of all ages with breast cancer, elderly Korean women presented with advanced tumor stages, larger tumor size, more lymph node involvement, and more luminal B and basal-like subtypes.Breast cancer had a more aggressive clinicopathological and biological characteristics in elderly Korean women than in Korean women of all ages or elderly women globally.",
  "PI3K/mTOR signaling is frequently upregulated in breast cancer making inhibitors of this pathway highly promising anticancer drugs. However, PI3K-inhibitors have a low therapeutic index. Therefore, finding novel combinatory treatment options represents an important step towards clinical implementation of PI3K pathway inhibition in breast cancer therapy. Here, we propose proteases as potential synergistic partners with simultaneous PI3K inhibition in breast cancer cells.We performed mRNA expression studies and unbiased functional genetic synthetic lethality screens by a miR-E based knockdown system targeting all genome-encoded proteases, i.e. the degradome of breast cancer cells. Importantly theses RNA interference screens were done in combination with two PI3K pathway inhibitors. Protease hits were validated in human and murine breast cancer cell lines as well as in non-cancerous cells by viability and growth assays.The degradome-wide genetic screens identified 181 proteases that influenced susceptibility of murine breast cancer cells to low dose PI3K inhibition. Employing independently generated inducible knockdown cell lines we validated 12 protease hits in breast cancer cells. In line with the known tumor promoting function of these proteases we demonstrated Usp7 and Metap2 to be important for murine and human breast cancer cell growth and discovered a role for Metap1 in this context. Most importantly, we demonstrated that Usp7, Metap1 or Metap2 knockdown combined with simultaneous PI3K inhibition resulted in synergistic impairment of murine and human breast cancer cell growth Conclusion: We successfully established proteases as combinatory targets with PI3K inhibition in human and murine breast cancer cells. Usp7, Metap1 and Metap2 are synthetic lethal partners of simultaneous protease/PI3K inhibition, which may refine future breast cancer therapy.",
  "To develop novel deep learning network (DLN) with the incorporation of the automatic segmentation network (ASN) for morphological analysis and determined the performance for diagnosis breast cancer in automated breast ultrasound (ABUS).A total of 769 breast tumors were enrolled in this study and were randomly divided into training set and test set at 600 vs. 169. The novel DLNs (Resent v2, ResNet50 v2, ResNet101 v2) added a new ASN to the traditional ResNet networks and extracted morphological information of breast tumors. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), and average precision (AP) were calculated. The diagnostic performances of novel DLNs were compared with those of two radiologists with different experience.The ResNet34 v2 model had higher specificity (76.81%) and PPV (82.22%) than the other two, the ResNet50 v2 model had higher accuracy (78.11%) and NPV (72.86%), and the ResNet101 v2 model had higher sensitivity (85.00%). According to the AUCs and APs, the novel ResNet101 v2 model produced the best result (AUC 0.85 and AP 0.90) compared with the remaining five DLNs. Compared with the novice radiologist, the novel DLNs performed better. The F1 score was increased from 0.77 to 0.78, 0.81, and 0.82 by three novel DLNs. However, their diagnostic performance was worse than that of the experienced radiologist.The novel DLNs performed better than traditional DLNs and may be helpful for novice radiologists to improve their diagnostic performance of breast cancer in ABUS.\u2022 A novel automatic segmentation network to extract morphological information was successfully developed and implemented with ResNet deep learning networks. \u2022 The novel deep learning networks in our research performed better than the traditional deep learning networks in the diagnosis of breast cancer using ABUS images. \u2022 The novel deep learning networks in our research may be useful for novice radiologists to improve diagnostic performance.",
  "Type of axillary surgery in breast cancer (BC) patients who convert from cN\u00a0+\u00a0to ycN0 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is still debated. The aim of the present study was to develop and validate a preoperative predictive nomogram to select those patients with a low risk of residual axillary disease after NAC, in whom axillary surgery could be minimized.1950 clinically node-positive BC patients from 11 Breast Units, treated by NAC and subsequent surgery, were included from 2005 to 2020. Patients were divided in two groups: those who achieved nodal pCR vs. those with residual nodal disease after NAC. The cohort was divided into training and validation set with a geographic separation criterion. The outcome was to identify independent predictors of axillary pathologic complete response (pCR).Independent predictive factors associated to nodal pCR were axillary clinical complete response (cCR) after NAC (OR 3.11, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), ER-/HER2+ (OR 3.26, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) or ER+/HER2+ (OR 2.26, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0002) or ER-/HER2- (OR 1.89, p\u00a0=\u00a00.009) BC, breast cCR (OR 2.48, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), Ki67\u00a0>\u00a014% (OR 0.52, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0005), and tumor grading G2 (OR 0.35, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) or G3 (OR 0.29, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0003). The nomogram showed a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 73% (AUC 0.77, 95%CI 0.75-0.80). After external validation the accuracy of the nomogram was confirmed.The accuracy makes this freely-available, nomogram-based online tool useful to predict nodal pCR after NAC, translating the concept of tailored axillary surgery also in this setting of patients.",
  "Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer in the world. It is the commonest type of cancer in Ethiopia. Cognitive problems are common among breast cancer patients. The study aimed to assess cognitive functioning and its associated factors among breast cancer patients at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia 2020.Institution-based comparative cross-sectional study was conducted. Study subjects were 117 breast cancer patients on chemotherapy and 117 women without breast cancer who volunteered for the study. Data was collected from May-June 2020. The Mini-mental status exam (MMSE) was used to assess cognitive functioning. Data were entered into Epi Data version 4.6.0.2 and analyzed using STATA version 14 software. Univariable and multivariable linear regression model was fitted to identify factors associated with cognitive functioning. A two-tailed p-value less than 0.05 was used to declare statistical significance.Among the total breast cancer patients 41.9% were diagnosed with earlier sage of the diseases (stage I and II), while the rest 58.1% were diagnosed with stage III and stage IV breast cancer. A significant difference in the MMSE score was observed among breast cancer patients and controls (19.76\u2009\u00b1\u20095.29, 25.18\u2009\u00b1\u20094.68 p\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.0001) respectively. In multivariable linear regression analysis being non-breast cancer (Adjusted beta coefficient (Adj.\u03b2.coff). = 3.34, 95% CI (1.92-4.76) p\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.001), hemoglobin gm/dl (Adj.\u03b2.coff =0.34, 95% CI (0.04-0.63) p\u2009=\u20090.02), and primary education (Adj.\u03b2.coff =2.98 95%CI (1.16-4.96) p\u2009=\u20090.001) secondary level and more education (Adj.\u03b2.coff\u2009=\u20095.47, 95%CI (3.51-7.28) p\u2009<\u20090.001) were significantly associated with MMSE cognitive score.Breast cancer patients had lower mean MMSE scores when compared to non-breast cancer women. Higher hemoglobin level and higher level of education increase the MMSE cognitive score. Clinicians should incorporate routine screening of cognitive functioning for breast cancer patients and further study is required to evaluate cognitive impairment among breast cancer patients in Ethiopia.",
  "Tumor cells have various effects and dominance over other healthy cells. Cancer cells alter the cell program in healthy cells by secreting exosomes containing microRNAs involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). They can migrate to distant organs and establish a pre-metastatic niche. The purpose of this study was to determine the expression of miRNA-21-5p and miRNA-10b-5p, both of which are involved in EMT, in breast cancer-derived exosomes of various grades in order to identify new biomarkers involved in breast cancer progression.In this study, a blood sample was taken from 60 patients with grades I, II, or III breast cancer, as well as twenty healthy individuals as a control group. The exosomes were then purified from serum samples, and their relative expression of miRNA-21-5p and miRNA-10b-5p was determined using the real-time PCR method.miRNA-21-5p expression was significantly increased in patients with breast cancer grades I, II, and III compared to the control group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), respectively, as was miRNA-10b-5p expression in patients with breast cancer grades I, II, and III compared to the control group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), respectively.Our results show that both microRNAs increase as cells lose their differentiation and become more invasive, which is evidence of cancer progression. Hence, both microRNAs may have the potential to be used alone or in combination with other biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer.",
  "Estrogen receptor (ER) expression in breast cancer plays an essential role in carcinogenesis and disease progression. Recently, tumors with low level (1%-10%) of ER expression have been separately defined as ER low positive (ERlow). It is suggested that ERlow tumors might be morphologically and behaviorally different from tumors with high ER expression (ERhigh).Retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort database was performed. Patients who underwent curative surgery for early breast cancer and had available medical records were included for analysis. Difference in clinicopathological characteristics, endocrine responsiveness and five-year recurrence-free survival was evaluated between different ER subgroups (ERhigh, ERlow, and ER-negative [ER-]).A total of 2,162 breast cancer patients were included in the analysis, Tis and T1 stage. Among them, 1,654 (76.5%) were ERhigh, 54 (2.5%) were ERlow, and 454 (21.0%) were ER- patients. ERlow cases were associated with smaller size, higher histologic grade, positive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, negative progesterone receptor, and higher Ki-67 expression. Recurrence rate was highest in ER- tumors and was inversely proportional to ER expression. Recurrence-free survival was not affected by hormonal therapy in the ERlow group (p=0.418).ERlow breast cancer showed distinct clinicopathological features. ERlow tumors seemed to have higher recurrence rates compared to ERhigh tumors, and they showed no significant benefit from hormonal therapy. Future large scale prospective studies are necessary to validate the treatment options for ERlow breast cancer.",
  "To compare antim\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) patterns by cancer status and treatment exposures across 6 years after incident breast cancer using administrative data.In a cross-sectional design, AMH levels in patients who developed incident breast cancer between ages 15-39 years during 2005-2019 were matched 1:10 to levels in females without cancer in the OptumLabs Data Warehouse. Modeled AMH patterns were compared among cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy, non-cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy, no chemotherapy, and no breast cancer groups.Commercially insured females in the United States.Females with and without breast cancer.Breast cancer, cyclophosphamide- and non-cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy.AMH levels.A total of 233 patients with breast cancer (mean age, 34 years; standard deviation, 3.7 years) contributed 278 AMH levels over a median of 2 years (range, 0-6.7 years) after diagnosis; 52% received cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy, 17% received non-cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy (80% platinum-based), and 31% received no chemotherapy. A total of 2,777 matched females without cancer contributed 2,780 AMH levels. The pattern of AMH levels differed among the 4 groups. Among females without cancer and breast cancer survivors who did not undergo chemotherapy, AMH declined linearly over time. In contrast, among those who received cyclophosphamide-based and noncyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy, a nonlinear pattern of AMH level of initial fall during chemotherapy, followed by an increase over 2-4 years, and then by a plateau over 1-2 years before a decline was observed.In breast cancer survivors, AMH levels from administrative data supported ovarian toxicity of non-cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in breast cancer and efficiently depicted the timing and duration of changes in ovarian reserve to reflect the residual reproductive lifespan.",
  "The immune system seems to play a fundamental role in breast cancer responsiveness to chemotherapy. We investigated two peripheral indicators of immunity/inflammation, i.e. neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), in order to reveal a possible relationship with pathological complete response (pCR) in patients with early or locally advanced breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). We retrospectively analyzed 373 consecutive patients affected by breast cancer and candidates to NACT. The complete blood cell count before starting NACT was evaluated to calculate NLR and PLR. ROC curve analysis determined threshold values of 2.42 and 104.47 as best cut-off values for NLR and PLR, respectively. The relationships between NLR/PLR and pCR, along with other clinical-pathological characteristics, were evaluated by Pearson's \u03c7 2 or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using a logistic regression model. NLR and PLR were not significantly associated with pCR if analyzed separately. However, when combining NLR and PLR, patients with a NLR<sup>low</sup>/PLR<sup>low</sup> profile achieved a significantly higher rate of pCR compared to those with NLR<sup>high</sup> and/or PLR<sup>high</sup> (OR 2.29, 95% CI 1.22-4.27, p 0.009). Importantly, the predictive value of NLR<sup>low</sup>/PLR<sup>low</sup> was independent from common prognostic factors such as grading, Ki67, and molecular subtypes. The combination of NLR and PLR may reflect patients' immunogenic phenotype. Low levels of both NLR and PLR may thus indicate a status of immune system activation that may predict pCR in breast cancer patients treated with NACT.",
  "Lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin V has previously been shown to exhibit elevated expression in breast cancer tissue and be associated with distant metastasis. Research has also identified that cathepsin V expression is elevated in tumour tissues from numerous other malignancies, but despite this, there has been limited examination of the function of this protease in cancer. Here we investigate the role of cathepsin V in breast cancer in order to delineate the molecular mechanisms by which this protease contributes to tumourigenesis.Lentiviral transductions were used to generate shRNA cell line models, with cell line validation undertaken using RQ-PCR and Western blotting. Phenotypic changes of tumour cell biology were examined using clonogenic and invasion assays. The relationship between GATA3 expression and cathepsin V was primarily analysed using Western blotting. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate catalytic mutant and shRNA-resistant constructs to confirm the role of cathepsin V in regulating GATA3 expression.We have identified that elevated cathepsin V expression is associated with reduced survival in ER-positive breast cancers. Cathepsin V regulates the expression of GATA3 in ER-positive breast cancers, through promoting its degradation via the proteasome. We have determined that depletion of cathepsin V results in elevated pAkt-1 and reduced GSK-3\u03b2 expression, which rescues GATA3 from proteasomal degradation.In this study, we have identified that cysteine protease cathepsin V can suppress GATA3 expression in ER-positive breast cancers by facilitating its turnover via the proteasome. Therefore, targeting cathepsin V may represent a potential therapeutic strategy in ER-positive breast cancers, by restoring GATA3 protein expression, which is associated with a more favourable clinical outcome.",
  "Trials of risk estimation in breast cancer screening programmes, in order to identify women at higher risk and offer extra screening/preventive measures, are ongoing. It may also be feasible to introduce less frequent screening for women at low-risk of breast cancer. This study aimed to establish views of women at low-risk of breast cancer regarding the acceptability of extending breast screening intervals for low-risk women beyond 3 y.Semi-structured interviews were used to explore views of low-risk women, where \"low-risk\" was defined as less than 2% estimated 10-year risk of breast cancer aged >\u200946\u2009years. Low-risk women were identified via the BC-Predict study, where following routine screening, women were given their 10-year risk of breast cancer by letter, along with additional information explaining breast cancer risk factors. To gain diversity of views, purposive sampling by ethnicity and socioeconomic background was used to recruit women. Data were analysed using thematic analysis.Twenty-three women participated in individual interviews. Three themes are reported: (1) A good opportunity to receive risk estimation, where women found it worthwhile to receive a low-risk result although some were surprised if expecting a higher risk result; (2) Multi-faceted acceptability of extended screening intervals, with reactions to less frequent screening dependent on whether women were confident in being low-risk status and current safety evidence, (3) Passive approval versus informed choice, highlighting that women found it difficult to consider choosing less frequent screening without professionals' recommendations, as they generally viewed attending breast screening as positive.Risk assessment and receiving a low-risk of breast cancer is acceptable although, further research is required with more diverse samples of women. Any recommendation of less frequent screening in this risk group should be evidence-based in order to be acceptable. Communication needs to be carefully developed, with a focus on ensuring informed choice, prior to trialling any extended screening recommendations in future studies.",
  "Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and new biomarkers are needed for more accurate classification and prediction of prognosis. The goal of this study is to assess the expression of breast cancer classification genes, to identify new molecular signatures in different intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer and to correlate their expression with different clinical variables. The study included 84 female patients newly diagnosed with non-metastatic breast cancer at the outpatient clinic at the National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Egypt. Detection of 17 breast cancer classification genes was done using RT-PCR in tumor and normal tissues. Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER2, and Ki67 expression were assessed using IHC assay for intrinsic subtyping. Combined expression of FOXA1 and GATA3 was statistically higher in luminal subtypes in comparison to non-luminal subtypes. In Luminal A subtype; GRB7, EGFR, PTGS2, ID1, and KRT5 were significantly downregulated. FOXA1 and GATA3 were significantly upregulated in luminal B subtype, where EGFR and PTGS2 were significantly downregulated. While ESR1, EGFR, KRT5 and PTGS2 showed significantly low expression in tumor tissue in Her2 enriched subtype, TFF3 was significantly downregulated in triple negative subtype. GATA3 and FOXA1 expression exhibited significant correlation with tumor grade. Furthermore, GATA3, FOXA1, ESR1, and ID1 were also correlated significantly with staging of the tumor. Combined expression of ESR1, FOXA1 and GATA3 represents a molecular signature of luminal subtypes. Long term follow-up is needed to investigate the prognostic effect of breast cancer classification genes found in this study.",
  "Metastases are the main cause of cancer-related mortality in breast cancer. Although significant progress has been made in the field of tumor metastasis, the exact molecular mechanisms involved in tumor metastasis are still unclear. Here, we report that ATOH8-V1, a novel isoform of ATOH8, is highly expressed in breast cancer and is a negative prognostic indicator of survival for patients. Forced expression of ATOH8-V1 dramatically enhances, while silencing of ATOH8-V1 decreases the metastasis of breast cancer cell lines. Moreover, ATOH8-V1 directly binds to the RhoC promoter and stimulates the expression of RhoC, which in turn enhances the metastasis of breast cancer. Altogether, our data demonstrate that ATOH8-V1 is a novel pro-metastatic factor that enhances cancer metastasis, suggesting that ATOH8-V1 is a potential therapeutic target for treatment of metastatic cancers.",
  "Breast cancer grading methods based on hematoxylin-eosin (HE) stained pathological images can be summarized into two categories. The first category is to directly extract the pathological image features for breast cancer grading. However, unlike the coarse-grained problem of breast cancer classification, breast cancer grading is a fine-grained classification problem, so general methods cannot achieve satisfactory results. The second category is to apply the three evaluation criteria of the Nottingham Grading System (NGS) separately, and then integrate the results of the three criteria to obtain the final grading result. However, NGS is only a semiquantitative evaluation method, and there may be far more image features related to breast cancer grading. In this paper, we proposed a Nuclei-Guided Network (NGNet) for breast invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) grading in pathological images. The proposed nuclei-guided attention module plays the role of nucleus attention, so as to learn more nuclei-related feature representations for breast IDC grading. In addition, the proposed nuclei-guided fusion module in the fusion process of different branches can further enable the network to focus on learning nuclei-related features. Overall, under the guidance of nuclei-related features, the entire NGNet can learn more fine-grained features for breast IDC grading. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is better than that of state-of-the-art method. In addition, we released a well-labeled dataset with 3644 pathological images for breast IDC grading. This dataset is currently the largest publicly available breast IDC grading dataset and can serve as a benchmark to facilitate a broader study of breast IDC grading.",
  "Eribulin mesylate (eribulin) is indicated for patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who have previously received at least two chemotherapies in the US and for patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) or MBC who have progressed after at least one chemotherapy in the European Union (EU). In both indications, prior therapy should include an anthracycline and a taxane in adjuvant or metastatic setting. Numerous studies evaluated eribulin in real-world (RW) breast cancer populations to reinforce its consistent effectiveness beyond registration randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that reported median overall survival (OS) of 13.1 and 15.9\u2009months. In this systematic literature review (SLR), we summarize the cumulative evidence on eribulin's RW effectiveness in LABC/MBC.We searched through Medline/PubMed and Embase databases between 2012 and 2019 for articles reporting RW eribulin use in the second- or third-line or later LABC/MBC setting. Because eribulin showed greatest OS benefits in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) in RCTs, we also reviewed this tumor subtype. OS and progression-free survival (PFS) were the effectiveness outcomes of interest.Overall, 34 journal articles or abstracts met the selection criteria. Median OS ranged between 6.9 and 28.0\u2009months; median PFS varied from 2.3 to 14.7\u2009months. Eight studies reported OS outcomes for TNBC patients, and median OS ranged between 3.0 and 23.0\u2009months.The SLR showed high variability in OS and to a lesser extent in PFS associated with eribulin use in RW setting. Despite heterogeneity in line of use and patient subtypes, this SLR supports effectiveness of eribulin for LABC/MBC in clinical practice.",
  "Acquired metastasis and invasion of cancer cells during radiotherapy are in part due to induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell (CSC) properties, which are mediated by TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Here we evaluated the anti-metastatic therapeutic potential of vactosertib, an orally bioavailable TGF-\u03b2 type I receptor (activin receptor-like kinase 5, ALK5) inhibitor, via suppression of radiation-induced EMT and CSC properties, oxidative stress generation, and breast to lung metastasis in a breast cancer mouse model and breast cancer cell lines.Co-treatment of vactosertib with radiation was investigated in the 4T1-Luc allografted BALB/c syngeneic mouse model and in 4T1-Luc and MDA-MB-231 cells. The anti-metastatic therapeutic potential of vactosertib in breast cancer was investigated using fluorescence immunohistochemistry, real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, wound healing assay, mammosphere formation assay, and lung metastasis analysis <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>.Radiation induced TGF-\u03b2 signaling, EMT markers (Vimentin, Fibronectin, Snail, Slug, Twist, and N-cadherin), CSC properties (expression of pluripotent stem cell regulators, mammosphere forming ability), reactive oxygen species markers (NOX4, 4-HNE), and motility of breast cancer cells <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Vactosertib attenuated the radiation-induced EMT and CSC properties by inhibiting ROS stress in breast cancer. Moreover, vactosertib combined with radiation showed a significant anti-metastatic effect with suppression of breast to lung metastasis <i>in vivo</i>.These results indicate that inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 signaling with vactosertib in breast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy would be an attractive strategy for the prevention of cancer metastasis and recurrence.",
  "To develop a nomogram for predicting the possibility of four or more positive nodes in breast cancer patients with 1-3 positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLN).Retrospective analysis of data of patients from two institutions was conducted. The inclusion criteria were: invasive breast cancer; clinically node negative; received lumpectomy or mastectomy plus SLN biopsy followed by axillary lymph node dissection (ALND); and pathologically confirmed T1-2 tumor, with 1-3 positive SLNs. Patients from one institution formed the training group and patients from the other the validation group. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the predictors of four or more positive nodes. These predictors were used to build the nomogram. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated to assess the accuracy of the model.Of the 1480 patients (966 patients in the training group, 514 in the validation group), 306 (20.7%) had four or more positive nodes. Multivariate stepwise logistic regression showed number of positive (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and negative SLN (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001), extracapsular extension (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001), pT stage (p\u00a0=\u00a0.016), and tumor location in outer upper quadrant (p\u00a0=\u00a0.031) to be independent predictors of four or more positive nodes. The nomogram was built using these five factors. The AUC was 0.845 in the training group and 0.804 in the validation group.The proposed nomogram appears to accurately estimate the likelihood of four or more positive nodes and could help radiation oncologists to decide on use of regional nodal irradiation (RNI) for breast cancer patients with 1-3 positive nodes but no ALND.",
  "Mammographic dense area (MDA) is an established predictor of future breast cancer risk. Recent studies have found that risk prediction might be improved by redefining MDA in effect at higher-than-conventional intensity thresholds. We assessed whether such higher-intensity MDA measures gave stronger prediction of subsequent contralateral breast cancer (CBC) risk using the Women's Environment, Cancer, and Radiation Epidemiology (WECARE) Study, a population-based CBC case-control study of \u22651\u00a0year survivors of unilateral breast cancer diagnosed between 1990 and 2008. Three measures of MDA for the unaffected contralateral breast were made at the conventional intensity threshold (\"Cumulus\") and at two sequentially higher-intensity thresholds (\"Altocumulus\" and \"Cirrocumulus\") using the CUMULUS software and mammograms taken up to 3\u2009years prior to the first breast cancer diagnosis. The measures were fitted separately and together in multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models of CBC (252 CBC cases and 271 unilateral breast cancer controls). The strongest association with CBC was MDA defined using the highest intensity threshold, Cirrocumulus (odds ratio per adjusted SD [OPERA] 1.40, 95% CI 1.13-1.73); and the weakest association was MDA defined at the conventional threshold, Cumulus (1.32, 95% CI 1.05-1.66). In a model fitting the three measures together, the association of CBC with Cirrocumulus was unchanged (1.40, 95% CI 0.97-2.05), and the lower brightness measures did not contribute to the CBC model fit. These results suggest that MDA defined at a high-intensity threshold is a better predictor of CBC risk and has the potential to improve CBC risk stratification beyond conventional MDA measures.",
  "It can be difficult to establish the origin of a tumor in metastatic breast cancer (MBC), especially with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) or high-grade features. We evaluated the diagnostic utility of GATA3, SOX10, and PAX8 panels in MBC by comparing their expression in each molecular subtype of MBC.We evaluated 84 MBC and 37 primary TNBC cases using GATA3, SOX10, and PAX8 staining in whole tissue sections.GATA3 was least sensitive in the detection of metastatic TNBC (metastatic non-TNBC, 0.95; metastatic TNBC, 0.37). SOX10 had the lowest overall sensitivity (0.12) but was elevated in metastatic TNBC, even higher than GATA3 (0.59 vs. 0.37). The combination of GATA3, SOX10, and PAX8 expression showed the highest detection rate (MBC, 0.94; metastatic non-TNBC, 0.95; metastatic TNBC, 0.93).We recommend combining GATA3, SOX10, PAX8 expression profiling to confirm breast as the site of origin in metastatic MBC.",
  "People with advanced breast cancer (ABC) in New Zealand (NZ) have a poorer five-year survival than their peers in other developed countries. Comparisons of ABC care in NZ with other countries suggest that NZ is sometimes out of line with international standards and that inequities exist within the NZ healthcare system. Our aim was to develop nationwide consensus guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of ABC that are uniquely suited for the NZ context and can be applied across the nation. We describe the process of creating, voting on, and disseminating the guidelines, and provide insight into how we can better optimize these processes for the NZ context in the future.The ABC5 ESO-ESMO consensus guidelines were used and adapted to the NZ clinical context. A panel of breast cancer clinicians voted on these guidelines using the same model of membership representation as ABC5.Overall consensus was equally high between ABC5 and ABC-NZ. Four NZ specific guidelines were introduced. The European-style panel discussion needs some adaptations for the NZ situation and a wider and more thorough consultation process, before voting begins, is preferred. The NZ Breast Special Interest Group has endorsed and agreed to take ownership of these and future guidelines and to facilitate the next iteration of the ABC-NZ guidelines meeting.The process was successful in creating the guidelines but can be improved in future meetings to streamline the process of creating and updating guidelines in the manner most suited to the NZ context and audience.",
  "A prognostic model combining biomarkers of metaphase-anaphase transition of the cell cycle was developed for invasive breast cancer. The prognostic value and clinical applicability of the model was evaluated in comparison with the routine prognosticators of invasive breast carcinoma.The study comprised 1135 breast cancer patients with complete clinical data and up to 22-year follow-up. Regulators of metaphase-anaphase transition were detected immunohistochemically and the biomarkers with the strongest prognostic impacts were combined into a prognostic model. The prognostic value of the model was tested and evaluated in separate patient materials originating from two Finnish breast cancer centers.The designed model comprising immunoexpressions of Securin, Separase and Cdk1 identified 8.4-fold increased risk of breast cancer mortality (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). A survival difference exceeding 15\u2009years was observed between the majority (>\u200975%) of patients resulting with favorable as opposed to unfavorable outcome of the model. Along with nodal status, the model showed independent prognostic impact for all breast carcinomas and for subgroups of luminal, N+ and N- disease.The impact of the proposed prognostic model in predicting breast cancer survival was comparable to nodal status. However, the model provided additional information in N- breast carcinoma in identifying patients with aggressive course of disease, potentially in need of adjuvant treatments. Concerning N+, in turn, the model could provide evidence for withholding chemotherapy from patients with favorable outcome.",
  "As a prevalent tumor among women, breast cancer is still an incurable disease due to drug resistance. In this study, we report microRNA-221 to have a significant effect on breast cancer resistance to adriamycin. The microRNA-221 is elevated in tumor tissue compared with nearby nontumor samples, as well as in breast cancer cell line with adriamycin resistance (MCF-7/ADR) compared to its parental line (MCF-7) and the normal breast epithelial cell line (MCF-10A). Enforced level of microRNA-221 promotes cancer resistance to adriamycin, which in turn sustains cell survival and exacerbates malignant formation. Reciprocally, the silence of microRNA-221 in cancer cells augments the sensitivity to chemotherapy, thereby resulting in enhanced apoptosis of MCF-7/ADR cells. Mechanistically, we identify PTEN as a direct target of microRNA-221, which was conversely associated with a microRNA-221 level in breast tumors. The knock-down of PTEN partially reversed the stimulatory role of microRNA-221 in the modulation of the Akt/mTOR signaling. Taken together, these findings suggest microRNA-221 suppresses PTEN transcription and activates Akt/mTOR pathway, which in turn enhances breast cancer resistance to adriamycin and promotes cancer development. Our data thus illuminate the microRNA-221/PTEN axis may act as a promising strategy for the treatment of chemotherapy-resistant breast tumors.",
  "Breast cancer is the most common cancer in females, and to date, the mortality rate of breast cancer metastasis cannot be ignored. The metastasis of breast cancer is a complex, staged process, and the pattern of metastatic spread is not random. The pre-metastatic niche, as an organ-specific home for metastasis, is a favourable environment for tumour cell colonization. As detection techniques improve, the role of the pre-metastatic niche in breast cancer metastasis is being uncovered. sEVs (small extracellular vesicles) can deliver cargo, which is vital for the formation of pre-metastatic niches. sEVs participate in multiple aspects of creating a distant microenvironment to promote tumour invasion, including the secretion of inflammatory molecules, immunosuppression, angiogenesis and enhancement of vascular permeability, as well as regulation of the stromal environment. Here, we discuss the multifaceted mechanisms through which breast cancer-derived sEVs contribute to pre-metastatic niches. In addition, sEVs as biomarkers and antimetastatic therapies are also discussed, particularly their use in transporting exosomal microRNAs. The study of sEVs may provide insight into immunotherapy and targeted therapies for breast cancer, and we also provide an overview of their potential role in antitumour metastasis. Video Abstract.",
  "Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is associated with extensive axillary dissection. Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) based on breast lymphatics level (BLL) was proposed to minimize the surgical extent for node-positive breast cancer patients.A total of 156 consecutive sentinel lymph node-positive (SLN+) or clinically node-positive (cN+) patients underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) with indocyanine green and methylene blue (MB). The SLNs were injected with 0.1\u2009ml\u2009MB before removal, and a standard ALND was subsequently performed. The nodes adjacent to the blue-stained axillary lymph nodes from the breast (bALNs) were sent for pathological examination separately by resecting serial tissue every 0.5\u2009cm away from the marginal blue-stained bALNs. Then, a pilot study comparing ALND based on BLL and standard ALND was performed.BLL were successfully identified in 20 SLN+ (100%) and 134 cN+ (98.5%) patients. The median number of BLL was four, ranging from three to six. A horizontal line 1.0\u2009cm away from the superior blue-stained bALN and a vertical line 1.0\u2009cm away from the medial blue-stained bALN formed BLL II, III, and IV. All of the additional positive nodes were within 1.0\u2009cm of the blue-stained bALNs. The minimized axillary dissection should resect upwards from the lowest BLL that contains the first confirmed negative blue-stained bALNs. In the pilot study, no patient developed axillary recurrence.The ALND surgical procedure based on BLL could minimize the surgical extent for pathological node-positive breast cancer patients and potentially reduce the BCRL rate.ChiCTR1800014247 .",
  "Familial clustering of age at onset would have implications for both personalized screening and aetiology, but has not been studied for breast cancer.We prospectively studied a cohort of 23\u00a0145 sisters to explore whether their breast cancer risk changed near the age at diagnosis of a previously affected older sister. Using an age-time-dependent variable in a Cox regression model, we estimated hazard ratios for breast cancer when participants were near their sister's diagnosis age, relative to similarly aged women whose sister was diagnosed at a very different age. To rule out a correlation driven by young-onset familial cancer, we separately investigated women who had enrolled at age 50 or older.Of the 23\u00a0145 women, 1412 developed breast cancer during follow-up (median 9.5\u2009years). The estimated hazard ratio was 1.80 (95% confidence interval: 1.18, 2.74) at their sister's age at diagnosis, suggesting a substantial increase in risk compared with women of the same age but whose sister was diagnosed at a very different age. Restriction to women who enrolled at or after age 50 produced similar results.This familial clustering suggests that there may be important genetic and/or early environmental risk factors that influence the timing of breast cancer, even when onset is late in life. Personalized screening might need to account for the age at which a sister was earlier diagnosed with breast cancer.",
  "The BRCA1/2 gene is the most well-known and studied gene associated with hereditary breast cancer. BRCA1/2 genetic testing is widely performed in high-risk patients of hereditary breast cancer in Korea. This study aimed to investigate the clinicopathological characteristics of BRCA1/2 mutation-positive breast cancer patients.The clinical data of 188 Korean breast cancer patients who underwent genetic testing of BRCA1/2 mutation between March 2015 and February 2020 at Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. The characteristics of breast cancer according to the expression of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were analyzed using the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service guideline criteria and other clinicopathological factors.The factor associated with BRCA1/2 gene expression was cancer stage, and mutation expression was significantly decreased in stage I compared to stage 0 (p = 0.033; odds ratio [OR], 0.169; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.033-0.867), and there was a tendency to increase in stage II (p = 0.780; OR, 1.150; 95% CI, 0.432-3.064). BRCA1 was significantly associated with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (p = 0.004; OR, 5.887; 95% CI, 1.778-19.498). Gene expression of BRCA2 was significantly reduced under 40 years of age (p = 0.040; OR, 0.198; 95% CI, 0.042-0.930). There was no difference in disease-free survival (p = 0.900) and overall survival (p = 0.733) between the BRCA1/2 mutation-positive and -negative groups.In this study, the clinicopathological characteristics of breast cancer patients with BRCA1/2 gene mutations were identified. BRCA1 gene expression was highly correlated with TNBC. BRCA1/2 mutation did not have a poor prognosis regarding recurrence and death.",
  "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is one of the leading causes of death among females around the world. However, the molecular mechanism of the disease among TNBC patients remains to be further studied.In our study, four microarray data and two high throughput sequencing data were acquired from the GEO database, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between TNBC and normal tissues had been analyzed. Analysis of functional enrichment and pathway enrichment of DEGs was conducted by the Funrich software, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network gained from the STRING, and hub genes were confirmed by the Cytoscape. Kaplan-Meier plotter (KM plotter) online dataset had been used to analyze DEGs of overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS).In total, 1638 DEGs were gained in our study covering 984 upregulated and 654 downregulated genes. Moreover, a PPI network was constructed, and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), cyclin B1 (CCNB1), and cyclin A2 (CCNA2) were found as top genes with higher node degrees. CDK1, CCNA2, and CCNB1were obviously enriched in the cell cycle. The top upregulated genes including CDK1, CCNB1, CCNA2, and PLK1 were overexpressed in TNBC, and correlated with worse OS in breast cancer. High expression of CCNB1 was correlated with worse PFS in TNBC (HR\u2009=\u20091.42, 95% CI: 1.04-1.94, P\u2009=\u20090.028). Besides, there was a correlation between CCNB1 and CDK1 in TNBC, as well as between CCNA2 and CDK1 (r\u2009=\u20090.804, P\u2009<\u20090.001; r\u2009=\u20090.577, P\u2009<\u20090.001, respectively).Our results suggest that cyclin CDK1, CCNB1, and CCNA2 are overexpressed in TNBC and they could act as novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of TNBC.",
  "It remains unclear whether breast cancer subtypes are associated with clinical outcome in patients without any treatment including systemic and radiation therapy as an independent entity. Understanding the survival profiles among subtypes by treatment status could impact optimal selection of treatments.Patients were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer from the community hospitals across four geographical regions of the United States. Expression of hormone receptor (HR) and HER2 in tumor specimens from 1169 patients was centrally determined by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ; breast cancer was classified into HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup>, HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>+</sup>, triple-negative, and HER2<sup>+</sup> subtypes. Overall survival (OS) at a median follow-up of about 15\u00a0years among subtypes in untreated patients and those with systemic treatments and radiotherapy was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method and multivariable analysis adjusting for age, tumor size and grade, number of positive nodes, stage and breast cancer subtypes.Without treatment, breast cancer subtypes were not associated with OS (P\u2009=\u20090.983) and remained insignificant for prognosis by multivariable analysis after adjusting for confounders. This contrasted with a significant survival difference across the subtypes in patients with conventional therapies (P\u2009<\u20090.0001). Compared with HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> subtype, triple-negative subtype (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.11-2.04; P\u2009=\u20090.009) and HER2<sup>+</sup> subtype (HR 2.18, 95% CI 1.48-3.28; P\u2009=\u20090.0001) were significantly associated with worse survival by multivariable analyses.Breast cancer subtypes are not associated with survival in untreated patient population and, in contrast, significantly associated with prognosis in patients with conventional therapy. The data provide evidence of treatment-associated differential outcomes among breast cancer subtypes.",
  "Severe mental disorders are thought to affect the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer because of their lower awareness and understanding of the disease and their reduced ability to cooperate with medical staff. We analyzed the clinical features of patients with breast cancer and pre-existing mental disorders such as schizophrenia, dementia, and intellectual disability.We reviewed the records of 46 patients who were diagnosed with schizophrenia, dementia, or intellectual disability, before being diagnosed with breast cancer. Three patients had more than 2 mental disorders. All patients underwent curative surgical treatment between September 1992 and January 2015. Patients' clinicopathological information was compared with a control group of 727 breast-cancer patients without mental disorders seen during the same period.Patients with mental disorders were less likely to be aware of their own breast cancer; the lesions were often found by other people such as family, care staff, and medical staff. Breast cancer patients with mental disorders had significantly more advanced T factors and overall stage at the time of surgery than their counterparts without mental illness, more patients underwent total mastectomy, and fewer patients underwent postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation. Biological markers such as estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression were not significantly different between groups. Disease-free survival and overall survival were not significantly different between groups.Patients with mental disorders receive less postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy; however, their outcomes were not worse than those of patients without mental disorders.",
  "There are three main ways in which women can be identified as being at high risk of breast cancer i) family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer, which includes genetic factors ii) mammographically identified high breast density, and iii) certain types of benign breast disease. The last category is the least common, but in some ways the easiest one for which treatment can be offered, because these women have already entered into the treatment system. The highest risk is seen in women with lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), but this is very rare. More common is atypical hyperplasia (AH), which carries a 4-5-fold risk of breast cancer as compared to general population. Even more common is hyperplasia of the usual type and carries a roughly two-fold increased risk. Women with aspirated cysts are also at increased risk of subsequent breast cancer. Tamoxifen has been shown to be particularly effective in preventing subsequent breast cancer in women with AH, with a more than 70% reduction in the P1 trial and a 60% reduction in IBIS-I. The aromatase inhibitors (AIs) also are highly effective for AH and LCIS. There are no published data on the effectiveness of tamoxifen or the AIs for breast cancer prevention in women with hyperplasia of the usual type, or for women with aspirated cysts. Improving diagnostic consistency, breast cancer risk prediction and education of physicians and patients regarding therapeutic prevention in women with benign breast disease may strengthen breast cancer prevention efforts.",
  "Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer morbidity, disability and mortality in women, worldwide. Overall, in 2020, it was the most diagnosed malignancy. Differences in breast cancer mortality have been historically evidenced, as a result of disparities in access to diagnosis, treatment and palliative care. Epidemiologic trends in the last decades display three main patterns of breast cancer mortality: some high-income countries report continuous substantial improvements exceeding 2% annual mortality reduction; however, many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have stagnant or even increasing mortality rates. Population-based studies show that investing in breast cancer control, based on a primary health care approach, and expanding the cancer treatment capacity can portend population health benefits, with positive changes of the epidemiological adverse trajectories. Framed as part of the political commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals Agenda, World Health Organization (WHO) has recently launched a global initiative to tackle disparities in breast cancer mortality. The WHO-led Global Breast Cancer Initiative (GBCI) is framed across 3 pillars, to address key determinants of the cancer-related outcomes: health promotion and early detection, timely access to diagnosis and treatment, comprehensive breast cancer treatment, palliative and survivorship care. GBCI is a systematized approach, with the goal to (i) increase the fraction of newly diagnosed invasive cancers being stage 1 or 2 at diagnosis (60% or more), (ii) ensure diagnostic work-up to be completed within 60\u00a0days from the first connection with the primary healthcare providers to avoid delays in diagnosis and treatment and (iii) assure 80% or more women with breast cancer to undergo and complete multimodal treatments. GBCI will pursue a comprehensive and multisectoral approach, to deliver population health, social and economic benefits, ultimately intended as an entry point for health system strengthening and for the broader cancer control.",
  "There is growing evidence that chemotherapy may have a significant impact on the brains of breast cancer patients, causing changes in cortical morphology. However, early morphological alterations induced by chemotherapy in breast cancer patients are unclear. To investigate the patterns of those alterations, we compared female breast cancer patients (n\u00a0=\u00a045) longitudinally before (time point 0, TP0) and after (time point 1, TP1) the first cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and surface-based morphometry (SBM). VBM and SBM alteration data underwent correlation analysis. We also compared cognition-related neuropsychological tests in the breast cancer patients between TP0 and TP1. Reductions in gray matter volume, cortical thickness, sulcal depth, and gyrification index were found in most brain areas, while increments were found to be mainly concentrated in and around the hippocampus. Reductions of fractal dimension mainly occurred in the limbic and occipital lobes, while increments mainly occurred in the anterior and posterior central gyrus. Significant correlations were found between altered VBM and altered SBM mainly in the bilateral superior frontal gyrus. We found no significant differences in the cognition-related neuropsychological tests before and after chemotherapy. The altered brain regions are in line with those associated with impaired cognitive domains in previous studies. We conclude that breast cancer patients showed widespread morphological alterations soon after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, despite an absence of cognitive impairments. The affected brain regions may indicate major targets of early brain damage after chemotherapy.",
  "Essentials The role of coagulation factor V (encoded by F5) in cancer pathogenesis is unknown. The clinical significance of tumor-expressed F5 was evaluated in breast cancer patient cohorts. F5 was expressed in human breast tumors, and the expression was higher than in normal tissue. High F5 expression was associated with aggressive tumors, but also with survival in breast cancer.Background Tumor expression of certain coagulation factors has been linked to cancer progression. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in F5 (encoding the FV protein) have been found to be associated with breast cancer; however, the role of coagulation factor V (FV) in cancer pathogenesis remains undiscovered. Objectives We aimed to investigate the clinical significance of FV and the regulatory role of F5 gene variants in breast cancer. Patients/Methods A Scandinavian 503-sample breast cancer cohort and three public breast cancer datasets (GOBO, TCGA and KM plotter) were used to determine associations between F5 gene expression (tumor-specific), circulating FV, F5 SNPs, clinical characteristics and breast cancer survival. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect FV antigen in tumors. Results F5 expression was 2-fold higher in breast tumors compared with normal tissue, and the presence of FV antigen in breast tumors was confirmed by IHC staining. F5 expression was increased in patients with hormone receptor negative tumors, triple negative tumors, HER2-enriched and basal-like tumors. In patients with basal tumors, high expression of F5 was associated with improved overall survival (hazard ratio, HR = 0.52, 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.86). SNPs in F5 were associated with tumor size and luminal A tumors. The rs6427202-rs9332542 C-G haplotype, previously associated with breast cancer, displayed a cis-regulatory effect on F5 expression in tumors and plasma FV antigen levels. In silico mining supported this regulatory function. Conclusions FV was a possible marker of aggressive breast cancer, yet also a predictor of favorable outcome. Evaluation of FV expression may be clinically useful for prognosis and treatment decisions in aggressive breast cancer.",
  "Nitric oxide (NO) is a free radical involved in carcinogenesis and is synthesized by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Genetic changes in the eNOS enzyme affect its activity, and the nitric oxide produced by inhibiting apoptosis can lead to cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. In this study, in addition to investigating the relationship between genetic changes in eNOS gene and the risk of breast cancer, the relationship between genotypes of polymorphisms, age, smoking, body mass index, and clinopathologic parameters was also investigated.Three functional (Intron 4a/b, T786C, and G894T) and 1 tagging (G10T) polymorphisms of the eNOS gene were examined in 203 patients with breast cancer and 203 control subjects, and their genotypes were identified by restriction fragment length polymorphism polymerase chain reaction.The T allele in G10T polymorphism increased the risk of breast cancer by 1.503-fold, whereas allele a in Intron 4, T allele in G894T, and C allele in T786C decreased its risk by 0.678-, 0.440-, and 0.525-fold, respectively. GG, GT (G10T), bb and ab (Intron4), GG and TT (G894T), and TT and CC (T786C) genotypes were significantly correlated with body mass index. There was a significant relationship between age and bb genotype, cigarette smoking and genotype ab (Intron 4), and estrogen receptor and GG (G10T) genotype. Tumor invasion factor was also significantly associated with TT (G10T), bb (Intron 4), and TT (T786C) genotypes.Genetic changes in eNOS appear to have a dual role in breast cancer rate owing to changes in NO production and can be introduced as one of the genetic markers involved in breast cancer by evaluating the genotype of different populations.",
  "In establishing the 2018 Breast Cancer Practice Guidelines of the Japan Breast Cancer Society, we explored the optimal first-line endocrine therapy for advanced postmenopausal hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.We performed a systematic review of relevant reports from randomized-controlled studies published prior to November 2016 found using medical journal search engines. The main outcomes which we evaluated were progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (CBR), and toxicity.Four controlled trials comparing aromatase inhibitors (AI) and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4/6 inhibitor combination therapy to AI monotherapy, and two controlled trials comparing anastrozole to fulvestrant 500\u00a0mg were analyzed. AI/CDK4/6 inhibitor combination therapy significantly improved PFS (Risk Ratio: 0.67, 95%CI 0.60-0.73), increased ORR (Risk Difference: 0.11, 95% CI 0.07-0.16), and increased CBR (Risk Difference: 0.11, 95% CI 0.07-0.15), compared with AI monotherapy. Patients who received this combination therapy had a higher grade\u2009\u2265\u20093 adverse event rate more than those who received AI monotherapy (Risk Difference: 43%, 95%CI: 0.39-0.47). Fulvestrant 500\u00a0mg alone significantly improved PFS (risk ratio: 0.85, 95%CI 0.72-0.98), but ORR and CBR were similar to those of anastrozole alone.In the first-line treatment for advanced postmenopausal hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, a combination therapy of CDK4/6 inhibitors and AI showed significant improvement of PFS, ORR, and CBR but with significant increased toxicities compared with AI alone. Fulvestrant 500\u00a0mg monotherapy significantly prolonged PFS compared with AI monotherapy. We must wait for the results of the studies with longer follow-up period.",
  "The endocrine therapy resistance of breast cancer is the difficulty and challenge to be urgently solved in the current treatment. In this study, we examined the effects of noncoding RNA LINC00094 and miR-19a-3p on breast cancer <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> by RT-QPCR, Western Blot, luciferase assay, immunofluorescence and drug sensitivity tests. The plasma level of CYP19A1 in patients with breast cancer resistance was lower than that in drug sensitive patients. Compared with normal subjects, miR-19a-3p was highly expressed in plasma of patients with breast cancer. miR-19a-3p is highly expressed in estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cells. The expression of miR-19a-3p promoted the migration and EMT of breast cancer cells and reduced the sensitivity of breast cancer to Letrozole. LINC00094 sponge adsorbed miR-19a-3p. LINC00094 promotes the expression of CYP19A1, the target gene of miR-19a-3p, and inhibits the EMT process of breast cancer, ultimately promoting the sensitivity of ER-positive breast cancer cells to Letrozole. This study found a new mechanism of Letrozole sensitivity in ER positive breast cancer.",
  "Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) represents a deadly aggressive phenotype of breast cancer (BC) with a unique clinicopathological presentation and low survival rate. In fact, obesity represents an important risk factor for BC. Although several studies have identified different cellular-derived and molecular factors involved in IBC progression, the role of adipocytes remains unclear. Cancer-associated adipose tissue (CAAT) expresses a variety of adipokines, which contribute to tumorigenesis and the regulation of cancer stem cell (CSC). This research investigated the potential effect of the secretome of CAAT explants from patients with BC on the progression and metastasis of the disease.This study established an ex-vivo culture of CAAT excised from IBC (n = 13) vs. non-IBC (n = 31) patients with obesity and profiled their secretome using a cytokine antibody array. Furthermore, the quantitative PCR (qPCR) methodology was used to validate the levels of predominant cytokines at the transcript level after culture in a medium conditioned by CAAT. Moreover, the impact of the CAAT secretome on the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cells with stem cell (CSC) markers was studied in the non-IBC MDA-MB-231 and the IBC SUM-149 cell lines. The statistical differences between variables were evaluated using the chi-squared test and unpaired a Student's t-test.The results of cytokine array profiling revealed an overall significantly higher level of a panel of 28 cytokines secreted by the CAAT ex-vivo culture from IBC patients with obesity compared to those with non-IBC. Of note, interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and monocyte chemo-attractant protein 1 (MCP-1) were the major adipokines secreted by the CAAT IBC patients with obesity. Moreover, the qPCR results indicated a significant upregulation of the IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 mRNAs in CAAT ex-vivo culture of patients with IBC vs. those with non-IBC. Intriguingly, a qPCR data analysis showed that the CAAT secretome secretions from patients with non-IBC downregulated the mRNA levels of the CD24 CSC marker and of the epithelial marker E-cadherin in the non-IBC cell line. By contrast, E-cadherin was upregulated in the SUM-149 cell.This study identified the overexpression of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 as prognostic markers of CAAT from patients with IBC but not from those with non-IBC ; moreover, their upregulation might be associated with IBC aggressiveness via the regulation of CSC and EMT markers. This study proposed that targeting IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 may represent a therapeutic option that should be considered in the treatment of patients with IBC.",
  "Numerous factors influence breast cancer (BC) prognosis, thus complicating the prediction of outcome. By identifying biomarkers that would distinguish the cases with poorer response to therapy already at the time of diagnosis, the rate of survival could be improved. Lately, Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) have been introduced as potential cancer biomarkers, however, due to the recently raised challenges in piRNA annotations, further evaluation of piRNAs' involvement in cancer is required. We performed small RNA sequencing in 227 fresh-frozen breast tissue samples from the Eastern Finnish Kuopio Breast Cancer Project material to study the presence of piRNAs in BC and their associations with the clinicopathological features and outcome of BC patients. We observed the presence of three small RNAs annotated as piRNA database entries (DQ596932, DQ570994, and DQ571955) in our samples. The actual species of these RNAs however remain uncertain. All three small RNAs were upregulated in grade III tumors and DQ596932 additionally in estrogen receptor negative tumors. Furthermore, patients with estrogen receptor positive BC and higher DQ571955 had shorter relapse-free survival and poorer BC-specific survival, thus indicating DQ571955 as a candidate predictive marker for radiotherapy response in estrogen receptor positive BC. DQ596932 showed possible prognostic value in BC, whereas DQ570994 was identified as a candidate predictive marker for tamoxifen and chemotherapy response. These three small RNAs appear as candidate biomarkers for BC, which could after further investigation provide novel approaches for the treatment of therapy resistant BC. Overall, our results indicate that the prevalence of piRNAs in cancer is most likely not as comprehensive as has been previously thought.",
  "National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines currently recommend germline testing for high-risk genes in selected patients with breast cancer. The clinical utility of recommending testing all patients with breast cancer with multigene panels is currently under consideration.To examine the implications of universal testing of patients with breast cancer with respect to clinical decision-making.Patients from a previously reported cohort were assessed as in-criteria or out-of-criteria according to the 2017 guidelines and underwent testing with a multigene germline panel between 2017 to 2018. Patients were women and men aged 18 to 90 years, with a new and/or previous diagnosis of breast cancer who had not undergone either single or multigene testing. Clinicians from 20 community and academic sites documented patient clinical information and changes to clinical recommendations made according to test findings. Association between prevalence of pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants and previously unreported clinical features, including scores generated by the BRCAPRO statistical model, was determined. Data were analyzed from April 2020 to May 2022.New and/or previous diagnosis of breast cancer.Disease management recommendations that were changed as a result of genetic testing results are reported.Clinicians were asked to assess changes to clinical management as a result of germline genetic testing for 952 patients. Informative clinician-reported recommendations were provided for 939 (467 in-criteria and 472 out-of-criteria) of the patients with breast cancer (936 [99.7%] female; 702 [74.8%] White; mean [SD] age at initial diagnosis, 57.6 [11.5] years). One or more changes were reported for 31 of 37 (83.8%) in-criteria patients and 23 of 34 (67.6%) out-of-criteria patients with a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant. Recommendations were changed as a result of testing results for 14 of 22 (63.6%) out-of-criteria patients who had a variant in a breast cancer predisposition gene. Clinicians considered testing beneficial for two-thirds of patients with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants and for one-third of patients with either negative results or variants of uncertain significance. There was no difference in variant rate between patients meeting the BRCAPRO threshold (\u226510%) and those who did not (P\u2009=\u2009.86, Fisher exact test). No changes to clinical recommendations were made for most patients with negative results (345 of 349 patients [98.9%]) or variants of uncertain significance (492 of 509 patients [96.7%]).In this cohort study, germline genetic testing was used by clinicians to direct treatment for most out-of-criteria patients with breast cancer with pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants, including those with moderate-risk variants. Universal germline testing informs clinical decision-making and provides access to targeted treatments and clinical trials for all patients with breast cancer.",
  "Male breast cancer is a rare malignant disease, accounting for <1% of all breast cancers. The treatment of male breast cancer is mainly extrapolated from the enormous literature and clinical experience in women. The objective of the current study was to assess the relationship between adjuvant chemotherapy and survival in a large population-based cohort of patients with early-stage male breast cancer.Men with invasive stage I to stage III breast cancer were identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer database from 1990 to 2014. The effect of chemotherapy on survival was determined using multivariable Cox regression.Of 2713 male patients enrolled, 1817 (66.9%) did not receive chemotherapy. Age, T classification, N classification, tumor grade, and progesterone receptor (PR) status were found to be strong predictors of chemotherapy administration. Chemotherapy was associated with a significant 26% reduction in all-cause mortality (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and a marginally significant 21% reduction in breast cancer-specific mortality (P\u00a0=\u00a0.085). For men with PR-negative breast cancer, use of chemotherapy was associated with improved breast cancer-specific survival (hazards ratio [HR], 0.50; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.28-0.91 [P\u00a0=\u00a0.023]) and overall survival (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.37-0.77 [P\u00a0=\u00a0.001]). However, chemotherapy did not improve the breast cancer-specific survival for all men with PR-positive tumors (P\u00a0=\u00a0.959); it was associated with improved overall survival (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66-0.92 [P\u00a0=\u00a0.004]) for men with PR-positive stage II and stage III breast cancer.Chemotherapy should be considered for men with PR-negative, nonmetastatic breast cancer and PR-positive, stage II and stage III breast cancer.",
  "Using a machine learning method, this study aimed to identify unique causal networks of genes associated with bone, brain, and lung metastasis of breast cancer. Bayesian network analysis identified differentially expressed genes in primary breast cancer tissues, in bone, brain, and lung breast cancer metastatic tissues, and the clinicopathological features of patients obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus microarray datasets. We evaluated the causal Bayesian networks of breast metastasis to distant sites (bone, brain, or lung) by (i) measuring how well the structures of each specific type of breast cancer metastasis fit the data, (ii) comparing the structures with known experimental evidence, and (iii) reporting predictive capabilities of the structures. We report for the first time that the molecular gene signatures are specific to the different types of breast cancer metastasis. Several genes, including CHPF, ARC, ANGPTL4, NR2E1, SH2D1A, CTSW, POLR2J4, SPTLC1, ILK, ALDH3B1, PDE6A, SCTR, ADM, HEY1, KCNF1, and UVRAG, were found to be predictors of the risk for site-specific metastasis of breast cancer. Expression of POLR2JA, SPTLC1, ILK, ALDH3B1, and the estrogen receptor was significantly associated with breast cancer bone metastasis. Expression of PDE6A and NR2E1 was causally linked to breast cancer brain metastasis. Expression of HEY1, KCNF1, UVRAG, and the estrogen and progesterone receptors was strongly associated with breast cancer lung metastasis. The causal Bayesian network structures of these genes identify potential interactions among the genes in distant metastases of breast cancer, including to the bone, brain, and lung, and may serve as target candidates for treatment of breast cancer metastasis.",
  "Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women and almost all of the breast cancer-caused mortality is related to metastasis. It has been reported that glucocorticoid facilitates the metastasis of breast cancer in mice, and mifepristone can antagonize the effect of glucocorticoid. Paclitaxel is one of the important drugs in the treatment of breast cancer. Mifepristone combined with paclitaxel could be an effective strategy for inhibiting breast cancer metastasis. However, their inherent defects, in terms of short blood circulation half-life and lack of tumor targeting, not only limit their effectiveness but also cause adverse reactions. Therefore, our aim is to explore a novel protocol against breast cancer metastasis, further optimize its therapeutic efficacy by a nanodelivery system, and explore its mechanism. Herein, a paclitaxel-conjugated and mifepristone-loaded hydrogel (PM-nano) was prepared by self-assembly. Its characterizations were studied. The antimetastatic effect was evaluated in vitro and in vivo and its mechanism was also explored by western blot assay. The resultant PM-nano was developed with favorable water solubility and good biocompatibility. Moreover, PM-nano displayed increased cell uptake properties and stimulated drug release in the tumor micro-acidic environment. The PM-nano was more effective in inhibiting the proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer than other groups in vitro and in vivo. The PM-nano might inhibit metastasis through glucocorticoid receptor/receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 and MMPs. Taken together, PM-nano showed superior antimetastatic effects against breast cancer and excellent biocompatibility in vitro and in vivo, providing a new option for limiting metastasis.",
  "Black women are more likely than non-Hispanic White women to be diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive subtype with limited treatment options. The study objective was to evaluate the associations of known breast cancer risk factors, including breast density, with TNBC among Black women.This study included Black women who underwent screening mammography between the ages of 40-84\u00a0years at a University of Pennsylvania Health System between 2010 and 2015. Cox proportional hazard models using multiple imputation with chained equations were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for risk factors for ER/PR+/HER2-\u2009and TNBC.Among 25,013 Black women, there were 330 incident breast cancers (1.3%) during a mean follow-up of 5.8\u00a0years; 218 (66.1%) ER/PR+\u2009HER-\u2009and 61 (18.1%) TNBC. Having dense breasts (heterogeneously dense or extremely dense) vs. non-dense breasts (almost entirely fatty or scattered areas of fibroglandular density) increased risk of ER/PR+/HER2-\u2009breast cancer almost 80% (HR 1.79, 95% CI 1.32-2.43) and TNBC more than twofold (HR 2.53, 1.45-4.44). Older age was associated with an increased risk for ER/PR+/HER2-\u2009(HR 1.04, 1.03-1.06) and TNBC (HR 1.03, 1.00-1.05). Having a BMI of\u2009>\u200930\u00a0kg/m<sup>2</sup> was associated with an increased risk (HR 2.77, 1.05-7.30) for TNBC and an increased risk of ERPR+/HER2-\u2009breast cancer in postmenopausal but not pre-menopausal women (p-interaction\u2009=\u20090.016).Our results suggest that breast density and obesity are strong risk factors for TNBC among Black women. Understanding breast cancer subtype specific risk factors among Black women can help improve risk assessment.",
  "In 1971, Sir Alexander Haddow et al. delivered the inaugural David A. Karnofsky lecture at the American Society for Clinical Oncology. This award was designated American Society for Clinical Oncology's highest, as he had used translational research to identify the first clinical therapy, that is, synthetic estrogens to treat breast cancer. His lecture was entitled \"Thoughts on Chemical Therapy.\" For 40 years, high-dose synthetic estrogens were used as palliative therapy, for some advanced breast cancer patients 5 years following menopause. Mechanisms were unknown. Tamoxifen, a failed \"morning-after pill,\" is an antiestrogen in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, which was subsequently used to treat all stages of breast cancer and to prevent breast cancer. In 2008, Jordan was selected to present the 38th Karnofsky lecture entitled: \"The Paradoxical Action of Estrogen in Breast Cancer-Survival or Death?\" Unexpectedly, through a study of acquired resistance to long-term tamoxifen therapy, estrogen-induced apoptosis in long-term estrogen-deprived breast cancer was deciphered in Jordan's laboratory. These data and the biological rules established under laboratory conditions provided molecular mechanisms to aid in the interpretation of the Women's Health initiative in the United States and the Million Women Study in the United Kingdom. In addition, by establishing laboratory models to understand mechanisms of estrogen-induced apoptosis, new estrogen derivatives were successfully evaluated in the laboratory and tested as candidates for women after the therapeutic failure of antiestrogenic strategies to treat breast cancer. For the future, the knowledge obtained about estrogen-induced apoptosis in cancer holds the promise of discovering new therapies to control or cure cancer in general.",
  "Considerable efforts have been devoted to exploring the breast cancer mutational landscape to understand its genetic complexity. However, no studies have yet comprehensively elucidated the molecular characterization of breast tumors in Chinese women. This study aimed to determine the potential clinical utility of peripheral blood assessment for circulating tumor-derived DNA (ctDNA) and comprehensively characterize the female Chinese population's genetic mutational spectrum. We used Omi-Seq to create cancer profiles of 273 patients enrolled at The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. The gene landscape results indicate <i>PIK3CA</i> and <i>TP53</i> as the most frequently detected genes, followed by <i>ERBB2,</i> in Chinese breast cancer patients. The accuracy of <i>ERBB2</i> copy number variations in tissue/formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples was 95% with 86% sensitivity and 99% specificity. Moreover, mutation numbers varied between different molecular cell-free DNA subtypes, with the basal-like patients harboring a higher number of variants than the luminal patients. Furthermore, ratio changes in the max ctDNA allele fraction highly correlated with clinical response measurements, including cancer relapse and metastasis. Our data demonstrate that ctDNA characterization using the Omi-Seq platform can extend the capacity of personalized clinical cancer management.",
  "<b>Objective:</b> To develop a predictive model for pathologic complete response (pCR) of ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph nodes (ISLN) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer and guide the local treatment. <b>Methods:</b> Two hundred and eleven consecutive breast cancer patients with first diagnosis of ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node metastasis who underwent ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node dissection and treated in the Breast Department of Henan Cancer Hospital from September 2012 to May 2019 were included. One hundred and forty two cases were divided into the training set while other 69 cases into the validation set. The factors affecting ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node pCR (ispCR)of breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, and a nomogram prediction model of ispCR was established. Internal and external validation evaluation of the nomogram prediction model were conducted by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and plotting calibration curves. <b>Results:</b> Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that Ki-67 index, number of axillary lymph node metastases, breast pCR, axillary pCR, and ISLN size after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were associated with ispCR of breast cancerafter neoadjuvant chemotherapy (<i>P</i><0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the number of axillary lymph node metastases (<i>OR</i>=5.035, 95%<i>CI:</i> 1.722-14.721, <i>P</i>=0.003), breast pCR (<i>OR</i>=4.662, 95%<i>CI:</i> 1.456-14.922, <i>P</i>=0.010) and ISLN size after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (<i>OR</i>=4.231, 95%<i>CI:</i> 1.194-14.985, <i>P</i>=0.025) were independent predictors of ispCR of breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. A nomogram prediction model of ispCR of breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy was constructed using five factors: number of axillary lymph node metastases, Ki-67 index, breast pCR, axillary pCR and size of ISLN after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The areas under the ROC curve for the nomogram prediction model in the training and validation sets were 0.855 and 0.838, respectively, and the difference was not statistically significant (<i>P</i>=0.755). The 3-year disease-free survival rates of patients in the ispCR and non-ispCR groups after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were 64.3% and 54.8%, respectively, with statistically significant differences (<i>P</i>=0.024), the 3-year overall survival rates were 83.8% and 70.2%, respectively, without statistically significant difference (<i>P</i>=0.087). <b>Conclusions:</b> Disease free survival is significantly improved in breast cancer patients with ispCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The constructed nomogram prediction model of ispCR of breast cancer patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is well fitted. Application of this prediction model can assist the development of local management strategies for the ipsilateral supraclavicular region after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and predict the long-term prognosis of breast cancer patients.",
  "The chemokine Cxcl10 has been associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer, but the mechanism is not well understood. Our previous study has shown that <i>CXCL10</i> was repressed by the ING4 tumor suppressor, suggesting a potential inverse functional relationship. We thus investigated a role for Cxcl10 in the context of ING4 deficiencies in breast cancer. We first analyzed public gene expression data sets and found that patients with <i>CXCL10</i>-high/<i>ING4</i>-low expressing tumors had significantly reduced disease-free survival in breast cancer. <i>In vitro</i>, Cxcl10 induced migration of <i>ING4</i>-deleted breast cancer cells but not of <i>ING4</i>-intact cells. Using inhibitors, we found that Cxcl10-induced migration of <i>ING4</i>-deleted cells required Cxcr3, Egfr, and the G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits downstream of Cxcr3 but not G\u03b1i. Immunofluorescent imaging showed that Cxcl10 induced early transient colocalization between Cxcr3 and Egfr in both <i>ING4</i>-intact and <i>ING4</i>-deleted cells, which recurred only in <i>ING4</i>-deleted cells. A peptide agent that binds to the internal juxtamembrane domain of Egfr inhibited Cxcr3/Egfr colocalization and cell migration. Taken together, these results presented a novel mechanism of Cxcl10 that elicits migration of <i>ING4</i>-deleted cells, in part by inducing a physical or proximal association between Cxcr3 and Egfr and signaling downstream via G\u03b2\u03b3. These results further indicated that ING4 plays a critical role in the regulation of Cxcl10 signaling that enables breast cancer progression.",
  "Metaplastic breast cancer (MpBC) is an exceedingly rare breast cancer variant that is therapeutically challenging and aggressive. MpBC is defined by the histological presence of at least two cellular types, typically epithelial and mesenchymal components. This variant harbors a triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) phenotype, yet has a worse prognosis and decreased survival compared to TNBC. There are currently no standardized treatment guidelines specifically for MpBC. However, prior studies have found that MpBC typically has molecular alterations in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, amplification of epidermal growth factor receptor, PI3K/Akt signaling, nitric oxide signaling, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, altered immune response, and cell cycle dysregulation. Some of these molecular alterations have been studied as therapeutic targets, in both the preclinical and clinical setting. This current review discusses the histological organization and cellular origins of MpBC, molecular alterations, the role of radiation therapy, and current clinical trials for MpBC.",
  "Patients with low-risk invasive ductal carcinoma treated with breast-conserving surgery (BCS) were included in a multicatheter brachytherapy APBI protocol. The primary endpoint was ipsilateral breast recurrence. Between December 2008-December 2017, 186 low-risk breast cancer patients were treated with APBI using interstitial multicatheter brachytherapy and followed prospectively. At 5-years of follow-up, cumulative local recurrence (LR) and cause-specific survival was 1.1% (95% CI 0.3-1.9) and 98.3% (95% CI 97.3-99.3%) respectively. No grade 3 adverse effects were observed. Postoperative APBI using multicatheter brachytherapy after BCS in early breast cancer patients have excellent rates of local control and survival, without significant toxicity.",
  "Breast cancer growth is generally expected to differ between tumor subtypes. We aimed to evaluate tumor doubling time (DT) using ultrasonography and verify whether each tumor subtype has a unique DT.This retrospective study included 265 patients with invasive breast cancer who received serial ultrasonography between diagnosis and surgery. Tumor diameters were measured in three directions and DTs were calculated according to an exponential growth model using the volume change during serial ultrasonography. We investigated the relationships between DT, tumor subtype, and histopathological factors.Volumes did not change in 95 (36%) of 265 tumors and increased in 170 (64%) tumors during serial ultrasonography (mean interval, 56.9 days). The mean volume increases of all tumors and volume-increased tumors were 22.1% and 34.5%, respectively. Triple-negative tumors had greater volume increases (40% vs. 20%, p\u2009=\u20090.001) and shorter DT (124 vs. 185 days, p\u2009=\u20090.027) than estrogen receptor (ER)+/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)- tumors. Volume-increased tumors had higher Ki-67 indices than those of volume-stable tumors in ER+/HER2- (p\u2009=\u20090.002) and ER+/HER2+\u2009tumors (p\u2009=\u20090.011) and higher histological grades in all tumors except triple-negative tumors (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Triple-negative tumors with DTs\u2009<\u200990 days (short-DT) showed higher Ki-67 indices than those with DTs\u2009>\u200990 days (long-DT) (p\u2009=\u20090.008). In ER+/HER2- tumors, histological grades were higher for short-DT than for long-DT tumors (p\u2009=\u20090.022).Differences in tumor DT depending on breast cancer subtype, Ki-67 index, and histological grade were confirmed using serial ultrasonography even during preoperative short interval.",
  "The association between high mammographic density (MD) and elevated breast cancer risk is well established. However, the role of absolute non-dense area remains unclear. We estimated the effect of the mammographic non-dense area and other density parameters on the risk of breast cancer.This study utilizes data from a population-based case-control study conducted in Greater Vancouver, British Columbia, with 477 female postmenopausal breast cancer cases and 588 female postmenopausal controls. MD measures were determined from digitized screening mammograms using computer-assisted software (Cumulus). Marginal odds ratios were estimated by inverse-probability weighting using a causal diagram for confounder selection. Akaike information criteria and receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess the goodness of fit and predictive power of unconditional logistic models containing MD parameters.The risk of breast cancer is 60% lower for the highest quartile compared to the lowest quartile of mammographic non-dense area (marginal OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.26-0.61, p-trend\u2009<\u20090.001). The cancer risk almost doubles for the highest quartile compared to the lowest quartile of dense area (marginal OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.19-2.43, p-trend\u2009<\u20090.001). For the highest quartile of percent density, breast cancer risk was more than three times higher than for the lowest quartile (marginal OR 3.15, 95% CI 1.90-4.40, p-trend\u2009<\u20090.001). No difference was seen in predictive accuracy between models using percent density alone, dense area alone, or non-dense area plus dense area.In this study, non-dense area is an independent risk factor after adjustment for dense area and other covariates, inversely related with the risk of breast cancer. However, non-dense area does not improve prediction over that offered by percent density or dense area alone.",
  "<b>Aim:</b> This study aimed to explore the mechanism of lncRNA <i>PCAT7</i> underlying the progression of breast cancer, which will provide a basis for accurate diagnosis and targeted treatment. <b>Methods:</b> Data from\u00a0The Cancer Genome Atlas\u00a0data associated with breast cancer were used to identify the target lncRNA. <i>In vitro</i> experiments were conducted to detect gene expression and the effect of the lncRNA on cancer cell activities. <b>Results:</b> <i>PCAT7</i> was found to be highly expressed in breast cancer tissue and cells, which activated the\u00a0ErbB/PI3K/Akt pathway to potentiate cancer cell proliferation, migration and\u00a0invasion and suppress apoptosis. <b>Conclusion:</b> <i>PCAT7</i> is likely to promote tumor cell activities by activating ErbB/PI3K/Akt pathway, in turn potentiating tumor malignant progression.",
  "Tumors can acquire tolerance to tumor immunity and develop enhanced proliferation. Regulatory B cells (Bregs), whose role in immune tolerance is similar to that of regulatory T cells (Tregs), appear to be involved in tumor immunity. Recently, Bregs were found to induce Tregs against tumor immunity. However, the platform for the coexistence of Bregs and Tregs in cancer patients and its clinical significance remain unclear; thus, they were evaluated in breast cancer patients.In 489 breast cancer patients, CD25- and IL10-positive Bregs and Foxp3-positive Tregs were immunohistochemically evaluated in tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte aggregates (TIL aggregates) that consisted of CD19-positive B-cell follicles and CD3-positive T-cell parafollicles. Then the correlations of the localization and existence of these cells with metastasis-free survival (MFS) were evaluated in breast cancer patients.TIL aggregates were observed in marginal regions of tumors in breast cancer patients. In the TIL aggregates, the existence of Bregs was closely related to that of Tregs (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). On multivariate analysis, the coexistence of Bregs and Tregs in TIL aggregates was correlated with MFS in breast cancer patients (p\u2009=\u20090.007). Furthermore, MFS was significantly shorter for patients with the coexistence of Tregs and Bregs in TIL aggregates than in those with Tregs alone without Bregs (p\u2009=\u20090.0475).The present results suggest that Bregs are related to the induction of Tregs in TIL aggregates and the development of metastasis of breast cancer cells. Bregs are expected to be a new diagnostic and therapeutic target in breast cancer patients.",
  "Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling plays a critical role in the progression of breast cancer. However, a small part of tumor cells survived from the killing effect of JAK2 inhibitor. We aimed to find out the mechanism of drug resistance in breast cancer cells and develop new therapeutic strategies.The anti-tumor effect of TG101209 in breast cancer cells was confirmed by cell counting kit 8 and flow cytometry. Western blotting was used to determine the up-regulation of zinc finger SWIM-type containing 4 (ZSWIM4) induced by TG101209. In vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to evaluate the role of ZSWIM4 in the resistance of breast cancer cells to TG101209. Through the determination and analysis of 50% inhibiting concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) curves, the effect of combination therapy was confirmed.Our data indicate that the elevated expression of ZSWIM4 contributes to JAK2 inhibition resistance, as knockdown of ZSWIM4 significantly enhances the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to TG101209 and over-expression of this gene mitigates the killing effect. Furthermore, the expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR) and utilization of 1\u03b1,25-(OH)2VD3 is decreased in ZSWIM4-knockdown breast cancer cells. VDR-silencing or GW0742-mediated blockade of VDR activity can partially reverse the JAK2 inhibition resistance.Our data implicated that ZSWIM4 might be an inducible resistance gene of JAK2 inhibition in breast cancer cells. The combination of JAK2 inhibitor and VDR inhibitor may achieve better coordinated therapeutic effect in breast cancer.",
  "Treatment protocols for invasive lobular breast cancer (ILC) have largely followed those for invasive ductal breast cancer. This study compares treatment outcomes of endocrine therapy versus combined chemo-endocrine therapy in hormone-receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-positive (HER2+) ILC tumors in a large national registry.We sampled the National Cancer Database (2010-2016) for female patients with stages I-III, HR+/HER2+ ILC who underwent surgery. Cochran-Armitage trend test examined trends of treatment regimen administration: Surgery only (S), chemotherapy (C), endocrine therapy (ET), and combined chemo-endocrine therapy (CET), with or without anti-HER2 therapy. Cox proportional hazard model were used to compare overall survival (OS) across ET and CET cohorts, stratifying for anti-HER2 therapy, before and after propensity score match of cohorts (2013-2016). Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves were also produced.N=11,421 were included. 58.7% of patients received Anti-Her2 therapy after 2013. CET conferred better OS over ET in the unmatched (adjusted-5-year-OS: 92.5% vs. 81.1%, p<0.001) and PS-matched (90.4% vs. 84.5%, p=0.001) samples. ET caused lower OS in patients who received Anti-Her2 therapy (HR: 2.56, 95% CI: 1.60-4.12, p<0.001) and patients who did not (HR: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.21-2.78, p=0.004), as compared to CET on multivariable analysis. KM modeling showed highest OS in the CET cohort who received Anti-Her2 (93.0%), followed by the CET cohort who did not receive Anti-Her2 (90.2%) (p=0.06).Chemotherapy followed by endocrine therapy and Anti-Her2 therapy was shown to be the most effective treatment modality in HR+/HER2+ ILC, contrasting previous data on the inconclusive benefit of chemotherapy in patients with ILC.",
  "Breast cancer is the most frequent cause of cancer\u2011related mortality among women worldwide. The present study aimed to explore the role of magnesium transporter protein\u00a01 (MAGT1) in breast cancer and to illustrate the potential underlying molecular mechanisms. Bioinformatic analysis was performed to explore the association between MAGT1 expression and patients with breast cancer. MTT, colony formation, wound healing and Transwell assays were performed to examine the proliferative, migratory and invasive abilities of MCF\u20117 cells. Western blot analysis was conducted to determine the corresponding protein expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays were carried out to reveal the interaction between MAGT1 and the Kruppel\u2011like factor\u00a016 (KLF16). In addition, an experimental animal model was established by the subcutaneous injection of MCF\u20117 cells into BALB/c nude mice, and tumor weight and size were measured. The results revealed that MAGT1 expression was upregulated in breast cancer. MAGT1 knockdown significantly suppressed the MCF\u20117 cell proliferative, migratory and invasive abilities, and downregulated the protein expression of Ki67, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, MMP2 and MMP9. MAGT1 knockdown also markedly suppressed tumor growth <i>in\u00a0vivo</i>. Moreover, KLF6 could bind to the MAGT1 promoter and positively regulate MAGT1 expression. The inhibitory effects of KLF6 knockdown on cell proliferation, migration and invasion <i>in\u00a0vitro</i>, and tumor growth <i>in\u00a0vivo</i> were partly abolished by MAGT1 overexpression. On the whole, the findings of the present study suggest that MAGT1 knockdown exerts notable inhibitory effects on the progression of breast cancer, providing a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of breast cancer.",
  "To examine the association between statin use and risk of breast cancer recurrence in a national Danish cohort of postmenopausal breast cancer patients receiving aromatase inhibitors (AI) in the adjuvant setting.We enrolled all postmenopausal patients diagnosed with stage I-III estrogen receptor positive breast cancer during the years 2007-2017, assigned adjuvant AI treatment, and registered in both the Danish Breast Cancer Group database and the Danish Cancer Registry. We ascertained incident statin exposure (\u2265\u20091 prescription post-diagnosis) from the Danish National Prescription Registry and modeled statins as a time-varying exposure lagged by 6 months. Follow-up began 7 months after diagnosis and continued to the first event of recurrence, death, emigration, 5 years elapsed, or 25th September 2018. We estimated incidence rates of recurrence at 5 years and used Cox regression models to compute crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), comparing statin exposure with non-exposure.We enrolled 14,773 eligible patients. During the 5 years of follow-up, there were 32 recurrences in 3163 person-years of follow-up among statin-exposed patients, and 612 recurrences in 45,655 person-years among unexposed patients (incidence rate per 1000 person-years: 10.12 [95% CI 6.92-14.28] and 13.40 [95% CI 12.36-14.51], respectively). In multivariable models, any statin exposure was associated with a reduced rate of 5-year breast cancer recurrence (adjusted HR 0.72 [95% CI 0.50-1.04]). Considering only lipophilic statins as exposure the results were similar (adjusted HR 0.70 [95% CI 0.48-1.02]).Statin use was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer recurrence among postmenopausal patients diagnosed with early stage breast cancer who received adjuvant AI therapy.",
  "Currently, over half of breast cancer cases are unrelated to known risk factors, highlighting the importance of discovering other cancer-promoting factors. Since crosstalk between gut microbes and host immunity contributes to many diseases, we hypothesized that similar interactions could occur between the recently described breast microbiome and local immune responses to influence breast cancer pathogenesis.Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we characterized the microbiome of human breast tissue in a total of 221 patients with breast cancer, 18 individuals predisposed to breast cancer, and 69 controls. We performed bioinformatic analyses using a DADA2-based pipeline and applied linear models with White's t or Kruskal-Wallis H-tests with Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction to identify taxonomic groups associated with prognostic clinicopathologic features. We then used network analysis based on Spearman coefficients to correlate specific bacterial taxa with immunological data from NanoString gene expression and 65-plex cytokine assays.Multiple bacterial genera exhibited significant differences in relative abundance when stratifying by breast tissue type (tumor, tumor adjacent normal, high-risk, healthy control), cancer stage, grade, histologic subtype, receptor status, lymphovascular invasion, or node-positive status, even after adjusting for confounding variables. Microbiome-immune networks within the breast tended to be bacteria-centric, with sparse structure in tumors and more interconnected structure in benign tissues. Notably, Anaerococcus, Caulobacter, and Streptococcus, which were major bacterial hubs in benign tissue networks, were absent from cancer-associated tissue networks. In addition, Propionibacterium and Staphylococcus, which were depleted in tumors, showed negative associations with oncogenic immune features; Streptococcus and Propionibacterium also correlated positively with T-cell activation-related genes.This study, the largest to date comparing healthy versus cancer-associated breast microbiomes using fresh-frozen surgical specimens and immune correlates, provides insight into microbial profiles that correspond with prognostic clinicopathologic features in breast cancer. It additionally presents evidence for local microbial-immune interplay in breast cancer that merits further investigation and has preventative, diagnostic, and therapeutic potential.",
  "Excess body fat and sedentary behavior are associated with increased breast cancer risk and mortality, including in normal weight women. To investigate underlying mechanisms, we examined whether adiposity and exercise impact the breast microenvironment (e.g., inflammation and aromatase expression) and circulating metabo-inflammatory factors. In a cross-sectional cohort study, breast white adipose tissue (WAT) and blood were collected from 100 women undergoing mastectomy for breast cancer risk reduction or treatment. Self-reported exercise behavior, body composition measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and waist:hip ratio were obtained prior to surgery. Breast WAT inflammation (B-WATi) was assessed by IHC and aromatase expression was assessed by quantitative PCR. Metabolic and inflammatory blood biomarkers that are predictive of breast cancer risk and progression were measured. B-WATi was present in 56 of 100 patients and was associated with older age, elevated BMI, postmenopausal status, decreased exercise, hypertension and dyslipidemia (<i>P</i>s < 0.001). Total body fat and trunk fat correlated with B-WATi and breast aromatase levels (<i>P</i>s < 0.001). Circulating C-reactive protein, IL6, insulin, and leptin positively correlated with body fat and breast aromatase levels, while negative correlations were observed for adiponectin and sex hormone binding globulin (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Inverse relationships were observed with exercise (<i>P</i>s < 0.05). In a subgroup of 39 women with normal BMI, body fat levels positively correlated with B-WATi and aromatase expression (<i>P</i>s < 0.05). In conclusion, elevated body fat levels and decreased exercise are associated with protumorigenic micro- and host environments in normal, overweight, and obese individuals. These findings support the development of BMI-agnostic lifestyle interventions that target adiposity. PREVENTION RELEVANCE: We report that individuals with high body fat and low exercise levels have breast inflammation, higher breast aromatase expression, and levels of circulating metabo-inflammatory factors that have been associated with increased breast cancer risk. These findings support interventions to lower adiposity, even among normal weight individuals, to prevent tumor growth.",
  "To explore the effect of age on the prognosis of patients with early stage breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and to provide references for young patients.All clinical data of patients with early breast cancer undergoing BCS who were treated at Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University from January 2011 to May 2016 were obtained. The primary endpoints were local recurrence (LR) and distant recurrence, and the secondary endpoint was breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS). Chi-squared tests and Fisher's exact tests were used for statistical analysis. Disease-free survival (DFS) and BCSS were calculated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and compared using log-rank tests. Logistic regression was used for multivariable analysis of the effect of age in different subgroups. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to reduce the bias confounding factors on oncological outcomes.Younger patients had higher Ki-67 expression (<i>P</i>=0.048) and larger tumors (<i>P</i>=0.042) compared to older patients. No other clinical features were significantly different between age groups. There was no significant difference between the two groups in BCSS (<i>P</i>=0.186); however, DFS was significantly different before PSM (<i>P</i>=0.012). Triple-negative breast cancer and Ki-67 positivity combined with younger age at diagnosis were associated with a higher risk of recurrence (<i>P</i>=0.018 and <i>P</i>=0.046, respectively). After PSM, there were no significant differences in BCSS nor DFS between the two age groups (<i>P</i>=0.559 and <i>P</i>=0.261, respectively).BCS for young patients is not associated with increased DFS nor BCSS. However, young patients with triple-negative breast cancer and/or Ki-67 positivity have a poor prognosis. In sum, BCS may be appropriate for a subgroup of young patients.",
  "Lymphovenous anastomosis (LVA) is primarily used for treating early-stage lymphedema. Here, we aimed to investigate the relationship between lymphatic flow velocity and the efficacy of LVA in breast cancer-related lymphedema patients. To this end, we assessed the transit velocity of lymphatic fluid using indocyanine green (ICG) lymphography and radioisotope lymphoscintigraphy.We retrospectively examined patients diagnosed with breast cancer-related lymphedema who underwent LVA from January to December 2020. Patient data, including demographics, clinical stage, and postoperative surgical outcomes, were collected from electronic medical records. ICG lymphography results and dynamic lymphoscintigrams were analyzed to measure the lymphatic flow velocity and to determine the grade of the limb lymphedemas.Eighty patients (all female, mean age of 53.6\u00a0years) were included. The lymphatic flow velocity ranged between 0.58 and 21.5\u00a0cm/min (average, 7.61\u00a0cm/min); 37 (46.3%), 18 (22.5%), 15 (18.8%), and 10 (12.5%) arm lymphedemas were classified as lymphoscintigraphy grade 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. A significant association was observed between lymphatic flow velocity and lymphedema grade determined using lymphoscintigraphy and between the amount of volume reduction after LVA and preoperative lymphatic flow velocity (P\u2009<\u20090.05).Our findings suggest that lymphatic flow velocity is positively correlated with surgical outcomes in patients undergoing LVA. Therefore, surgical treatment plans for lymphedema should not be based only on the International Society of Lymphedema stage, because advanced-stage lymphedema patients with high ICG velocities can benefit from LVA alone.",
  "Breast cancer accounts for 25% of the cancers in women worldwide. The most common subtype of breast cancer diagnosed is hormone receptor positive, which expresses the oestrogen receptor (ER). Targeting of the ER with endocrine therapy (ET) is the current standard of care for ER-positive (ER+) breast cancer, reducing the mortality by up to 40%. Resistance to ET, however, remains a major issue for ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancer, leading to recurrence and metastasis. One major driver of ET resistance is mutations in the ER gene (ESR1) leading to constitutive transcriptional activity and reduced ET sensitivity. These mutations are particularly detrimental in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) as they are present in as high as 36% of the patients. This review summarises the pre-clinical characterisation of ESR1 mutations and their association with clinical outcomes in MBC and primary disease. The clinically approved and investigational therapeutic options for ESR1 mutant breast cancer and the current clinical trials evaluating ESR1 mutations and ET resistance are also discussed. Finally, this review addresses pre-clinical models and multi-'omics' approaches for developing the next generation of therapeutics for ESR1 mutant and ET-resistant breast cancer.",
  "Pseudopodium-enriched atypical kinase 1 (PEAK1) has been reported to be upregulated in human malignancies and is correlated with a poor prognosis. Enhanced PEAK1 expression facilitates tumor cell survival, invasion, metastasis and chemoresistance. However, the role of PEAK1 in breast cancer is unclear. We investigated PEAK1 expression in breast cancer and analyzed the relationship with clinicopathological status and chemotherapy resistance. We also investigated the role of PEAK1 in breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Immunohistochemistry for PEAK1 was performed in 112 surgically resected breast cancer tissues. The association between clinicopathological status, chemotherapy resistance and PEAK1 expression was determined. The effect of PEAK1 overexpression or downregulation on proliferation, colony formation, invasion, migration, metastasis and doxorubicin sensitivity in MCF-7 cells in vitro and in vivo was studied. PEAK1 was overexpressed in breast cancer tissues. High PEAK1 expression was correlated with tumor size, high tumor grade, tumor stage, lymph node metastasis, recurrence, Ki-67 expression, Her-2 expression and chemotherapy resistance. Inhibiting PEAK1 decreased cell growth, invasion, metastasis and reversed chemoresistance to doxorubicin in breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. High PEAK1 expression was associated with the invasion, metastasis and chemoresistance of breast cancers. Furthermore, targeting PEAK1 inhibited cell growth and metastasis and reversed chemoresistance in breast cancer cells. Targeting PEAK1 could be an effective treatment strategy for breast cancer.",
  "Tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are of important prognostic and predictive value in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer (BC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), but their clinical relevance in oestrogen receptor-positive/HER2-negative (ER+/HER2-) remains unknown. The primary study aim was to analyse the prognostic effect of TILs on the BC-free interval (BCFi) in premenopausal patients stratified by BC subtypes. The secondary aim was to investigate if TILs are predictive of tamoxifen (TAM) benefit.Archival tissues from primary breast tumours were collected from patients from the SBII:2pre trial, in which 564 premenopausal women were randomised to 2\u2009years of adjuvant TAM or no systemic treatment, regardless of hormone receptor status. TILs were scored on whole tissue sections from 447 patients with available ER status. Tumours were divided into ER+/HER2-, HER2+ and TNBC subtypes by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridisation. The prognostic value of TILs was analysed in systemically untreated patients (n\u2009=\u2009221); the predictive information was investigated in the ER+ subgroup (n\u2009=\u2009321) by cumulative incidence curves and Cox regression analyses. The median follow-up was 28\u2009years.High (\u2265\u200950%) infiltration of TILs was a favourable prognostic factor in terms of BCFi (univariable analysis: hazard ratio<sub>BCFi</sub> (HR<sub>BCFi</sub>) 0.40; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22-0.71; P\u2009=\u20090.002). Similar effects were observed across all BC subtypes. The effect of adjuvant TAM was stronger in patients with ER+ tumours and TILs <\u200950% (HR<sub>BCFi</sub> 0.63; 95% CI 0.47-0.84; P\u2009=\u20090.002) than in patients with high immune infiltration (\u2265\u200950%) (HR<sub>BCFi</sub> 0.84; 95% CI (0.24-2.86); P\u2009=\u20090.77). However, evidence for differential effects of TAM in categories of TILs, i.e. interaction, was weak.We demonstrate a long-term favourable prognostic value of high infiltration of TILs in a cohort of premenopausal BC patients and the positive prognostic effect was extended to the ER+/HER2- subgroup. A beneficial effect of TAM in ER+ patients was observed in patients with tumours of low TIL infiltration, but evidence for a treatment predictive effect was weak.This trial is registered in the ISRCTN database, trial ID: ISRCTN12474687 .",
  "A health-conscious lifestyle may protect against breast cancer in situ. However, breast cancer in situ is mainly detected by screening, and many studies lack information on screening participation. Thus, we evaluated the association between prediagnostic lifestyle and risk of breast cancer in situ, accounting for screening participation at recruitment. A score reflecting the adherence to the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research cancer prevention recommendations was constructed, using the recommendations on healthy body weight, physical activity, consumption of plant-based foods, red and processed meat, alcohol and avoidance of sugar. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to investigate the association between the lifestyle score and breast cancer in situ risk, while accounting for important confounders. The lifestyle score was not significantly associated with breast cancer in situ risk (HR<sub>continuous</sub> \u00a0=\u00a00.96, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.91-1.03) in the overall cohort. In participants not reporting dietary changes in the past 5\u2009years, the lifestyle score was inversely associated with breast cancer in situ risk (HR<sub>continuous</sub> \u00a0=\u00a00.92, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.85-0.99). In those reporting dietary changes in the past 5\u2009years due to illness or other reasons, the lifestyle score was not associated with breast cancer in situ risk (HR<sub>continuous</sub> \u00a0=\u00a01.04, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.94-1.15). Lifestyle was inversely associated with breast cancer in situ risk in women not reporting recent changes in their dietary habits. This inverse association is consistent with inverse associations reported in previous studies. Our findings suggest that breast cancer in situ and invasive breast cancer share a similar risk factor profile.",
  "Studies investigating breast cancer polygenic risk score (PRS) in Chinese women are scarce. The objectives of this study were to develop and validate PRSs that could be used to stratify risk for overall and subtype-specific breast cancer in Chinese women, and to evaluate the performance of a newly proposed Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based approach for PRS construction.The PRSs were constructed using the dataset from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and validated in an independent case-control study. Three approaches, including repeated logistic regression (RLR), logistic ridge regression (LRR) and ANN based approach, were used to build the PRSs for overall and subtype-specific breast cancer based on 24 selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Predictive performance and calibration of the PRSs were evaluated unadjusted and adjusted for Gail-2 model 5-year risk or classical breast cancer risk factors.The primary PRS<sub>ANN</sub> and PRS<sub>LRR</sub> both showed modest predictive ability for overall breast cancer (odds ratio per interquartile range increase of the PRS in controls [IQ-OR] 1.76 vs 1.58; area under the receiver operator characteristic curve [AUC] 0.601 vs 0.598) and remained to be predictive after adjustment. Although estrogen receptor negative (ER<sup>-</sup>) breast cancer was poorly predicted by the primary PRSs, the ER<sup>-</sup> PRSs trained solely on ER<sup>-</sup> breast cancer cases saw a substantial improvement in predictions of ER<sup>-</sup> breast cancer.The 24 SNPs based PRSs can provide additional risk information to help breast cancer risk stratification in the general population of China. The newly proposed ANN approach for PRS construction has potential to replace the traditional approaches, but more studies are needed to validate and investigate its performance.",
  "Scientific evidence imply the strong correlation between diabetes and breast cancer. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and its analogue liraglutide, have been widely used for diabetes treatment. However, the role of GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) in breast cancer requires further elucidation. This study aimed to investigate the risk and the molecular mechanisms of liraglutide using in breast cancer.Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blot or immunohistochemistry were used to detect the expressions of GLP-1R, NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in human triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) and tissues derived from BALB/cfC3H mouse bearing 4T1 cells inoculation. Cell proliferation and migration was detected using the Cell Counting Kit-8, adenosine triphosphate assay, and transwell assay, respectively. Flow cytometry was used to measure the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS).We found that the expression of GLP-1R increased after liraglutide treatment in breast cancer cells and the transplanted tumors. Liraglutide, at a slightly higher concentration, accelerated breast cancer progress in vitro (100\u00a0nM) and in vivo (400\u03bcg/kg) through the NOX4/ROS/VEGF signal pathway after activating GLP-1R. The GLP-1R inhibitor, Exendin (9-39), significantly inhibited the effect of liraglutide, inducing a reversed function of GLP-1R activation.Our study illustrated that in an approximately toxicology context, liraglutide may promote the malignant progression of TNBC. The dosage and the phenotype of the breast cancer should be considered as important factors for the rational administration of antidiabetic drugs, especially that of liraglutide in breast cancer patients.",
  "The role of post mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) in patients with N1mic breast cancer has not been well defined. A retrospective analysis was performed using the SEER database to evaluate the impact of PMRT on survival in patients with N1mic breast cancer.Women with T1-T2, N1mic, M0 breast cancer who had undergone mastectomy were analyzed. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables. Univariate analysis to assess for differences in survival with respect to covariates was performed using the log rank test while multivariate analysis was performed with Cox proportional hazards regression. Sub-cohort analysis with propensity score matching was used to assess differences in survival among patients undergoing PMRT vs no PMRT. Comparisons were considered statistically significant at P\u00a0<\u00a00.05.Among 5878 patients, 1202 (20%) underwent PMRT. On univariate analysis, PMRT was a significant predictor of CSS, but not OS. There was no difference in either OS or CSS between the PMRT vs no PMRT groups on multivariate Cox regression analysis and after propensity score matching.Among patients with T1-T2, N1mic, M0 breast IDC from the SEER database, there was no difference in either OS or CSS among patients who underwent PMRT vs no PMRT. These results suggest that PMRT does not impact survival among breast cancer patients with N1mic disease. However, additional prospective studies with longer follow up are necessary for further evaluation.",
  "The aim of this study was to evaluate the wage losses incurred by spouses of women with nonmetastatic breast cancer in the 6\u00a0months after the diagnosis.A prospective cohort study of spouses of women diagnosed with nonmetastatic breast cancer who were recruited in 8 hospitals in the province of Quebec (Canada) was performed. Information for estimating wage losses was collected by telephone interviews conducted 1 and 6\u00a0months after the diagnosis. Log-binomial regressions were used to identify personal, medical, and employment characteristics associated with experiencing wage losses, and generalized linear models were used to identify characteristics associated with the proportion of usual wages lost.Overall, 829 women (86% participation) and 406 spouses (75% participation) consented to participate. Among the 279 employed spouses, 78.5% experienced work absences because of breast cancer. Spouses were compensated for 66.3% of their salary on average during their absence. The median wage loss was $0 (mean, $1820)\u00a0(2003 Canadian dollars). Spouses were more likely to experience losses if they were self-employed or lived 50\u00a0km\u00a0or farther from the hospital. Among spouses who experienced wage losses, those who were self-employed or whose partners had invasive breast cancer lost a higher proportion of wages.Although spouses took some time off work, for many, the resulting wage losses were modest because of compensation received. Still, the types of compensation used may hide other forms of burden for families facing breast cancer.",
  "In breast cancer surgery, there has been a major shift toward less invasive local treatment. Although axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was an integral part of surgical treatment for breast cancer, sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy was developed as an accurate method for axillary staging. ALND can be avoided not only in patients with negative SLNs but also in those with one or two positive SLNs receiving breast and/or axillary radiation. On the other hand, ALND has remained the standard treatment for patients with clinically positive nodes. However, axillary reverse mapping (ARM) was developed to map and preserve arm lymphatic drainage during ALND and/or SLN biopsy. This procedure allowed reduction of the rate of arm lymphedema without increasing axillary recurrence, although patients receive postoperative chemotherapy and high-risk patients undergo axillary radiation. Standard ALND may not be necessary even for patients with clinically positive nodes who receive axillary radiation and systemic therapy. Thus, the extent of axillary surgery in breast cancer has been decreased with increased use of systemic and radiation therapy.",
  "Breast cancer survivors are at risk for contralateral breast cancer (CBC), with the consequent burden of further treatment and potentially less favorable prognosis. We aimed to develop and validate a CBC risk prediction model and evaluate its applicability for clinical decision-making.We included data of 132,756 invasive non-metastatic breast cancer patients from 20 studies with 4682 CBC events and a median follow-up of 8.8\u2009years. We developed a multivariable Fine and Gray prediction model (PredictCBC-1A) including patient, primary tumor, and treatment characteristics and BRCA1/2 germline mutation status, accounting for the competing risks of death and distant metastasis. We also developed a model without BRCA1/2 mutation status (PredictCBC-1B) since this information was available for only 6% of patients and is routinely unavailable in the general breast cancer population. Prediction performance was evaluated using calibration and discrimination, calculated by a time-dependent area under the curve (AUC) at 5 and 10\u2009years after diagnosis of primary breast cancer, and an internal-external cross-validation procedure. Decision curve analysis was performed to evaluate the net benefit of the model to quantify clinical utility.In the multivariable model, BRCA1/2 germline mutation status, family history, and systemic adjuvant treatment showed the strongest associations with CBC risk. The AUC of PredictCBC-1A was 0.63 (95% prediction interval (PI) at 5\u2009years, 0.52-0.74; at 10\u2009years, 0.53-0.72). Calibration-in-the-large was\u2009-0.13 (95% PI:\u2009-1.62-1.37), and the calibration slope was 0.90 (95% PI: 0.73-1.08). The AUC of Predict-1B at 10\u2009years was 0.59 (95% PI: 0.52-0.66); calibration was slightly lower. Decision curve analysis for preventive contralateral mastectomy showed potential clinical utility of PredictCBC-1A between thresholds of 4-10% 10-year CBC risk for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and non-carriers.We developed a reasonably calibrated model to predict the risk of CBC in women of European-descent; however, prediction accuracy was moderate. Our model shows potential for improved risk counseling, but decision-making regarding contralateral preventive mastectomy, especially in the general breast cancer population where limited information of the mutation status in BRCA1/2 is available, remains challenging.",
  "The primary aim of the international advance breast cancer (ABC) guidelines are to guide treatment decisions in many different healthcare settings, but need adaptations due to different access to care. These guidelines are based on the most up-to-date evidence. However, Chinese experts have a different national condition and policies to face. The Chinese Anti-Cancer Association Committee of Breast Cancer Society guideline (CBCS guideline) is to guide treatments and to reflect unmet needs of Chinese breast cancer patients. Although, most of the recommendations in the two guidelines are the same, some of them are different. In this article, with regard to country-specific peculiarities, a working group of Chinese breast cancer experts compare the similarities and differences between the ABC guideline and CBCS guideline and commented on the voting results of the ABC panelists. We also discuss why these differences exist, such as lack of access, different tumor biology and epidemiology, and even different culture. The money which patients have to pay out of pocket for their medical cost and the availability of drugs lie at the heart of the issues of guideline differences.",
  "Diagnostic delay of breast cancer related to the false-negative assessment of the healthcare provider leads to tumor progression and might worsen the outcome. Previous studies found some factors associated with provider-related diagnostic delay; however, tumor biology has tended not to be considered. The aim of our study was to find differences in diagnostic delay of poorly differentiated breast cancer types.Data of 970 patients with newly diagnosed moderately/poorly differentiated (G2/3) breast cancer at the age \u226540 years was retrospectively analyzed regarding breast cancer type, diagnostic delay and its consequence, clinical factors and physician's assessment. Multivariate analysis was used to evaluate associated factors with diagnostic delay.We observed a diagnostic delay in 3.8% (n = 37) of all patients. Mean delay time was 128 days, and clinically relevant tumor growth was observed in 43.2% of these cases. Delay was significantly higher in the group of triple-negative breast cancer (9.9% versus 2.7, 5.3 and 1.8% in hormonal receptor (HR)+/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-, HR-/Her2+ and HR+/Her2+, respectively; P value <0.001). Age, breast density and reason for presentation were not correlated to diagnostic delay.Patients with triple-negative breast cancer are at higher risk of receiving a false-negative assessment and experiencing a diagnostic delay. Our results emphasize the importance of a detailed consideration of clinical risk factors and provider training and suggest a broad indication for a core needle biopsy.",
  "The complexity of breast cancer includes many interacting biological processes that make it difficult to find appropriate therapeutic treatments. Therefore, identifying potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers is urgently needed. Previous studies demonstrated that 26S proteasome delta subunit, non-ATPase (PSMD) family members significantly contribute to the degradation of damaged, misfolded, abnormal, and foreign proteins. However, transcriptional expressions of PSMD family genes in breast cancer still remain largely unexplored. Consequently, we used a holistic bioinformatics approach to explore PSMD genes involved in breast cancer patients by integrating several high-throughput databases, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), cBioPortal, Oncomine, and Kaplan-Meier plotter. These data demonstrated that PSMD1, PSMD2, PSMD3, PSMD7, PSMD10, PSMD12, and PSMD14 were expressed at significantly higher levels in breast cancer tissue compared to normal tissues. Notably, the increased expressions of PSMD family genes were correlated with poor prognoses of breast cancer patients, which suggests their roles in tumorigenesis. Meanwhile, network and pathway analyses also indicated that PSMD family genes were positively correlated with ubiquinone metabolism, immune system, and cell-cycle regulatory pathways. Collectively, this study revealed that PSMD family members are potential prognostic biomarkers for breast cancer progression and possible promising clinical therapeutic targets.",
  "Limited work has been performed for the implementation of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) in breast cancer surveillance imaging. The aim of this study was to investigate the differences between two different DBT implementations in breast cancer surveillance imaging, for patients with a personal history of breast cancer.The DBT implementations investigated were: (1) 2-view 2D digital mammography and 2-view DBT (2vDM&2vDBT) (2) 1-view (cranial-caudal) DM and 1-view (mediolateral-oblique) DBT (1vDM&1vDBT). Clinical performance of these two implementations was assessed retrospectively using observer studies with 118 sets of real patient images, from a single imaging centre, and six observers. Sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC) using the Jack-knife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristics (JAFROC) analysis were evaluated.Results suggest that the two DBT implementations are not significantly different in terms of sensitivity, specificity and AUC. When looking at the two main different lesion types, non-calcifications and calcifications, and two different density levels, no difference in the performance of the two DBT implementations was found.Since 1vDM&1vDBT exposes the patient to half the dose of 2vDM&2vDBT, it might be worth considering 1vDM&1vDBT in breast cancer surveillance imaging. However, larger studies are required to conclude on this matter.",
  "The aim of this study was to explore the role of galectin-3 in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer cells and the potential mechanism.Kaplan-Meier (KM)-plot and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases were used to study the role of galectin-3 in the prognosis of HER2-positive breast cancer. The effects of galectin-3 on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and colony formation ability in HER2-positive breast cancer cells were examined. The relationship between galectin-3 and important components in the HER2 pathways, including HER2, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), protein kinase B (AKT), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), was further studied. Lentivirus and CRISPR/Cas9 were used to construct stable cell lines. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and apoptosis assays were used to study the relationship between galectin-3 and trastuzumab. The effect of galectin-3 on cell stemness was studied by mammosphere formation assay. The effects of galectin-3 on stemness biomarkers and the Notch1 pathway were examined. Tumorigenic models were used to evaluate the effects of galectin-3 on tumorigenesis and the therapeutic effect of trastuzumab in vivo.HER2-positive breast cancer patients with a high expression level of LGALS3 (the gene encoding galectin-3) messenger RNA (mRNA) showed a poor prognosis. Galectin-3 promoted cancer malignancy through phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway activation and upregulated stemness by activating the Notch1 signaling pathway in HER2-positive breast cancer cells. These two factors contributed to the enhancement of trastuzumab resistance in cells. Knockout of LGALS3 had a synergistic therapeutic effect with trastuzumab both in vitro and in vivo.Galectin-3 may represent a prognostic predictor and therapeutic target for HER2-positive breast cancer.",
  "There are limited data on pretreatment imaging features that can predict response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). To extract volumetric pretreatment MRI radiomics features and assess corresponding associations with breast cancer molecular subtypes, pathological complete response (pCR), and residual cancer burden (RCB) in patients treated with NAC.In this IRB-approved study, clinical and pretreatment MRI data from patients with biopsy-proven breast cancer who received NAC between September 2009 and July 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Tumors were manually identified and semi-automatically segmented on first postcontrast images. Morphological and three-dimensional textural features were computed, including unfiltered and filtered image data, with spatial scaling factors (SSF) of 2, 4, and 6 mm. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were used for statistical analysis.Two hundred and fifty nine patients with unilateral breast cancer, including 73 (28.2%) HER2+, 112 (43.2%) luminal, and 74 (28.6%) triple negative breast cancers (TNBC), were included. There was a significant difference in the median volume (p\u202f=\u202f0.008), median longest axial tumor diameter (p\u202f=\u202f0.009), and median longest volumetric diameter (p\u202f=\u202f0.01) among tumor subtypes. There was also a significant difference in minimum signal intensity and entropy among the tumor subtypes with SSF\u202f=\u202f4 mm (p\u202f=\u202f0.009 and p\u202f=\u202f0.02 respectively) and SSF\u202f=\u202f6 mm (p\u202f=\u202f0.007 and p < 0.001 respectively). Additionally, sphericity (p\u202f=\u202f0.04) in HER2+ tumors and entropy with SSF\u202f=\u202f2, 4, 6 mm (p\u202f=\u202f0.004, 0.02, 0.047 respectively) in luminal tumors were significantly associated with pCR. Multiple features demonstrated significant association (p < 0.05) with pCR in TNBC and with RCB in luminal tumors and TNBC, with standard deviation of intensity with SSF\u202f=\u202f6 mm achieving the highest AUC (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.734) for pCR in TNBC.MRI radiomics features are associated with different molecular subtypes of breast cancer, pCR, and RCB. These features may be noninvasive imaging biomarkers to identify cancer subtype and predict response to NAC.",
  "Oral inhibitors of CDK4/6 have been shown to increase response rates and prolong disease control when combined with endocrine therapy in hormone-responsive (HR+) HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. Palbociclib, ribociclib and abemaciclib are all approved in combination with non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors in first-line therapy for post-menopausal women, with a 40-45% improvement in progression-free survival seen with the addition of any of these CDK4/6 inhibitors. Additional approved indications, including first- and second-line combination therapy for pre-menopausal women, combination with fulvestrant and use as monotherapy, vary with each agent and are reviewed fully in the subsequent texts. These agents also differ in their toxicity profiles and monitoring requirements, and prescribers should be aware of the individual requirements for each agent. Current clinical trials are investigating the expanded use of these agents in other breast cancer subtypes, such as HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer, as well as in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatments of early breast cancer. Resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition can occur through multiple mechanisms. Rational combinations with other therapies, such as PI3K inhibitors, HER2-directed therapies and immunotherapy, are being explored.",
  "Though mammographic density (MD) has been proposed as an intermediate marker of breast cancer risk, few studies have examined whether the associations between breast cancer risk factors and risk are mediated by MD, particularly by tumor characteristics.Our study population included 3392 cases (1105 premenopausal) and 8882 (3192 premenopausal) controls from four case-control studies. For established risk factors, we estimated the percent of the total risk factor association with breast cancer that was mediated by percent MD (secondarily, by dense area and non-dense area) for invasive breast cancer as well as for subtypes defined by the estrogen receptor (ER+/ER-), progesterone receptor (PR+/PR-), and HER2 (HER2+/HER2-). Analyses were conducted separately in pre- and postmenopausal women.Positive associations between prior breast biopsy and risk of invasive breast cancer as well as all subtypes were partially mediated by percent MD in pre- and postmenopausal women (percent mediated\u2009=\u200911-27%, p\u2009\u2264\u20090.02). In postmenopausal women, nulliparity and hormone therapy use were positively associated with invasive, ER+\u2009, PR+\u2009, and HER2- breast cancer; percent MD partially mediated these associations (percent mediated\u2009\u2265\u200931%, p\u2009\u2264\u20090.02). Further, among postmenopausal women, percent MD partially mediated the positive association between later age at first birth and invasive as well as ER+\u2009breast cancer (percent mediated\u2009=\u200916%, p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05).Percent MD partially mediated the associations between breast biopsy, nulliparity, age at first birth, and hormone therapy with risk of breast cancer, particularly among postmenopausal women, suggesting that these risk factors at least partially influence breast cancer risk through changes in breast tissue composition.",
  "Studies have suggested that type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with a higher incidence of breast cancer and related mortality rates. T2D postmenopausal women have an ~20% increased chance of developing breast cancer, and women with T2D and breast cancer have a 50% increase in mortality compared to breast cancer patients without diabetes. This correlation has been attributed to the general activation of insulin receptor signaling, glucose metabolism, phosphatidylinositol (PI) kinases, and growth pathways. Furthermore, the presence of breast cancer specific PI kinase and/or phosphatase mutations enhance metastatic breast cancer phenotypes. We hypothesized that each of the breast cancer subtypes may have characteristic PI phosphorylation profiles that are changed in T2D conditions. Therefore, we sought to characterize the PI phosphorylation when equilibrated in normal glycemic versus hyperglycemic serum conditions. Our results suggest that hyperglycemia leads to: 1) A reduction in PI3P and PIP3, with increased PI4P that is later converted to PI(3,4)P2 at the cell surface in hormone receptor positive breast cancer; 2) a reduction in PI3P and PI4P with increased PIP3 surface expression in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer; and 3) an increase in di- and tri-phosphorylated PIs due to turnover of PI3P in triple negative breast cancer. This study begins to describe some of the crucial changes in PIs that play a role in T2D related breast cancer incidence and metastasis.",
  "Increasingly, patients with breast cancer undergo bilateral mastectomy (BLM). To the authors' knowledge, the magnitude of benefit is unknown.The authors used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program regarding all women diagnosed with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage 0 to stage III unilateral breast cancer in California from 1998 through 2015 and treated with BLM versus breast-conserving therapy including surgery and radiotherapy (BCT) or unilateral mastectomy (ULM). The authors measured relative risks of second contralateral breast cancer (CBC) and breast cancer death using Fine and Gray multivariable regression modeling adjusted for the competing risk of death and death from another cause, respectively, and potential confounding factors. Absolute excess risk of CBC was measured as the observed minus expected number of breast cancers in the general population divided by 10,000 person-years at risk.Among 245,418 patients with a median follow-up of 6.7\u00a0years, 7784 patients (3.2%) developed CBC. Relative risks were lower after BLM (hazard ratio [HR], 0.10; 95% CI, 0.07-0.14) and higher after ULM (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.02-1.13) versus BCT. Absolute excess risks were higher after BCT and ULM (5.0 and 13.6 more cases, respectively) compared with BLM (28.6 fewer cases). BLM reduced risk more among older women (38.0 fewer cases for women aged \u226550\u00a0years vs 17.9 fewer cases among women aged <50\u00a0years) but provided similar risk reduction across categories of tumor grade and tumor hormone receptor status. Compared with BCT, the risk of breast cancer death was equivalent after BLM (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.96-1.11) and higher after ULM (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.17-1.25).BLM may reduce second breast cancer risk by 34 to 43 cases per 10,000 person-years compared with other surgical procedures, but is not associated with a lower risk of death. Second breast cancers are rare, and their reduction should be weighed against the harms associated with BLM.",
  "Our previous study demonstrated that bromodomain\u2011containing protein\u00a07 (BRD7) inhibits cell proliferation and tumor growth, restoring the expression of B\u2011cell lymphoma\u00a02 antagonist/killer (Bak) sensitized breast cancer cells to paclitaxel. However, the association between BRD7 and paclitaxel sensitization, as well as BRD7 and Bak in breast cancer remains unknown. In the present study, immunochemical staining was performed to measure the expression of BRD7 and Bak in breast cancer tissues. Cell Counting Kit\u20118 assay, flow cytometry and tumor xenograft procedures were performed to evaluate the biological role of BRD7 and Bak in breast cancer cells. Western blotting, reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction, chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays were also performed. BRD7 was positively correlated with Bak levels in breast cancer tissues, and the survival rate of patients with low Bak and BRD7 expression was significantly lower than that of patients with high Bak and BRD7 expression. In addition, BRD7 activated Bak promoter activity and induced Bak expression in an indirect manner. Furthermore, ectopic expression of BRD7 inhibited cell proliferation, tumor growth and sensitized cancer cells to paclitaxel, while knockdown of Bak abolished BRD7\u2011mediated inhibitory effects on cell proliferation and paclitaxel sensitization in breast cancer cells whether in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. The results demonstrated that BRD7 inhibits cell proliferation and sensitizes breast cancer cells to paclitaxel by activating Bak; they also provide promising targets for the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.",
  "Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) have had clinical success in treating hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Notably, CDK4/6i have expanded to the neoadjuvant setting for early breast cancer and other cancer types and potently synergize with immunotherapy. Other CDKs, including CDK7, CDK9, and CDK12/13, mainly function in transcriptional processes as well as cell cycle regulation, RNA splicing, and DNA damage response. Inhibiting these CDKs aids in suppressing tumors, reversing drug resistance, increasing drug sensitivity, and enhancing anti-tumor immunity in breast cancer.We reviewed the applications of CDK4/6i, CDK7i, CDK9i and CDK12/13i for various breast cancer subtypes and their potentials for combination with immunotherapy. A literature search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science was conducted in April 2022.The use of CDK4/6i represents a major milestone in breast cancer treatment. Moreover, transcription-related CDKs play critical roles in tumor development and are promising therapeutic targets for breast cancer. Some relevant clinical studies are underway. More specific and efficient CDKis will undoubtedly be developed and clinically tested. Characterization of their immune-priming effects will promote the development of combination therapies consisting of CDKi and immunotherapy.",
  "L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1), also referred to as SLC7A5, is believed to regulate tumor metabolism and be associated with tumor proliferation. In invasive breast cancer, we clinicopathologically investigated the utility of LAT1 expression. LAT1 expression was evaluated via immunohistochemistry analyses in 250 breast cancer patients undergoing long-term follow-up. We assessed the relationships between LAT1 expression and patient outcomes and clinicopathological factors. Breast cancer-specific survival stratified by LAT1 expression was assessed. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive patients with metastasis received trastuzumab therapy. The density of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was evaluated according to the International Working Group guidelines. In the current study, high LAT1 expression was significantly correlated with estrogen receptor (ER) negativity, progesterone receptor negativity, high histological grade, increased TILs, and programmed death ligand 1 positivity. Among the ER-positive and HER2-negative patients, high LAT1 was an independent indicator of poor outcomes (hazard ratio (HR)\u2009=\u20092.97; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.16-7.62; p\u2009=\u20090.023). Moreover, high LAT1 expression was an independent poor prognostic factor in luminal B-like breast cancer with aggressive features (HR\u2009=\u20093.39; 95% CI 1.35-8.52; p\u2009=\u20090.0094). In conclusion, high LAT1 expression could be used to identify a subgroup of invasive breast cancer characterized by aggressive behavior and high tumor immunoreaction. Our findings suggest that LAT1 might be a candidate therapeutic target for breast cancer patients, particularly those with luminal B-like type breast cancer.",
  "Ferroptosis is a novel iron-dependent form of cell death, which\u00a0is implicated in various diseases including cancers. However, the influence of ferroptosis-related genes on the prognosis of breast cancer remains unclear.RNA sequencing data of 1053 breast cancer tissue samples and 111 normal tissue samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analyzed. Expression levels of 259 ferroptosis-related genes were compared. Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Gene and Genomic Encyclopedia (KEGG) analyses were conducted on differentially expressed genes. Cox univariate analysis was conducted to explore the potential prognostic biomarkers of breast cancer. Infiltrating immune cell status was assessed.A total of 66 ferroptosis-related genes were differentially expressed in breast cancer tissues. The enriched GO terms included Biological Process (mainly included response to oxidative stress, cellular response to chemical stress, multicellular organismal homeostasis, cofactor metabolic process, response to metal ion, response to steroid hormone, cellular response to oxidative stress, transition metal ion homeostasis, iron ion homeostasis, and cellular iron ion homeostasis), Cellular Component (mainly included apical plasma membrane, early endosome, apical part of cell, lipid droplet, basolateral plasma membrane, blood microparticle, clathrin-coated pit, caveola, astrocyte projection, and pronucleus) and Molecular Function (mainly included iron ion binding, ubiquitin protein ligase binding, oxidoreductase activity, acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen, oxidoreductase activity, acting on the CH-OH group of donors, NAD or NADP as acceptor, ferric iron binding, aldo-keto reductase (NADP) activity, oxidoreductase activity, acting on single donors with incorporation of molecular oxygen, steroid dehydrogenase activity, alditol:NADP+1-oxidoreductase activity, and alcohol dehydrogenase (NADP+) activity). The enriched KEGG pathway mainly included the HIF-1\u00a0signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, ferroptosis, IL-17\u00a0signaling pathway, central carbon metabolism in cancer, PPAR signaling pathway, PD-L1 expression, and PD-1 checkpoint pathway in cancer. Among them, 38 ferroptosis-related genes were significantly associated with the prognosis of breast cancer. The prognostic model was constructed, and breast cancer patients in low-risk group had a better prognosis. In addition, risk score of ferroptosis prognostic model was negatively correlated with B cells (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.063, p\u00a0=\u00a00.049), CD8+ T cells (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.083, p\u00a0=\u00a00.010), CD4+ T cells (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.097, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), neutrophils (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.068, p\u00a0=\u00a00.033), and dendritic cells (r\u00a0=\u00a00.088, p\u00a0=\u00a00.006).The ferroptosis pathway plays a key role in breast cancer. Some differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes can be used as prognostic biomarkers for breast cancer.",
  "Overall survival in breast cancer patients receiving a delayed deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap breast reconstruction is better than in those without delayed breast reconstruction. This study aimed at determining the impact of socioeconomic status (SES) and comorbidity on these observations.This matched cohort study included all consecutive women undergoing a delayed DIEP flap reconstruction at Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden, between 1999 and 2013. Controls had not received any delayed breast reconstruction and were relapse-free after a corresponding follow-up interval. Matching was by year of and age at mastectomy, tumour stage and lymph node status. Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and socioeconomic data were obtained from national registers. Associations with breast cancer-specific (BCSS) and overall survival (OS) were investigated by Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and Cox proportional hazard regression analysis.Women in the DIEP group (N\u00a0=\u00a0254) more often continued education after primary school (88.6% versus 82.6%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.026), belonged to the high-income group (76.0% versus 63.1%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), were in a partnership (57.1% versus 55.7%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.024) and healthier (median CCI 1.00 (range 0-13) versus 2.00 (range 0-16), P\u00a0=\u00a00.021) than the control group (N\u00a0=\u00a0729). After adjustment for tumour and treatment factors, SES and comorbidity, OS remained significantly better for the DIEP group than the control group (HR 2.27, 95% CI 1.44-3.55).Women with a delayed DIEP flap reconstruction are a subgroup of higher socioeconomic status and better health. Higher survival estimates for the DIEP group persisted after adjusting for those differences, suggesting the presence of further unmeasured covariates.",
  "Male breast cancer (MBC) is often diagnosed at a later stage and with a more unfavorable tumor-to-breast ratio compared to women, prompting lower rates of breast conservation (BCT). We sought to assess the practice patterns of neoadjuvant therapy (NT) in MBC patients and the impact on BCT.Men with nonmetastatic, invasive breast cancer were identified from the National Cancer Database. Patients were categorized as having small (cT1/2) or locally advanced (cT3/4) tumors and by whether they received NT (which included endocrine or chemotherapy). Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed to assess patterns of NT use and rates BCT.Of 15,151 male patients, 4.8% received NT and 21.6% underwent BCT. NT was more common among males with cT3/4 tumors than those with cT1/2 tumors (8.2 vs. 2.1%, P < .001). Overall, unadjusted rates of BCT were higher for patients receiving NT in the cT3/4 subgroup (19.0 vs. 12.5%, P < .001), a difference which persisted on multivariable analysis. For all patients analyzed, overall survival (OS) did not differ between males who underwent NT and those who did not (110 vs. 122 months, P\u00a0=\u00a0.67), but NT was associated with poorer OS in both univariate and multivariate analyses for patients with cT3/4 tumors (both P < .01).Men with invasive breast cancer have an expected low rate of BCT, but NT appears to reduce the use of mastectomy in patients with locally advanced cancers. More work is needed to understand the impacts of BCT on locoregional recurrence and disease-free and overall survival for MBC.",
  "Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women. Hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer (HR\u00a0+\u00a0BC) is the most common pathological type of breast cancer, of which the main treatment method is endocrine therapy. Unfortunately, primary or acquired drug resistance greatly limits its efficacy. In recent years, the newly launched CDK4/6 inhibitors could effectively reverse endocrine resistance in breast cancer. However, considering their expensive price and side effects, it is particularly important to find out effective biomarkers and screen sensitive patients. Here, we found through bioinformatics analysis that high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) expression increased in endocrine-resistant HR\u00a0+\u00a0BC. In clinical specimens, the higher expression of HMGB1 was associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) for HR\u00a0+\u00a0BC patients with endocrine therapy after surgery. For endocrine-resistant breast cancer, compared with HMGB1-negative patients, HMGB1-positive patients who received CDK4/6 inhibitors treatment benefited more in PFS. Moreover, we demonstrated that HMGB1 promoted tamoxifen resistance by combining with the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and activating nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) pathway. CDK4/6 inhibitors could downregulate the expression of HMGB1 and suppress the TLR4-NF-\u03baB pathway, and in turn reverse tamoxifen resistance. These results illuminated the critical role of HMGB1 in the process of tamoxifen resistance, explained the mechanism of CDK4/6 inhibitors reversing tamoxifen resistance, and suggested the feasibility of HMGB1 as a potential biomarker for screening sensitive patients receiving CDK4/6 inhibitors.",
  "A deeper insight into tumor biology and HER2 signaling has led to the development of novel anti-HER2 drugs that have significantly improved the prognosis of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. The breast cancer immune microenvironment has emerged as a potential prognostic factor. Moreover, the host immune system not only seems to play a critical role in the prognosis of HER2-positive breast cancer, but also seems to modulate treatment response to some HER2-targeted agents. Here, we review the latest evidence of the role of immunotherapy in HER2-positive breast cancer and present emerging strategies.",
  "Lethal giant larvae homolog 2 (LLGL2) and solute carrier family 7 member 5 (SLC7A5) have been reported to be involved in resistance to endocrine therapy. This study aimed to assess the effects of LLGL2/SLC7A5 co-expression in predicting prognosis and response to tamoxifen therapy in ER\u03b1-positive breast cancer patients according to LLGL2/SLC7A5 mRNA and protein expression in long-term follow-up invasive breast cancer tissues. We identified that low LLGL2/SLC7A5 mRNA co-expression (LLGL2<sup>low</sup>/SLC7A5<sup>low</sup>) was associated with disease-free survival (DFS) compared with other combination groups in all breast cancer patients. In ER\u03b1-positive breast cancer patients, LLGL2<sup>low</sup>/SLC7A5<sup>low</sup> showed longer DFS and overall survival (OS) compared with LLGL2<sup>high</sup>/SLC7A5<sup>high</sup> and a positive trend of longer survival compared with the other combination groups. We also observed that LLGL2<sup>low</sup>/SLC7A5<sup>low</sup> showed longer survival compared with LLGL2<sup>high</sup>/SLC7A5<sup>high</sup> in ER\u03b1-positive breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that LLGL2<sup>low</sup>/SLC7A5<sup>low</sup> was an independent favorable prognostic factor of both DFS and OS, not only in all breast cancer patients, but also in ER\u03b1-positive breast cancer patients. High co-expression of LLGL2 and SLC7A5 protein showed a positive trend of shorter survival. Our study showed that co-expression of LLGL2 and SLC7A5 mRNA is a promising candidate biomarker in early breast cancer patients.",
  "Lymphedema is a prevalent long-term effect of breast cancer treatment associated with reduced quality of life. This study examined the efficacy of nighttime compression as a self-management strategy for women with chronic breast cancer-related lymphedema.Th authors conducted a parallel 3-arm, multicenter, randomized trial. Women were recruited from 3 centers in Canada and randomized to group 1 (daytime compression garment alone [standard care]), group 2 (daytime compression garment plus nighttime compression bandaging), or group 3 (daytime compression garment plus the use of a nighttime compression system garment). The primary outcome was the change in excess arm volume from the baseline to 12\u00a0weeks. Participants from all groups used a nighttime compression system garment from weeks 13 to 24.One hundred twenty women were enrolled, 118 completed the randomized trial, and 114 completed the 24-week follow-up. The rates of adherence to nighttime compression were 95%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015% and 96%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011% in the compression bandaging and nighttime compression system groups, respectively. After the intervention, the addition of nighttime compression was found to be superior to standard care for both absolute milliliter reductions (P\u00a0=\u00a0.006) and percentage reductions (P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) in excess arm lymphedema volume. Significant within-group changes were seen for quality of life across all groups; however, no between-group differences were found (P\u00a0>\u00a0.05).The trial demonstrated a significant improvement in arm lymphedema volume from the addition of nighttime compression whether through the application of compression bandaging or through the use of a nighttime compression system garment.Lymphedema is swelling that occurs in the arm on the side of the surgery for breast cancer. Lymphedema occurs in approximately 21% of women. Lymphedema tends to worsen over time and can result in recurrent infections in the arm, functional impairment, and pain. Currently, treatment consists of intensive treatments to reduce the swelling followed by regular use of a compression sleeve during the day. This study examined and found a benefit from the addition of nighttime compression (whether through self-applied compression bandaging or through the use of a nighttime compression system garment) to the use of a daytime compression sleeve.",
  "Breast cancer (BC) serves as a prevalent and mortal malignancy among female globally. Ferroptosis, as an oxidative cell death that characterized by abnormal iron accumulation, plays critical role in cancer development. Ketamine is a rapid-acting anesthetic agent and has presented potential anti-tumor properties. However, the effect of Ketamine on breast cancer is still obscure. Here, we aimed to explore the function of Ketamine in the modulation of proliferation and ferroptosis of breast cancer cells. The cell viability of breast cancer cells was repressed by the treatment of Ketamine, while ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin 1 and apoptosis inhibitor ZVAD-FMK could restore the cell viability. The treatment of Ketamine significantly decreased the Edu-positive breast cancer cells and the colony formation numbers, and the treatment of ferrostatin 1 reversed the effect of Ketamine. We observed that the levels of ferroptosis markers, such as MDA, lipid ROS, and Fe<sup>2+</sup> were increased by the treatment of Ketamine in breast cancer cells. Regarding to the mechanism, we found that Ketamine inhibited the expression of GPX4, an anti-ferroptosis factor, by attenuating KAT5 on the promoter region of GPX4, repressing the enrichment of histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) and RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II). The treatment of Ketamine reduced the cell viability and proliferation of breast cancer cells, in which the overexpression of KAT5 or GPX4 was able to restore the phenotypes. The treatment of Ketamine induced the levels of MDA, lipid ROS, and Fe<sup>2+</sup>, while KAT5 or GPX4 overexpression could reverse this effect in breast cancer cells. Thus, we concluded that Ketamine suppressed proliferation and induced ferroptosis of breast cancer cells by targeting KAT5/GPX4 axis. Ketamine may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for breast cancer.",
  "Breast cancer screening utilization steeply dropped at the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, the effects on breast cancer screening in lower income populations are unknown. This study examined changes in breast cancer screening rates (BCSRs) during the pandemic among 32 community health centers (CHCs) that provided health care to lower income populations.Secondary data from 32 CHCs participating in an American Cancer Society grant program to increase breast cancer screening services were used. BCSRs were defined as the percentage of women aged 50 to 74 years who had a medical visit in the past 12 months (142,207 in 2018, 142,003 in 2019, and 150,630 in 2020) and received a screening mammogram within the last 27 months. BCSRs in July 2020, July 2019, and June 2018 were compared with screening rate ratios (SRRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).BCSRs significantly rose by 18% between 2018 and 2019 (from 45.8% to 53.9%; SRR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.17-1.18) and then declined by 8% between 2019 and 2020 (from 53.9% to 49.6%; SRR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.92-0.93). If the 2018-2019 BCSR trends had continued through 2020, 63.3% of women would have been screened in 2020 in contrast to the 49.6% who were; this potentially translated into 47,517 fewer mammograms and 242 missed breast cancer diagnoses in this population.In this study of 32 CHCs, BCSRs declined by 8% from July 2019 to 2020, and this reversed an 18% improvement between July 2018 and 2019. Declining BCSRs among CHCs during the COVID-19 pandemic call for policies to support and resources to identify women in need of screening.",
  "<b><i>Aims:</i></b> Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 (hnRNPA2/B1) is highly expressed in multiple types of tumor tissues and could potentially be used as a biomarker for the early detection of lung cancer. However, there is little evidence supporting its clinical significance as a prognostic marker in breast cancer. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> We retrospectively analyzed the protein expression and localization of hnRNPA2/B1 protein in breast cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues from 50 patients with Stage II and III breast cancer who were treated at Shanxi Provincial People's Hospital from May 2018 to May 2019 using western blot, and immunofluorescent and immunohistochemical staining assays. In addition, bioinformatic analyses using the Affymetrix Human Genome database were performed to examine the mRNA levels of <i>hnRNPA2/B1</i> in normal and breast cancer tissues, and to determine their correlation with the survival rates of breast cancer patients. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Based on the cohort of 50 patients, HnRNPA2/B1 protein was expressed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of breast cancer cells. The protein levels of hnRNPA2/B1 in breast cancer tissues were significantly higher than those in adjacent normal tissues (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001). Furthermore, bioinformatic analyses of hnRNPA2/B1 mRNA expression levels demonstrated that they were negatively correlated with overall survival and disease-specific survival rates in breast cancer patients. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Our study indicates that hnRNPA2/B1 could serve as a novel prognostic biomarker for breast cancer.",
  "Breast cancer is a malignant tumor that poses a serious threat to the health of women worldwide. The early diagnosis of patients with cancer or those at high risk remains difficult, which makes treatment challenging. Therefore, the study of diagnostic biomarkers for early detection of cancer is very important. AGP biomarkers are expected to be potential biomarkers for early detection of breast cancer. This study aimed to explore the potential of alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) as a biomarker for the diagnosis of breast cancer. The results revealed that the expression of AGP was high in breast cancer cells and tissues and was higher at stage IV than at stages III and II. Knockdown of <i>ORM1</i>, which encodes AGP, in MCF-7 cells suppressed the production of the inflammatory factors interleukin <i>(IL)-1\u03b2, IL-8</i>, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1. These results suggest that AGP can serve as a therapeutic target and/or diagnostic marker for breast cancer. Overall, we found that AGP can serve as a biomarker for breast cancer and inhibit secretion of related pro-inflammatory facto by blocking ORM1 expression.",
  "Breast cancer has the highest incidence and death rate among cancers in women worldwide. In particular, metastatic estrogen receptor negative (ER-) breast cancer and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes have very limited treatment options, with low survival rates. Ubiquitin carboxyl terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1), a ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase belonging to the deubiquitinase (DUB) family of enzymes, is highly expressed in these cancer types, and several key reports have revealed emerging and important roles for UCHL1 in breast cancer. However, selective and potent small-molecule UCHL1 inhibitors have been disclosed only very recently, alongside chemical biology approaches to detect regulated UHCL1 activity in cancer cells. These tools will enable novel insights into oncogenic mechanisms driven by UCHL1, and identification of substrate proteins deubiquitinated by UCHL1, with the ultimate goal of realising the potential of UCHL1 as a drug target in breast cancer.",
  "To assess knowledge of obesity-associated cancer risk, self-awareness of BMI status, and willingness to engage in weight loss intervention in breast cancer survivors with overweight and obesity as a companion study for a novel weight loss program using a telehealth platform (NCT04855552).Breast cancer survivors with BMI\u2009\u2265\u200925\u00a0kg/m<sup>2</sup> were surveyed to assess self-perception of BMI, knowledge of obesity-related cancer risk, and willingness to participate in weight loss programs. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with willingness to participate.Of the 122 participants, 73 (59.8%) had BMI 25.0-29.9\u00a0kg/m<sup>2</sup> (overweight) and 49 (40.2%) had BMI\u2009\u2265\u200930 (obesity). Patients with obesity were more likely to underestimate their BMI than those with overweight, 40.8% vs. 23.3% (p\u2009=\u20090.03). The majority (82.0%) indicated awareness that obesity increases breast cancer risk and 57.4% expressed interest in a weight loss program. Patients with knowledge of obesity-related breast cancer risk (91.4% willing vs. 69.2% not willing, p\u2009<\u20090.01) were more willing to participate in a weight loss program on univariable and multivariable analyses (p\u2009<\u20090.01).Our results underscore the importance of raising patients' awareness of obesity-related health risks and individual BMI category. Future work in the development of better education and communication tools to improve awareness will likely improve the adoption rate of healthy lifestyles in at-risk patients.",
  "\u00a0Many developed and non-developed countries worldwide suffer from cancer-related fatal diseases. In particular, the rate of breast cancer in females increases daily, partially due to unawareness and undiagnosed at the early stages. A proper first breast cancer treatment can only be provided by adequately detecting and classifying cancer during the very early stages of its development. The use of medical image analysis techniques and computer-aided diagnosis may help the acceleration and the automation of both cancer detection and classification by also training and aiding less experienced physicians. For large datasets of medical images, convolutional neural networks play a significant role in detecting and classifying cancer effectively.\u00a0This article presents a novel computer-aided diagnosis method for breast cancer classification (both binary and multi-class), using a combination of deep neural networks (ResNet 18, ShuffleNet, and Inception-V3Net) and transfer learning on the BreakHis publicly available dataset.\u00a0Our proposed method provides the best average accuracy for binary classification of benign or malignant cancer cases of 99.7%, 97.66%, and 96.94% for ResNet, InceptionV3Net, and ShuffleNet, respectively. Average accuracies for multi-class classification were 97.81%, 96.07%, and 95.79% for ResNet, Inception-V3Net, and ShuffleNet, respectively.",
  "This study aims to investigate the relationship between breast white adipose tissue (WAT) inflammation and being overweight or obese, menopausal status, and metabolic syndrome-related indicators in breast cancer patients as well as the association between adipocyte size and the severity of WAT inflammation and body mass index (BMI).The crown-like structures (CLS-B) formed by macrophages surrounding dying or dead adipocytes can be used to identify breast WAT inflammation. In this study, breast WAT and fasting blood from 136 Chinese women with breast cancer were collected for analysis. Cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68) immunohistochemical staining was performed to identify CLS-B, and the adipocyte size was measured by hematoxylin and eosin staining.The results showed that breast WAT inflammation usually occurs in overweight/obese breast cancer patients, and the severity of inflammation is positively correlated with adipocyte hypertrophy. We did not observe a direct association between WAT inflammation and menopausal status. In addition, the presence of WAT inflammation is associated with abnormalities in circulating factors associated with metabolic syndrome such as higher serum lipid, glucose, and C-reactive protein levels.Overweight/obese breast cancer patients may be more prone to breast WAT inflammation and may be associated with abnormalities in circulatory markers associated with metabolic syndrome.",
  "Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2(HER2) status is a crucial predictive factor for prognostic assessment and targeted therapy selection, which may be influenced by intratumor heterogeneity and molecular divergence between the primary site and different metastases. Therefore, we performed a prospective study to confirm the concordance of HER2 amplification in circulating tumor DNA(ctDNA) with primary tumor tissue and verified its clinical implications.A total of 105 breast cancer patients were enrolled, and dynamic monitoring of HER2 copy numbers in ctDNA was conducted in 31 participants during the treatment. Totally 186 plasma samples were prospectively obtained and blinded to test HER2 copy numbers in ctDNA based on low-coverage whole genome sequencing(WGS) by next-generation sequencing(NGS).Comparing HER2 copy numbers in ctDNA collected before the initiation of next line of anticancer treatment with primary tumor tissue, the concordant rate of HER2 amplification was 86.5%(\u03c7<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a052.901, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), with a positive and negative predictive value of 94.9% and 80.7%, respectively. Histopathologically positive, high-level amplification of HER2 copy numbers in the baseline was significantly correlated with best objective response during the anticancer therapy(p\u00a0=\u00a00.010). Moreover, HER2 copy numbers fluctuated with HER2-targeted therapeutic response, and the patients with a constantly positive level after 6 weeks of treatment appeared to suffer from significantly reduced progression free survival(p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).HER2 amplification in ctDNA, with a concordance rate of over 80% with primary tumors, may be a predictive index for prognostic evaluation and therapeutic response monitoring in a noninvasive, repeatable and practical method for breast cancer patients.",
  "Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women in the USA. Improved survival has resulted in increasing incidence of second primary malignancies, of which lung cancer is the most common. The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines for lung-cancer screening do not include previous malignancy as a high-risk feature requiring evaluation. The aim of this study was to compare women undergoing resection for lung cancer with and without a history of breast cancer and to assess whether there were differences in stage at diagnosis, survival and eligibility for lung-cancer screening between the two groups.Women who underwent lung-cancer resection between 2000 and 2017 were identified. Demographic, clinicopathological, treatment and outcomes data were compared between patients with a history of breast cancer (BC-Lung) and patients without a history of breast cancer (P-Lung) before lung cancer.Of 2192 patients included, 331 (15.1 per cent) were in the BC-Lung group. The most common method of lung-cancer diagnosis in the BC-Lung group was breast-cancer surveillance or work-up imaging. Patients in the BC-Lung group had an earlier stage of lung cancer at the time of diagnosis. Five-year overall survival was not statistically significantly different between groups (73.3 per cent for both). Overall, 58.4 per cent of patients (1281 patients) had a history of smoking, and 33.3 per cent (731 patients) met the current criteria for lung-cancer screening.Differences in stage at diagnosis of lung cancer and treatment selection were observed between patients with and without a history of breast cancer. Overall, there were no statistically significant differences in genomic or oncogenic pathway alterations between the two groups, which suggests that lung cancer in patients who previously had breast cancer may not be affected at the genomic level by the previous breast cancer. The most important finding of the study was that a high percentage of women with lung cancer, regardless of breast-cancer history, did not meet the current USPSTF criteria for lung-cancer screening.",
  "Preliminary clinical observations show that contemporaneous hereditary breast cancer (CHBC) patients suffered breast cancer at an early age, which requires further analysis.38 familial hereditary breast cancer patients (18 CHBC patients and 20 non-CHBC patients) were screened out and 152 non-hereditary breast cancer patients were used as control subjects. Clinical pathologic subtypes, age, tumor location, histological grade, lymph node metastasis, and molecular phenotype expression (ER, PR, HER-2, Ki-67, CK5/6, E-cad, P63, and P120) were compared across all subgroups.The incidence of CHBC was 9.47% (18/190) in breast cancer patients. The average ages of onset of CHBC patients, non-CHBC patients, and non-hereditary breast cancer patients were 49.06\u2009\u00b1\u20096.42, 60.75\u2009\u00b1\u20099.95 and 61.69\u2009\u00b1\u200914.34 respectively; whereas there were no significant differences with respect to pathological type or tumor location. There were significant differences in some histological grading (grade II/III), lymph node metastasis and PR expression between hereditary and non-hereditary breast cancers (P\u2009<\u20090.05; P\u2009<\u20090.05 and P\u2009<\u20090.005, respectively). Significantly different HER-2 expression was observed when comparing all hereditary or CHBC patients with non-hereditary breast cancers (P\u2009<\u20090.05 and P\u2009<\u20090.005, respectively). There were significant differences in E-cad and P63 between contemporaneous hereditary and non-hereditary breast cancers (P\u2009<\u20090.005 and P\u2009<\u20090.05, respectively).CHBC patients accounted for 9.47% (18/190) of breast cancer patients, had earlier disease onset, and showed differences compared to non-hereditary breast cancer patients with respect to molecular phenotype and clinical characteristics.",
  "ER\u03b1 positive breast cancer accounts for 70% of breast malignancies. Compared with ER\u03b1 negative types, ER\u03b1 positive breast cancer could be effective controlled by endocrine therapy. However, more than half of the patients will develop endocrine resistance, making it an important clinical issue for breast cancer therapy. Endocrine resistance might be caused by multiple alternations, including the components of ER\u03b1 signaling, during tumor progression. Thus, it is urgent and necessary to uncover the molecular mechanisms that controls ER\u03b1 expression and stability to improve breast cancer therapeutics. In our current study, we identifies that the ubiquitin ligase RNF181 stabilizes ER\u03b1 and facilitates breast cancer progression. The expression of RNF181 is correlated with ER\u03b1 level in human breast tumors and relates to poor survival in endocrine-treated patients. RNF181 depletion inhibits breast cancer progression in vivo and in vitro, reduces ER\u03b1 protein level and its target gene expression, such as PS2 and GREB1. Unbiased RNA sequencing analysis indicates RNF181 is necessary for ER\u03b1 signature gene expression in whole genomic level. Immuno-precipitation assays indicate that RNF181 associates with ER\u03b1 and promotes its stability possibly via inducing ER\u03b1 K63-linked poly-ubiquitination. In conclusion, our data implicate a non-genomic mechanism by RNF181 via stabilizing ER\u03b1 protein controls ER\u03b1 target gene expression linked to breast cancer progression.",
  "We have prepared the Japanese Breast Cancer Society clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for surgical treatment of breast cancer, 2018 update after a systematic review (SR) of the literature based upon the Medical Information Network Distribution Service (Minds) procedure. The CPG committee for surgical treatment of breast cancer, composed of breast surgeons and plastic surgeons treating breast cancer, has developed the CPGs. Eight clinical questions (CQs) were selected and divided roughly into the following five categories: (1) breast surgery in initial therapy (CQs 1-3); (2) axillary surgery in initial therapy (CQs 4-5); (3) breast reconstruction in initial therapy (CQ 6); (4) surgical treatment for recurrent and metastatic breast cancer (CQs 7-8); and (5) others. Recommendations for these CQs were decided by the GRADE grid method. In addition, 4 outlines, 14 background questions (BQs), and 12 future research questions (FQs) were also selected. Statements for these BQs and FQs are provided. We developed the updated CPGs for surgical treatment of breast cancer, 2018, which include 8 CQs and recommendations. As a decision-making tool for the understanding and treatment of breast cancer, these guidelines will help surgical oncologists dealing with breast cancer, medical staff, and patients, along with their family members.",
  "<b>Aim:</b> To assess the anxiety levels of breast cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Materials & methods:</b> A total of\u00a0298 patients completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S and STAI-T)\u00a0and the Visual Analogue Scale for Anxiety (VAS) and VAS for Anxiety in COVID-19 (VAS-CoV). <b>Results:</b> 144 patients were in the high anxiety category for STAI-S, and 202 patients were in the high anxiety category for STAI-T. STAI-T score was significantly high in the metastatic group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.017). VAS-CoV score in the hormonotherapy group was significantly higher than in\u00a0the no-treatment group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.023). There was a positive correlation between VAS-CoV and VAS levels (r\u00a0=\u00a00.708, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), VAS-CoV and STAI-S and STAI-T scores (r\u00a0=\u00a00.402, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; r\u00a0=\u00a00.185, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001, respectively), and a negative correlation between education years and STAI-T scores (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.172, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). <b>Conclusion:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic is related to high anxiety levels in breast cancer patients.",
  "Breast cancer, as the foremost cause of women's death in the world, is highly metastatic and mutable. Resistance to drugs for chemotherapies, endocrine therapies, and targeted therapies is an important factor that impacts the prognosis of breast cancer. Long non-coding ribonucleic acids (LncRNAs) are crucial regulators of intracellular gene expressions. Some researchers have suggested that expression level of several types of LncRNAs were closely related to the prognosis of patients with breast cancer. LncRNAs significantly impact biological processes such as drug transport, detoxication, apoptosis, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), and autophagy by regulating intracellular signaling pathways such as multi-drug resistance gene 1 (MDR1), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), BRCA1/2, and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB). This paper will summarize research progress on correlations between LncRNA and drug resistance of breast cancer. It will particularly expound molecular mechanisms through which LncRNAs regulate drug resistance of breast cancer. It will further discuss the feasibility as molecular markers for forecasting drug resistance of breast cancer and may be becoming new targets for treating breast cancer in the future.",
  "Chemoprevention reduces the risk of developing breast cancer in women with increased family history (FH) risk of breast cancer. However, chemoprevention uptake remains low and the reasons for this remain unclear.Patients with moderate- or high-risk FH of breast cancer were counselled about chemoprevention (n\u2009=\u20091620; September 2015 to July 2018) in breast clinics. A postal questionnaire survey was subsequently sent to these patients in order to explore the potential factors influencing their decision on chemoprevention uptake.518 patients (32%) completed the questionnaire survey; 75% were pre-menopausal and the majority had moderate as opposed to high-risk FH (87.5% vs. 12.5%). Breast cancer chemoprevention uptake rate was 10.8% (56/518). The identified incentives were more commonly stated for patients who took chemoprevention when compared to those who refused chemoprevention. The commonest incentives were breast cancer prevention (89.3% vs. 61.7%; p\u2009=\u20090.001), belief in the effectiveness of chemoprevention (76.8% vs. 63.4%; p\u2009=\u20090.048), and personal perception of breast cancer risk (67.9% vs. 45.5%; p\u2009=\u20090.002). Similarly, the identified barriers were more commonly stated for patients who refused chemoprevention when compared to those who took chemoprevention. The commonest barriers were side effects (79.4% vs. 55.4%; p\u2009=\u20090.001) and lack of information (53% vs. 28.6%; p\u2009=\u20090.001).Despite its proven efficacy, chemoprevention uptake in patients with a significant FH of breast cancer remains low. We have identified important factors which influence the patient's decision making. Future clinic consultations should focus on exploring these factors to aid patient decision making.",
  "Breast cancer risk remains higher in high-income compared with low-income countries. However, it is unclear to what degree metabolic factors influence breast cancer development in women 30\u2009years after immigration from low- to a high-incidence country.Using Cox regression models, we studied the association between pre-diagnostic metabolic factors and breast cancer development, and whether this association varied by ethnicity among 13,802 women participating in the population-based Oslo Ethnic Breast Cancer Study. Ethnic background was assessed and pre-diagnostic metabolic factors (body mass index, waist:hip ratio, serum lipids and blood pressure) were measured. A total of 557 women developed invasive breast cancer, and these women were followed for an additional 7.7\u2009years.Among women with an unfavorable metabolic profile, women from south Asia, compared with western European women, had a 2.3 times higher breast cancer risk (HR 2.30, 95% CI 1.18-4.49). Compared with the western European women, the ethnic minority women were more likely to present with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (OR 2.11, 95% CI 0.97-4.61), and less likely to complete all courses of planned taxane treatment (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.08-0.82). Among TNBC women, above-median triglycerides:HDL-cholesterol (>0.73) levels, compared with below-median triglycerides:HDL-cholesterol (\u22640.73) levels, was associated with 2.9 times higher overall mortality (HR 2.88, 95% CI 1.02-8.11).Our results support the importance of metabolic factors when balancing breast cancer prevention and disease management among all women, and in particular among non-western women migrating from a breast cancer low-incidence to a high-incidence country.",
  "Adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) in patients with breast cancer can adversely cause the heart to receive some radiation doses, which may lead to cardiovascular diseases. The results of previous research regarding this issue are not consistent. Therefore, we conducted a nationwide population-based study in Taiwan to evaluate whether adjuvant RT for breast cancer patients increased the risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD).This retrospective cohort study examined data from the National Health Insurance Research Database, Registry for Catastrophic Illness Patients, and Taiwan Cancer Registry Database. We identified 83,733 patients with breast cancer between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2017. Individuals without breast cancer from the general population were frequency-matched by age and index year with individuals with breast cancer. Participants were followed until the occurrence of a CHD event, the end of follow-up, or patient record removal due to death or withdrawal from the NHI. A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was conducted to compare the risk of CHD in breast cancer patients with that in patients in the comparison cohort.Compared to breast cancer patients without RT, those who underwent RT had a similar risk of subsequently developing CHD (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.87-1.02). Similar results were observed in a subgroup of patients with left-sided breast cancer. However, among patients who received adjuvant RT, those with left-sided breast cancer had a significantly higher risk of CHD than did those with right-sided breast cancer (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.30). Patients who received RT in 2010 or later had a significantly lower risk of CHD compared with those who received RT before 2010 (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.45-0.91). Higher prescribed doses of RT to the left-sided breast did not correspond to a higher risk of CHD.This large, nationwide cohort study suggests that adjuvant RT in patients with breast cancer did not increase the risk of CHD.",
  "More than 25 years ago, the first literature records mentioned HOXA1 expression in human breast cancer. A few years later, HOXA1 was confirmed as a proper oncogene in mammary tissue. In the following two decades, molecular data about the mode of action of the HOXA1 protein, the factors contributing to activate and maintain HOXA1 gene expression and the identity of its target genes have accumulated and provide a wider view on the association of this transcription factor to breast oncogenesis. Large-scale transcriptomic data gathered from wide cohorts of patients further allowed refining the relationship between breast cancer type and HOXA1 expression. Several recent reports have reviewed the connection between cancer hallmarks and the biology of HOX genes in general. Here we take HOXA1 as a paradigm and propose an extensive overview of the molecular data centered on this oncoprotein, from what its expression modulators, to the interactors contributing to its oncogenic activities, and to the pathways and genes it controls. The data converge to an intricate picture that answers questions on the multi-modality of its oncogene activities, point towards better understanding of breast cancer aetiology and thereby provides an appraisal for treatment opportunities.",
  "Quality indicators (QIs) for breast cancer care have been developed and applied in high-income countries and contributed to improved quality of care and patient outcomes over time.A modified Delphi process was used to derive expert consensus. Potential QIs were rated by a panel of 17 breast cancer experts from various subspecialties and across South African provinces. Each QI was rated according to importance to measure, scientific acceptability and feasibility. Scoring ranged from 1 (no agreement) to 5 (strong agreement). Inclusion thresholds were set a priori at mean ratings \u22654 with a coefficient variation of \u226525%. Levels of evidence were determined for each indicator.The literature review identified 790 potential QIs. After categorisation and removal of duplicates, 52 remained for panel review. There was strong consensus for 47 which were merged to 30 QIs by exclusion of similar indicators and indicator grouping. The final set included eight QIs with level I or II evidence and two QIs with level III evidence which were deemed \"mandatory\" due to clinical priority and impact on care. The remaining QIs with lower-level evidence were grouped as eight \"recommended\" QIs (regarded as standard of care) and twelve \"optional\" QIs (not regarded as standard of care).A regional set of QIs was developed to facilitate standardised treatment and auditing of surgical care for breast cancer patients in South Africa. Routine monitoring of the ten mandatory QIs, which were selected to have the most substantial impact on patient outcome, is proposed.",
  "Weight gain is common after breast cancer. Yoga, mindfulness meditation, and acupuncture may assist with managing weight. However, evidence on effectiveness is limited. This study assessed the feasibility and acceptability of recruiting for and implementing a randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating these interventions as adjuncts to lifestyle interventions (diet and exercise) for weight management in women with breast cancer.Qualitative study involving virtual focus groups or semi-structured interviews. Participants were recruited via email invitation from a breast cancer consumer organization and breast cancer center in Australia. Eligible participants had received treatment for breast cancer, and were fluent in English. A purposive sample of culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) participants was also recruited. Focus groups and interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis with the constant comparison method.Emails were sent to 1415 women of which 37 provided data in 5 focus groups and 1 semi-structured interview, including 1 focus group (n\u2009=\u20096) with only women from CALD backgrounds. Yoga and mindfulness meditation were perceived as feasible and acceptable for weight management, but acupuncture was seen to be too invasive to be acceptable. A focus on wellness rather than weight reduction, flexible program delivery, trusted advice, consideration of participant burden and benefit, and peer-support were key factors perceived to increase feasibility and acceptability.Yoga and mindfulness meditation are acceptable and useful adjuncts to lifestyle interventions for weight management after breast cancer. This research places end-users at the forefront of trial design, and will inform future trials using these interventions for weight management and improving health and wellbeing after breast cancer.",
  "BRCAness is characterized as the phenotypes shared between some sporadic tumors and BRCA1/2 mutation cancers resulting in defective homologous recombination. The predictive or prognostic value of BRCAness in HER2-negative breast cancer patients who have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is not fully elucidated.We retrospectively selected 101 high-risk HER2-negative patients diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer who underwent NAC treatment and evaluated BRCA1-like phenotype using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay. In an analysis of BRCAness, 95 out of 101 patients were analyzed.In total, 70 (74%) patients had sporadic-type tumors and 25 (26%) had BRCA1-like tumors according to pre-treatment samples. The BRCA1-like phenotype was not associated with pathological complete response (pCR) rate in the entire cohort. In survival analysis, pre-treatment BRCA1-like phenotype was not associated with survival. On the other hand, post-treatment BRCA1-like patients apparently showed shorter relapse-free survival (log-rank P\u2009=\u20090.016) and breast cancer-specific survival (P\u2009<\u20090.001) compared with sporadic features. In multivariate analysis, only the post-treatment BRCA1-phenotype was significant prognostic factors (HR 5.67, 95% CI 1.19-29.3). Furthermore, we found phenotype change between BRCA1-like and sporadic type through NAC in 19% of non-pCR patients. Post-treatment Ki67 significantly decreased in the persistent sporadic tumors during treatment or sporadic tumors changed after NAC (P\u2009<\u20090.0001, P\u2009=\u20090.0078, respectively).BRCAness may be useful biomarkers to predict prognosis for HER2-negative breast cancer refractory to standard chemotherapy. Our results pave the way for identifying patients who require alternative therapies.",
  "<b>BACKGROUND.</b> Background parenchymal uptake (BPU) on molecular breast imaging (MBI) was identified in a case-control study as a breast cancer risk factor beyond mammographic density. To our knowledge, this finding has not yet been confirmed in a cohort study. <b>OBJECTIVE.</b> The objectives of this study were to examine the association of BPU with breast cancer and to estimate the absolute risk and discriminatory accuracy of BPU in a cohort study. <b>METHODS.</b> A retrospective cohort was established that included women without a history of breast cancer who underwent MBI from 2004 to 2015. Radiologists who were blinded to future breast cancer diagnoses assessed BPU on baseline MBI examinations as low (photopenic or minimal) or elevated (mild, moderate, or marked). Associations of BPU with breast cancer were estimated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models of the time to diagnosis. The 5-year absolute risk was calculated for study subgroups. The discriminatory accuracy of BPU was also assessed. <b>RESULTS.</b> Among 2992 women (mean age, 56.3 years; SD, 10.6 years) who underwent MBI, breast cancer events occurred in 144 women (median follow-up, 7.3 years). Median time to diagnosis after MBI was 4.2 years (range, 0.5-11.6 years). Elevated BPU was associated with a greater breast cancer risk (hazard ratio [HR], 2.39; 95% CI, 1.68-3.41; <i>p</i> \u2264 .001). This association remained in postmenopausal women (HR, 3.50; 95% CI, 2.31-5.31; <i>p</i> < .001) but was not significant in premenopausal women (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.72-2.32; <i>p</i> = .39). The 5-year absolute risk of breast cancer was 4.3% (95% CI, 2.9-5.7%) for women with elevated BPU versus 2.5% (95% CI, 1.8-3.1%) for those with low BPU. Postmenopausal women with dense breasts and elevated BPU had a 5-year absolute risk of 8.1% (95% CI, 4.3-11.8%) versus 2.8% (1.8-3.8%) for those with low BPU. Among postmenopausal women, discriminatory accuracy for invasive cancer was improved with the addition of BPU versus use of the Gail risk score alone (C statistic, 65.1 vs 59.1; <i>p</i> = .04) or use of the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium risk score alone (C statistic, 66.4 vs 60.4; <i>p</i> = .04). <b>CONCLUSION.</b> BPU on MBI is an independent risk factor for breast cancer, with the strongest association observed among postmenopausal women with dense breasts. In postmenopausal women, BPU provides incremental discrimination in predicting breast cancer when combined with either the Gail model or the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium model. <b>CLINICAL IMPACT.</b> Observation of elevated BPU on MBI may identify a subset of women with dense breasts who would benefit most from supplemental screening or preventive options.",
  "The manuscript discusses landmark studies using abbreviated MRI for breast cancer screening. This includes abbreviated dynamic contrast enhanced MRI and diffusion weighted imaging. Our institutional experience with abbreviated MR protocol for breast cancer screening is also described.Abbreviated MRI protocols were found to demonstrate value for screening of breast cancer. It has been shown that abbreviated protocol MRI provides similar diagnostic sensitivities to full protocol MRI for breast cancer in women with increased lifetime risk. Our institutional abbreviated MRI protocol for breast cancer offers improved time and workflow efficiencies and has the potential to increase the number of breast cancers detected and the detection of pathologically relevant invasive breast cancer at earlier stages.",
  "<b>BACKGROUND</b> The average lifetime risk of breast cancer for an American woman is 12.5%, but individual risks vary significantly. Risk modeling is a standard of care for breast cancer screening and prevention with recommended tools to stratify individual risks based on age, family history, breast density, and a host of other known risk factors. Because of a lack of resources rurally, we have not consistently met this standard of care within all of North Carolina.<b>METHODS</b> We implemented a quality improvement project to assess the risk for breast cancer by gathering data on community risks. We implemented an evidence-based tool (Tyrer-Cuzick) for quantifying risk within a mostly rural population of Eastern North Carolina and developed customized services for women meeting elevated-risk definition. These services included additional imaging for elevated-risk women and a risk-reduction program. We also assessed genetic risks for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer in our at-risk population using National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines based on family history and added local genetics extenders to help test more women. We analyzed data regularly using Plan-Do-Study-Act methods to improve outcomes over 1 year.<b>RESULTS</b> We screened a population of 4500 women at a community hospital over a 1-year period for their individual lifetime cancer risk and genetic risk. Breast cancer risk was quantitated at the time of mammography, and women were stratified into 3 groups for risk management. Within our screening population, 6.3% of women were at high risk (defined by a lifetime breast cancer risk greater than or equal to 20%) and another 8.1% were above-average risk (defined by a lifetime breast cancer risk of 15%-20%). These women (14.4%) could potentially benefit from additional risk-management strategies. Additionally, 20% of all unaffected women within a typical screening population of Eastern North Carolina met NCCN guidelines for hereditary breast cancer and ovarian cancer testing independent of their cancer risk score. Using a model of targeted intervention within a population with elevated risks can be helpful in improving outcomes.<b>LIMITATIONS</b> This population within Eastern North Carolina is mostly rural and represents a potentially biased population, as it involves older women undergoing annual mammography. It may not be broadly applicable to the entire population based on age, geography, and other risks.<b>CONCLUSIONS</b> This model for improving cancer risk assessment and testing at a small community hospital in Eastern North Carolina was successful and addressed a community need. We discovered a high rate of increased-risk women who can benefit from individualized risk management, and a higher percentage of women who potentially benefit from genetic testing. These higher cumulative risks may in part explain some of the disparities seen for breast-cancer-specific outcomes in some parts of the state.",
  "Oestrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer is commonly treated using endocrine therapies such as aromatase inhibitors which block synthesis of oestradiol, but the influence of this therapy on the immune composition of breast tumours has not been fully explored. Previous findings suggest that tumour infiltrating lymphocytes and immune-related gene expression may be altered by treatment with aromatase inhibitors. However, whether these changes are a direct result of impacts on the host immune system or mediated through tumour cells is not known. We aimed to investigate the effect of oestrogen deprivation on the expression of chemokines and immune infiltration in vitro and in an ER+ immunocompetent mouse model.RT-qPCR and a bead-based Bioplex system were used to investigate the expression of chemokines in MCF-7 breast cancer cells deprived of oestrogen. A migration assay and flow cytometry were used to measure the migration of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to MCF-7 cells grown without the main biologically active oestrogen, oestradiol. Using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, we examined the immune cell infiltrate into tumours created by injecting SSM3 ER+ breast cancer cells into wild-type, immunocompetent 129/SvEv mice.This study demonstrates that oestrogen deprivation increases breast cancer secretion of TNF, CCL5, IL-6, IL-8, and CCL22 and alters total human peripheral blood mononuclear cell migration in an in vitro assay. Oestrogen deprivation of breast cancer cells increases migration of CD4+ T cells and decreases migration of CD11c+ and CD14+ PBMC towards cancer cells. PBMC migration towards breast cancer cells can be reduced by treatment with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin and celecoxib. Treatment with endocrine therapy using the aromatase inhibitor letrozole increases CD4+ T cell infiltration into ER+ breast cancer tumours in immune competent mice.These results suggest that anti-oestrogen treatment of ER+ breast cancer cells can alter cytokine production and immune cells in the area surrounding the cancer cells. These findings may have implications for the combination and timing of anti-oestrogen therapies with other therapies.",
  "Despite the current standard of care, breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality in women worldwide, thus emphasizing the need for better predictive and therapeutic targets. ABI1 is associated with poor survival and an aggressive breast cancer phenotype, although its role in tumorigenesis, metastasis, and the disease outcome remains to be elucidated. Here, we define the ABI1-based seven-gene prognostic signature that predicts survival of metastatic breast cancer patients; ABI1 is an essential component of the signature. Genetic disruption of Abi1 in primary breast cancer tumors of PyMT mice led to significant reduction of the number and size of lung metastases in a gene dose-dependent manner. The disruption of Abi1 resulted in deregulation of the WAVE complex at the mRNA and protein levels in mouse tumors. In conclusion, ABI1 is a prognostic metastatic biomarker in breast cancer. We demonstrate, for the first time, that lung metastasis is associated with an Abi1 gene dose and specific gene expression aberrations in primary breast cancer tumors. These results indicate that targeting ABI1 may provide a therapeutic advantage in breast cancer patients.",
  "To investigate the effect of the 8th American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) pathological prognostic staging on chemotherapy decision-making for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients with T1-2N0M0 disease.Patients diagnosed with T1-2N0M0 TNBC were retrieved from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. Statistical methods including Kaplan-Meier survival curve, receiver operating characteristics curve, and Cox proportional hazard model.We identified 12,156 patients, including 9371 (77.1%) patients who received chemotherapy. Overall, 57.4% of patients (n\u00a0=\u00a06975) were upstaged after being reassigned by the 8th AJCC staging. However, the 8th staging of AJCC did not have a greater prognostic value compared to the 7th staging (P\u00a0=\u00a00.064). The receipt of chemotherapy significantly improved the breast cancer-specific survival for stage T1c and T2 tumors (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), but not for stage T1a (P\u00a0=\u00a00.188) and T1b (P\u00a0=\u00a00.376) tumors. Using AJCC 8th staging, chemotherapy benefit was only found in stage IIA patients (P\u00a0=\u00a00.002), but not for stage IA (P\u00a0=\u00a00.653) and IB (P\u00a0=\u00a00.492) patients. There were 9564 patients with stage T1c and T2 diseases and 4979 patients with 8th AJCC stage IIA disease. Therefore, approximately half of patients (47.9%, n\u00a0=\u00a04585) may be safe to omit chemotherapy using the AJCC 8th staging compared to the current chemotherapy recommendation for T1-2N0M0 TNBC.The 8th AJCC staging system did not demonstrate the superior discriminatory ability of prognostic stratification than the 7th AJCC staging system in T1-2N0M0 TNBC. However, this new AJCC staging could more accurately predict the chemotherapy benefit, thereby enabling more patients to avoid unnecessary chemotherapy.",
  "Although sensitization of BRCA-mutated, homologous recombination (HR)-deficient breast cancer cells through PARP inhibitor is widely studied, not much is known about the treatment of BRCA-wild-type, HR-proficient breast cancer. Here, we aim to investigate whether a bioactive compound, Resveratrol (RES), can induce DNA double-strand breaks in HR-proficient breast cancer cells and Olaparib (OLA), a PARP inhibitor, can enhance the RES-mediated apoptosis by deregulating the HR repair pathway. The detailed mechanism of anti-cancer action of RES\u00a0+\u00a0OLA combination in breast cancer has been evaluated using in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo preclinical model systems. OLA increased RES-mediated DNA damage, downregulated the HR pathway proteins, caused a late S/G2 cell cycle arrest, enhanced apoptosis and cell death in RES pre-treated breast cancer cells at much lower concentrations than their individual treatments. Direct measurement of HR pathway activity using a GFP plasmid-based assay demonstrated reduced HR efficiency in I-SceI endonuclease-transfected cells treated with OLA. Moreover, RES\u00a0+\u00a0OLA treatment also caused significant reduction in PARP1-mediated PARylation and efficiently trapped PARP1 at the DNA damage site. Upon RES treatment, PARylated PARP1 was found to interact with BRCA1, which then activated other HR pathway proteins. But after addition of OLA in RES pre-treated cells, PARP1 could not interact with BRCA1 due to inhibition of PARylation. This resulted in deregulation of HR pathway. To further confirm the role of BRCA1 in PARP1-mediated HR pathway activation, BRCA1 was knocked down that caused complete inhibition of HR pathway activity, and further enhanced apoptosis after RES\u00a0+\u00a0OLA treatment in BRCA1-silenced cells. In agreement with in vitro data, similar experimental results were obtained in ex vivo patient-derived breast cancer cells and in vivo xenograft mice. Thus, RES\u00a0+\u00a0OLA combination treatment enhanced breast cancer cell death by causing excessive DNA damage and also simultaneously inhibiting the HR pathway.",
  "Adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) for breast cancer is associated with heart disease, although the impact of patient-specific factors on the interaction between cardiac risk and RT is not well-studied in cancer patients. The objective of this study is to compare acute coronary events (ACE) among the general population and women with breast cancer after adjuvant RT. Secondary analysis evaluated whether a healthy lifestyle could protect against RT-related cardiac toxicity.The National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening Cohort (2002-2013) was used to compare ACE risks among 1015 women with breast cancer and among 8120 women without cancer who were matched according to age, comorbidities, and smoking history. The risk of developing ACE over time while accounting for competing risks from other causes of death was analyzed.During 6.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.0 years of follow-up, the 5- and 10-year cumulative incidences of ACE were 5.5% and 11.3%, respectively. The breast cancer survivors who underwent breast radiotherapy and population-based matched sample had similar risks of ACE (hazard ratio: 0.94, 95% confidence interval: 0.69-1.28). However, in the sensitivity analysis, breast cancer survivors had increased risks of ACE if they did not exercise (hazard ratio 2.74, confidence interval: 1.27-5.91) or had a disability (hazard ratio 21.9, confidence interval: 2.50-191.6).In this matched cohort study, the cardiac risk after adjuvant RT increased with decreasing physical activity. The long-term effect of physical activity on ACE is uncertain, but these results can increase physicians' awareness of the approaches to increase exercise participation level among women undergoing RT for breast cancer. Confirmatory studies with individual doses of cardiac radiation and quantification of physical activity and sedentary time are required for validating our results.",
  "Obesity, exceptionally prevalent in the USA, promotes the incidence and progression of numerous cancer types including breast cancer. Complex, interacting metabolic and immune dysregulation marks the development of both breast cancer and obesity. Obesity promotes chronic low-grade inflammation, particularly in white adipose tissue, which drives immune dysfunction marked by increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production, alternative macrophage activation, and reduced T cell function. Breast tissue is predominantly composed of white adipose, and developing breast cancer readily and directly interacts with cells and signals from adipose remodeled by obesity. This review discusses the biological mechanisms through which obesity promotes breast cancer, the role of obesity in breast cancer health disparities, and dietary interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of obesity on breast cancer. We detail the intersection of obesity and breast cancer, with an emphasis on the shared and unique patterns of immune dysregulation in these disease processes. We have highlighted key areas of breast cancer biology exacerbated by obesity, including incidence, progression, and therapeutic response. We posit that interception of obesity-driven breast cancer will require interventions that limit protumor signaling from obese adipose tissue and that consider genetic, structural, and social determinants of the obesity-breast cancer link. Finally, we detail the evidence for various dietary interventions to offset obesity effects in clinical and preclinical studies of breast cancer. In light of the strong associations between obesity and breast cancer and the rising rates of obesity in many parts of the world, the development of effective, safe, well-tolerated, and equitable interventions to limit the burden of obesity on breast cancer are urgently needed.",
  "In breast cancer survivors, multiple risk factors for health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and chronic pain, including cancer treatment-related factors, psychosocial factors, and central sensitization (CS), have been suggested; however, there has been no comparative study between breast cancer survivors with and without pain. This study aimed to compare the demographic characteristics, psychological factors, and CS-related symptoms between breast cancer survivors with pain, those without pain, and healthy controls, and to investigate the relationships of these factors with HRQoL.We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 218 women, including patients who underwent breast cancer surgery and adjuvant therapy and healthy women.Patients were divided into the pain group (n\u2009=\u200942), without-pain group (n\u2009=\u200951), and healthy group (n\u2009=\u200947); thus, among breast cancer survivors, 45% reported chronic pain. The proportion of participants who received breast cancer treatments, such as axillary lymph node dissection and chemotherapy, was higher in the pain group than in the without-pain group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI) and psychosocial factors in the pain group were higher than those in the without-pain group and healthy group (p\u2009<\u20090.01). The CSI and PCS showed larger effect sizes than treatment-related factors. Moreover, HRQoL was significantly correlated with CSI, PCS, Patient Health Questionnaire-2, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 scale (all, p\u2009<\u20090.01). On multiple linear regression analysis, CSI accounted for 43% of the variance in HRQoL.CS and pain catastrophizing may be more associated with the development and/or maintenance of persistent pain than treatment-related factors.",
  "Breast cancer prevention is of great importance to reduce high incidence in South Africa. This study aimed to investigate adherence to the 2018 World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) Cancer Prevention Recommendations and the association with breast cancer risk in black urban women from Soweto, South Africa. A total of 396 breast cancer cases and 396 population-based controls from the South African Breast Cancer study (SABC) matched on age and demographic settings were included. Validated questionnaires were used to collect dietary and epidemiological data. To assess adherence to these recommendations, an eight-point adherence score was developed, using tertiles among controls for scoring each recommendation (0, 0\u00b75 and 1) with zero indicating the lowest adherence to the recommendations. OR and 95 % CI were estimated using multivariate logistic regression models to analyse associations between the WCRF/AICR score and breast cancer risk. Greater adherence (>4\u00b75 v. <3\u00b725) to the 2018 WCRF/AICR Cancer Prevention Recommendations was associated with a significant inverse association with breast cancer risk overall (OR = 0\u00b754, 95 % CI 0\u00b735, 0\u00b791) and specifically in postmenopausal women (OR = 0\u00b755, 95 % CI 0\u00b734, 0\u00b795), in cases with oestrogen positive and progesterone positive breast cancer subtypes (OR = 0\u00b754, 95 % CI 0\u00b739, 0\u00b789 and OR = 0\u00b768, 95 % CI 0\u00b743, 0\u00b789, respectively) and in obese women (OR = 0\u00b752, 95 % CI 0\u00b735, 0\u00b781). No significant association with breast cancer risk was observed in premenopausal women. Greater adherence to the 2018 WCRF/AICR Cancer Prevention Recommendations may reduce breast cancer risk in this black urban population of Soweto. Adherence thereof should be encouraged and form a part of cost-effective breast cancer prevention guidelines.",
  "Breast cancer during pregnancy (PrBC) is a rare tumor with only a little information on its immune landscape. Here, we sought to characterize the cellular composition of the tumor microenvironment (TME) of PrBC and identify its differences from early-onset breast cancer (EOBC) in non-pregnant women. A total of 83 PrBC and 89 EOBC were selected from our Institutional registry and subjected to tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) profiling and immunohistochemistry for CD4, CD8, forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) (clone 22C3). A significantly lower frequency of hormone receptor (HR)-positive tumors was observed in PrBC. The prevalence of low/null PD-L1 and CD8+TILs was higher in PrBC than in the controls, specifically in HR+/HER2- breast cancers. PrBC had a significantly higher risk of relapse and disease-related death, compared to EOBC. The presence of TILs and each TIL subpopulation were significantly associated with disease relapse. Moreover, the death rate was higher in PrBC with CD8+ TILs. The TME of PrBC is characterized by specific patterns of TIL subpopulations with significant biological and prognostic roles. Routine assessment of TILs and TILs subtyping in these patients would be a valid addition to the pathology report that might help identify clinically relevant subsets of women with PrBC.",
  "To analyze the prevalence of pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (P/LPVs) in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in the largest cohort of Slovenian male breast cancer (MBC) patients to date and to explore a possible correlation between the Slovenian founder variant BRCA2:c.7806-2A\u2009>\u2009G and predisposition to MBC.We performed a retrospective analysis of 81 MBC cases who underwent genetic counseling and/or testing between January 1999 and May 2020. To explore a possible genotype-phenotype correlation, we performed additional analyses of 203 unrelated families with P/LPVs in BRCA2 and 177 cases of female breast cancer (FBC) in carriers of P/LPVs in BRCA2.Detection rate of P/LPVs in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes was 24.7% (20/81) with 95% of them in BRCA2 gene. The only two recurrent P/LPVs were BRCA2:c.7806-2A\u2009>\u2009G and BRCA2:c.3975_3978dupTGCT (9 and 5 MBC cases, respectively). In families with BRCA2:c.7806-2A\u2009>\u2009G, the incidence of MBC cases was higher compared to families with other P/LPVs in BRCA2; however, the difference did not reach statistical significance (17.8% vs. 8.9%, p\u2009=\u20090.105). BRCA2:c.7806-2A\u2009>\u2009G was detected in both families with multiple cases of MBC. This splice-site variant represented a significantly higher proportion of all BRCA2 P/LPVs detected in MBC carriers compared to FBC carriers (47.4% vs. 26%, p\u2009=\u20090.049).We observed a high mutation detection rate and conclude this may be due to the prevalent BRCA2:c.7806-2A\u2009>\u2009G variant in Slovenia. Our results indicate a possible association between this variant and higher risk of breast cancer in males compared to other identified P/LPVs in BRCA2.",
  "Different clinicopathologic characteristics could contribute to inconsistent prognoses of small breast neoplasms (T1a/T1b). This study was done to conduct a retrospective analysis and establish a clinical prediction model to predict individual survival outcomes of patients with small carcinomas of the breast.Based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, eligible patients with small breast carcinomas were analyzed. Univariate analysis and multivariate analysis were performed to clarify the indicators of overall survival. Pooling risk factors enabled nomograms to be constructed and further predicted 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year survival of patients with small breast cancer. The model was internally validated for discrimination and calibration.A total of 17,543 patients with small breast neoplasms diagnosed between 2013 and 2016 were enrolled. Histologic grade, lymph node stage, estrogen receptor or progesterone receptor status, and molecular subtypes of breast cancer were regarded as the risk factors of prognosis in a Cox proportional hazards model (P\u00a0< .05). A nomogram was constructed to give predictive accuracy toward individual survival rate of patients with small breast neoplasms.This prognostic model provided a robust and effective method to predict the prognosis of patients with small breast cancer.",
  "As the second cause of cancer death in women, breast cancer has become a worldwide priority. Previous studies based on tumour cell lines demonstrated that arachidonic acid (AA) and its metabolites promote cancer development. However, recent studies based on the tumour microenvironment revealed the antitumour effect of AA metabolism. Therefore, it is essential to reevaluate and elucidate the effect of AA metabolism on breast cancer.Raw data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. The AA metabolic score of each sample, enrichment of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and immune infiltration were analysed by bioinformatics. Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression were performed to establish an AA metabolism prognostic signature. An AA metabolism related nomogram for predicting the survival probability of patients was built.AA metabolism was related to good prognosis in the TCGA-BRCA and METABRIC cohort. DEGs enrichment suggested that the upregulated DEGs of the high AA metabolism group were significantly enriched in immune-related pathways. The high AA metabolism group was infiltrated with more CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and activated NK cells. An AA metabolic signature (SPINK8, KLRB1, APOD and PIGR) was constructed for breast cancer prognosis.The study indicated that a high level of AA metabolism may be a biomarker for good prognosis in breast cancer, providing a possible explanation for the discouraging effect of cyclooxygenase inhibitors in cancer therapy. Moreover, a novel AA metabolic prognostic signature was constructed in the study, providing a novel strategy for breast cancer.",
  "Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and is the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide. Several factors increase the risk of breast cancer development, including patient characteristics, lifestyle habits, and predisposing genetic mutations. Once a diagnosis of breast cancer has been established, treatment decisions are guided by breast cancer stage and phenotype. Immunohistochemistry is used to quantify estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) expressions. In this chapter, we will focus on the management of localized and metastatic breast cancer, guided by the breast cancer hormone receptor status (ER and PR expression) and HER2 expression identified at diagnosis.",
  "Cancer patients have been reported to be at higher risk of COVID-19 complications and deaths. We report the characteristics and outcome of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 during breast cancer treatment at Institut Curie hospitals (ICH, Paris area, France).An IRB-approved prospective registry was set up at ICH on March 13, 2020, for all breast cancer patients with COVID-19 symptoms or radiologic signs. Registered data included patient history, tumor characteristics and treatments, COVID-19 symptoms, radiological features, and outcome. Data extraction was done on April 25, 2020. COVID-19 patients were defined as those with either a positive RNA test or typical, newly appeared lung CT scan abnormalities.Among 15,600 patients actively treated for early or metastatic breast cancer during the last 4\u2009months at ICH, 76 patients with suspected COVID-19 infection were included in the registry and followed. Fifty-nine of these patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 based on viral RNA testing (N\u2009=\u200941) or typical radiologic signs: 37/59 (63%) COVID-19 patients were treated for metastatic breast cancer, and 13/59 (22%) of them were taking corticosteroids daily. Common clinical features mostly consisted of fever and/or cough, while ground-glass opacities were the most common radiologic sign at diagnosis. We found no association between prior radiation therapy fields or extent of radiation therapy sequelae and extent of COVID-19 lung lesions. Twenty-eight of these 59 patients (47%) were hospitalized, and 6 (10%) were transferred to an intensive care unit. At the time of analysis, 45/59 (76%) patients were recovering or had been cured, 10/59 (17%) were still followed, and 4/59 (7%) had died from COVID-19. All 4 patients who died had significant non-cancer comorbidities. In univariate analysis, hypertension and age (>\u200970) were the two factors associated with a higher risk of intensive care unit admission and/or death.This prospective registry analysis suggests that the COVID-19 mortality rate in breast cancer patients depends more on comorbidities than prior radiation therapy or current anti-cancer treatment. Special attention must be paid to comorbidities when estimating the risk of severe COVID-19 in breast cancer patients.",
  "The Breast Cancer overall survival rate has raised impressively in the last 20 years mainly due to improved screening and effectiveness of treatments. This increase in survival paralleled the awareness over the long-lasting impact of the side effects of treatments on patient quality of life, emphasizing the motto \"a longer but better life for breast cancer patients\". In breast cancer more strikingly than in other cancers, besides the side effects of systemic treatments, there is the visible impact of surgery and radiotherapy on patients' body image. This has sparked interest on the development of tools for the aesthetic evaluation of Breast Cancer locoregional treatments, which evolved from manual, subjective approaches to computerized, automated solutions. However, although studied for almost four decades, past solutions were not mature enough to become a standard. Recent advancements in machine learning have inspired trends toward deep-learning-based medical image analysis, also bringing new promises to the field of aesthetic assessment of locoregional treatments. In this paper, a review and discussion of the previous state-of-the-art methods in the field is conducted and the extracted knowledge is used to understand the evolution and current challenges. The aim of this paper is to delve into the current opportunities as well as motivate and guide future research in the aesthetic assessment of Breast Cancer locoregional treatments.",
  "Breast cancer is a devastating malignancy, among which the luminal A (LumA) breast cancer is the most common subtype. In the present study, we used a comprehensive bioinformatics approach in the hope of identifying novel prognostic biomarkers for LumA breast cancer patients. Transcriptomic profiling of 611 LumA breast cancer patients was downloaded from TCGA database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between tumor samples and controls were first identified by differential expression analysis, before being used for the weighted gene co-expression network analysis. The subsequent univariate Cox regression and LASSO algorithm were used to uncover key prognostic genes for constructing multivariate Cox regression model. Patients were stratified into high-risk and low-risk groups according to the risk score, and subjected to multiple downstream analyses including survival analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), inference on immune cell infiltration and analysis of mutation burden. Receiving operator curve analysis was also performed. A total of 7071 DEGs were first identified by edgeR package, pink module was found significantly associated with invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). 105 prognostic genes and 9 predictors were identified, allowing the identification of a 5-key prognostic genes (LRRC77P, CA3, BAMBI, CABP1, ATP8A2) after intersection. These 5 genes, and the resulting Cox model, displayed good prognostic performance. Furthermore, distinct differences existed between two risk-score stratified groups at various levels. The identified 5-gene prognostic model will help deepen the understanding of the molecular and immunological mechanisms that affect the survival of LumA-ILC patients and guide and proper monitoring of these patients.",
  "Breast cancer (BC) is the second most common cancer in women, affecting 1 in 8 women in the United States (12.5%) in their lifetime. However, some women have a higher lifetime risk of BC because of genetic and lifestyle factors, mammographic breast density, and reproductive and hormonal factors. Because BC risk is variable, screening and prevention strategies should be individualized after considering patient-specific risk factors. Thus, health care professionals need to be able to assess risk profiles, identify high-risk women, and individualize screening and prevention strategies through a shared decision-making process. In this article, we review the risk factors for BC, risk-assessment models that identify high-risk patients, and preventive medications and lifestyle modifications that may decrease risk. We also discuss the benefits and limitations of various supplemental screening methods.",
  "<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the correlation of homocysteine (HCY) and coagulation function index with the risk of breast cancer and its clinicopathological characteristics. <b>Methods:</b> The HCY, coagulation function test index, and clinicopathological information of female breast cancer patients (333 cases) treated in Tianjin Medical University Cancer Hospital from January 2018 to December 2018 were collected, and female patients with benign breast (225 cases) were selected during the same period for the control group.

  "Improvements in the survival of patients with breast cancer, together with a better understanding of the pathology of the disease, have led to the emergence of bone health as a key aspect of patient management. Patients with breast cancer are typically at risk of skeletal complications throughout their disease course. The receptor activator of nuclear factor \u03ba B ligand (RANKL) inhibitor denosumab and bisphosphonates (e.g. zoledronic acid) are approved in Europe for the prevention of skeletal-related events (pathologic fracture, radiation or surgery to bone, and spinal cord compression) in adults with bone metastases secondary to solid tumours. These agents are also approved at lower doses for the treatment of patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis, a population largely overlapping with those in the early stages of breast cancer, and those with cancer treatment-induced bone loss, which is caused primarily by aromatase inhibitors. In this review, we consider the evidence supporting the use of therapeutic agents to protect bone health throughout the course of breast cancer. Timing of treatment initiation, dose and treatment duration may prove to be barriers to the optimization of the practical use of these agents in the management of patients with breast cancer. Furthermore, with longer survival times, patients may expect to receive long-term treatment with denosumab or bisphosphonates, therefore consideration must be given to safety. Thus, we aim to summarize the recommendations for the use of these agents in management of patients with breast cancer in Europe. We also discuss the recent evidence for their potential antineoplastic effects.",
  "Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women. Early detection of breast cancer can significantly improve the lives of millions of women across the globe. Given importance of finding solution/framework for early detection and diagnosis, recently many AI researchers are focusing to automate this task. The other reasons for surge in research activities in this direction are advent of robust AI algorithms (deep learning), availability of hardware that can run/train those robust and complex AI algorithms and accessibility of large enough dataset required for training AI algorithms. Different imaging modalities that have been exploited by researchers to automate the task of breast cancer detection are mammograms, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, histopathological images or any combination of them. This article analyzes these imaging modalities and presents their strengths and limitations. It also enlists resources from where their datasets can be accessed for research purpose. This article then summarizes AI and computer vision based state-of-the-art methods proposed in the last decade to detect breast cancer using various imaging modalities. Primarily, in this article we have focused on reviewing frameworks that have reported results using mammograms as it is the most widely used breast imaging modality that serves as the first test that medical practitioners usually prescribe for the detection of breast cancer. Another reason for focusing on mammogram imaging modalities is the availability of its labelled datasets. Datasets availability is one of the most important aspects for the development of AI based frameworks as such algorithms are data hungry and generally quality of dataset affects performance of AI based algorithms. In a nutshell, this research article will act as a primary resource for the research community working in the field of automated breast imaging analysis.",
  "This study aimed to evaluate the awareness and practice of breast self-examination (BSE) and the awareness of screening and risk factors for breast cancer among patients from a mastology clinic and to associate such findings with sociodemographic factors of that population. A total of 202 randomly selected patients from the outpatient clinic of the Mastology Unit of S\u00e3o Paulo School of Medicine were interviewed. A structured questionnaire was used and included questions regarding sociodemographic variables, questions to assess the knowledge and practice of BSE, and knowledge of mammographic screening and risk factors for breast cancer. The vast majority of patients were aware of the existence of BSE (93.1%). BSE was performed by most patients (64.9%), although only 20.3% performed it adequately. Only 21.8% of respondents showed awareness of the best screening method for breast cancer. Furthermore, 17.3% of patients showed adequate awareness of risk factors for breast cancer. The analysis of sociodemographic variables showed that older, postmenopausal, and less-educated women showed better practice of BSE. Overall, the patients had no adequate awareness of BSE, mammographic screening, and risk factors for breast cancer, and the majority failed to practice BSE adequately, particularly the group of patients with the higher level of education. These data show that educational measures regarding the practice of BSE and, especially, mammograms should be emphasized, regardless of education level or family income of the patient.",
  "Assessing the combined effect of mammographic density and benign breast disease is of utmost importance to design personalized screening strategies.We analyzed individual-level data from 294,943 women aged 50-69 years with at least one mammographic screening participation in any of four areas of the Spanish Breast Cancer Screening Program from 1995 to 2015, and followed up until 2017. We used partly conditional Cox models to assess the association between benign breast disease, breast density, and the risk of breast cancer.During a median follow-up of 8.0 years, 3697 (1.25%) women had a breast cancer diagnosis and 5941 (2.01%) had a benign breast disease. More than half of screened women had scattered fibroglandular density (55.0%). The risk of breast cancer independently increased with the presence of benign breast disease and with the increase in breast density (p for interaction = 0.84). Women with benign breast disease and extremely dense breasts had a threefold elevated risk of breast cancer compared with those with scattered fibroglandular density and without benign breast disease (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.07; 95%CI = 2.01-4.68). Heterogeneous density and benign breast disease was associated with nearly a 2.5 elevated risk (HR = 2.48; 95%CI = 1.66-3.70). Those with extremely dense breast without a benign breast disease had a 2.27 increased risk (95%CI = 2.07-2.49).Women with benign breast disease had an elevated risk for over 15 years independently of their breast density category. Women with benign breast disease and dense breasts are at high risk for future breast cancer.\u2022 Benign breast disease and breast density were independently associated with breast cancer. \u2022 Women with benign breast disease had an elevated risk for up to 15 years independently of their mammographic density category.",
  "To compare the risk of developing lung cancer between patients with breast cancer and the general population and explore the risk factors for the development of primary lung cancer after treatment for breast cancer.The PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases were searched from the establishment date to October 11, 2020. Two separate meta-analyses were performed: one focused on studies reporting the risk of subsequent lung cancer after breast cancer and one focused on studies exploring the risk factors for subsequent lung cancer in patients with breast cancer. The standardized incidence ratios with 95% confidence intervals were combined to compare the risk of developing lung cancer between patients with breast cancer and the general population. The relative risks (RRs) or ORs with 95% confidence intervals were combined to assess the association of clinicopathological parameters with the risk of developing lung cancer after breast cancer. All statistical analyses were conducted by STATA 12.0.A total of 15 studies involving 1,161,979 patients were eventually included in the first meta-analysis, and the pooled results indicated that female patients with breast cancer revealed a significantly higher risk of developing subsequent lung cancer (standardized incidence ratio\u00a0= 1.25, p < 0.001). In addition, a total of 22 articles involving 3,090,620 patients were included in the second meta-analysis. The pooled results indicated that smoking (OR\u00a0= 9.73, p < 0.001) and radiotherapy (RR\u00a0= 1.40, p < 0.001) were risk factors for developing subsequent lung cancer in patients with breast cancer, and chemotherapy (RR\u00a0= 0.69, p\u00a0= 0.002), positive estrogen receptor status (RR\u00a0= 0.93, p\u00a0= 0.014) and positive progesterone receptor status (RR\u00a0= 0.86, p < 0.001) were protective factors. Meanwhile, subgroup analysis based on the relative position of the breast and lung cancers (ipsilateral versus contralateral) was conducted, which indicated that radiotherapy only increased the risk of ipsilateral lung cancer in patients with breast cancer (RR\u00a0= 1.27, p\u00a0= 0.001).Patients with breast cancer are more likely to develop lung cancer than the general population, and the risk of developing primary lung cancer after breast cancer is affected by smoking, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, estrogen receptor status and progesterone receptor status.",
  "Patients diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer have poor outcome with a median survival of approximately 2\u00a0years. While novel therapeutic options are urgently needed, the great majority of breast cancer research has focused on the primary tumor and less is known about metastatic breast cancer and the prognostic impact of the metastatic tumor microenvironment. Here we investigate the immune landscape in unique clinical material. We explore how the immune landscape changes with metastatic progression and elucidate the prognostic role of immune cells infiltrating primary tumors and corresponding lymph node and more importantly distant metastases.Immunohistochemical staining was performed on human breast cancer tissue microarrays from primary tumors (n\u00a0=\u2009231), lymph node metastases (n\u00a0=\u2009129), and distant metastases (n\u00a0=\u200943). Infiltration levels of T lymphocytes (CD3<sup>+</sup>), regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs, FOXP3<sup>+</sup>), macrophages (CD68<sup>+</sup>), and neutrophils (NE<sup>+</sup>) were assessed in primary tumors. T lymphocytes and Tregs were further investigated in lymph node and distant metastases.T lymphocyte and Treg infiltration were the most clinically important immune cell populations in primary tumors. Infiltration of T lymphocytes and Tregs in primary tumors correlated with proliferation (P\u2009=\u20090.007, P\u2009=\u20090.000) and estrogen receptor negativity (P\u2009=\u20090.046, P\u2009=\u20090.026). While both T lymphocyte and Treg infiltration had a negative correlation to luminal A subtype (P\u2009=\u20090.031, P\u2009=\u20090.000), only Treg infiltration correlated to luminal B (P\u2009=\u20090.034) and triple-negative subtype (P\u2009=\u20090.019). In primary tumors, infiltration of T lymphocytes was an independent prognostic factor for recurrence-free survival (HR\u2009=\u20091.77, CI\u2009=\u20091.01-3.13, P\u2009=\u20090.048), while Treg infiltration was an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer-specific survival (HR\u2009=\u20091.72, CI\u2009=\u20091.14-2.59, P\u2009=\u20090.01). Moreover, breast cancer patients with Treg infiltration in their distant metastases had poor post-recurrence survival (P\u2009=\u20090.039). Treg infiltration levels changed with metastatic tumor progression in 50% of the patients, but there was no significant trend toward neither lower nor higher infiltration.Treg infiltration could have clinical applicability as a prognostic biomarker, deciphering metastatic breast cancer patients with worse prognosis, and accordingly, could be a suitable immunotherapeutic target for patients with metastatic breast cancer. Importantly, half of the patients had changes in Treg infiltration during the course of metastatic progression emphasizing the need to characterize the metastatic immune landscape.",
  "American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) clinical staging is used to estimate breast cancer prognosis, but individual patient survival within each stage varies considerably by age at diagnosis. We hypothesized that the addition of age at diagnosis to the staging schema will enable more refined risk stratification.We performed a retrospective population analysis of adult women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 2010 and 2015 registered in SEER. Multivariable Cox hazards models were used to evaluate the association of AJCC 8th edition clinical prognostic stage (CPS) and age with risk of overall mortality. Separate hierarchical models were fit to the data: Model 1: CPS alone; Model 2: CPS\u2009+\u2009age\u2009+\u2009age<sup>2</sup>; and Model 3: CPS\u2009+\u2009age\u2009+\u2009age<sup>2</sup>\u2009+\u2009CPS x age\u2009+\u2009CPS x age<sup>2</sup>. Models were compared by the Akaike information criterion (AIC), the c-statistic for time-dependent receiver operator characteristic curves, and category-free net reclassification improvement (NRI). Internal validation was performed using bootstrapping samples.Among 86,637 women, the median follow-up was 36\u00a0months and 3-year overall survival was 91.9%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1%. Age significantly modified the effect of CPS on survival (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Model 3 was the most precise, with the lowest AIC (126,619.63), the highest c-statistic (0.8212, standard error 0.0187), and superior NRI indices.Age at diagnosis is a highly prognostic variable that warrants consideration for inclusion in future editions of the AJCC Breast Cancer Staging Manual.",
  "This review gives an overview of the current state of deep learning research in breast cancer imaging. Breast imaging plays a major role in detecting breast cancer at an earlier stage, as well as monitoring and evaluating breast cancer during treatment. The most commonly used modalities for breast imaging are digital mammography, digital breast tomosynthesis, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Nuclear medicine imaging techniques are used for detection and classification of axillary lymph nodes and distant staging in breast cancer imaging. All of these techniques are currently digitized, enabling the possibility to implement deep learning (DL), a subset of Artificial intelligence, in breast imaging. DL is nowadays embedded in a plethora of different tasks, such as lesion classification and segmentation, image reconstruction and generation, cancer risk prediction, and prediction and assessment of therapy response. Studies show similar and even better performances of DL algorithms compared to radiologists, although it is clear that large trials are needed, especially for ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, to exactly determine the added value of DL in breast cancer imaging. Studies on DL in nuclear medicine techniques are only sparsely available and further research is mandatory. Legal and ethical issues need to be considered before the role of DL can expand to its full potential in clinical breast care practice.",
  "Retrospective analysis of nightly fasting among women with breast cancer suggests that fasting <\u200913\u00a0h may be associated with a higher risk of breast cancer recurrence. We sought to evaluate prolonged overnight fasting (POF), an accessible nonpharmacological intervention, in a prospective feasibility study.We designed a single-arm, pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of fasting for 13\u00a0h overnight for 12\u00a0weeks among women with a history of early-stage breast cancer survivors. Baseline and end of study assessments included measurements of body mass index (BMI), blood biomarkers, quality of life (QOL), mood, fatigue, and physical activity. Patient-reported outcome questionnaires were also administered at 6\u00a0weeks. Feasibility was defined as \u2265\u200960% of participants documenting fasting for 13\u00a0h on at least 70% of nights during the study period.Forty women with a history of breast cancer were enrolled with a median age of 60 (range 35-76) and median time since diagnosis of 4.5\u00a0years (range 0.8-20.7). At baseline, BMI was \u2265\u200925 in 37.5%. Ninety-five percent of participants fasted \u2265\u200913\u00a0h for at least 70% of study days (95% CI 83-99%). There was a statistically significant improvement in anxiety (p\u2009=\u20090.0007) at 6\u00a0weeks and BMI (p\u2009=\u20090.0072), anxiety (p\u2009=\u20090.0141), depression (p\u2009=\u20090.0048), and fatigue (p\u2009=\u20090.0105) at 12\u00a0weeks. There was no significant change in overall QOL, physical activity levels, or blood biomarkers at 12\u00a0weeks.POF is feasible among patients with a history of breast cancer and may potentially improve BMI, mood, and fatigue without detrimental effects on overall QOL.",
  "Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and 2-11% of the cases are bilateral. Bilateral breast cancer frequently emerges as a second primary cancer. Lymphoma and mucinous carcinoma of breast are very rare. Here we present a case, of bilateral breast cancer with metachronous lymphoma and mucinous carcinoma.57-year old female had received chemotherapy and radiotherapy for stage IA Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) located in right breast. At 14th month of her breast DLBCL diagnosis, a diagnosis of mucinous carcinoma was determined in her left breast. After surgery, adjuvant anastrozole was initiated. The patient is still in follow-up with remission at her sixth year of DLBCL diagnosis and fifth year of mucinous carcinoma diagnosis.The evaluation of unilateral breast cancer patients in terms of bilateral breast cancer occurrence risk has become important.",
  "Bean intake has been associated with reduced risk of breast cancer, however; only a few studies considered molecular subtypes status and none in African women living in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the associations between dietary intake of beans and\u00a0breast cancer including its subtypes in Nigerian women.Overall, 472 newly diagnosed patients with primary invasive breast cancer were age-matched (\u00b1\u20095\u00a0years) with 472 controls from the Nigerian Integrative Epidemiology of Breast Cancer (NIBBLE) Study from 01/2014 to 07/2016. We collected the dietary intake of beans using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Beans_alone intake was categorized into three levels never (never in the past year), low (\u2264\u20091 portion/week), and high intake (>\u20091 portion/week). We used conditional and unconditional logistic regression models to estimate the Odds Ratio (OR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) of beans_alone intake and the risk of\u00a0breast cancer and by its molecular subtypes, respectively.The mean (SD) age of cases was 44.4(10.0) and of controls was 43.5(9.5) years. In the case group, more than half (51.1%) have never consumed beans_alone in the past year compared to 39.0% in the control group. The multivariable models showed inverse associations between beans_alone (high vs. none) and breast cancer (OR\u2009=\u20090.55; 95%CI: 0.36-0.86, p-trend\u2009=\u20090.03), triple-negative (OR\u2009=\u20090.51 95%CI: 0.28-0.95, p-trend\u2009=\u20090.02)\u00a0and marginally associated with hormone receptor-positive (OR\u2009=\u20090.53, 95%CI: 0.29-0.96, p-trend\u2009=\u20090.06).Dietary intake of beans_alone may play a significant role in reducing the incidence of breast cancer, particularly of the more aggressive molecular subtype, triple-negative, in African women living in SSA.",
  "The side effects of systemic cancer therapy and the lack of clinical data on safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination in cancer patients cause uncertainty among the patients about whether to get vaccinated or not. Here, we evaluated attitude towards and effects of COVID-19 vaccination in patients with breast and gynecological cancer undergoing systemic cancer therapy.Since March 15th, 2021, cancer patients who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines were routinely interviewed about immediate and late side effects. Clinical parameters such as current therapy, time interval between therapy administration and vaccination, and changes in the therapy schedule due to vaccination were documented. The collected data were analyzed de-identified as a part of routine quality assurance.By July 27th, 2021, 218 patients (74.3% breast cancer patients) had received one of two COVID-19 vaccine doses, and 112 patients had received both doses: 77.5% received Conmirnaty (BioNTech/Pfizer), 16.1% Vaxzevria (Astra Zeneca) and 5.9% COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna. The COVID-19 vaccines had an acceptable safety profile with self-limiting local and systemic adverse events, which rarely lasted >48\u00a0h post vaccination. Symptoms occurred predominantly after the second dose of the vaccine and less frequently in older patients >55 years. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported, and only limited effects of vaccination on the therapy schedule were observed.Breast and gynecologic cancer patients tolerate the COVID-19 vaccination while undergoing systemic cancer therapy without any additional side effects beyond those reported in the general population.",
  "Metastasis of cancer cells to the brain occurs frequently in patients with certain subtypes of breast cancer. In particular, patients with HER2-positive or triple-negative breast cancer are at high risk for the development of brain metastases. Despite recent advances in the treatment of primary breast tumors, the prognosis of breast cancer patients with brain metastases remains poor. A better understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying brain metastasis might be expected to lead to improvements in the overall survival rate for these patients. Recent studies have revealed complex interactions between metastatic cancer cells and their microenvironment in the brain. Such interactions result in the activation of various signaling pathways related to metastasis in both cancer cells and cells of the microenvironment including astrocytes and microglia. In this review, we focus on such interactions and on their role both in the metastatic process and as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.",
  "HMGB1 is a member of highly conserved high mobility group protein superfamily with intracellular and extracellular distribution. Abnormal HMGB1 levels are frequently manifested in various malignant diseases, including breast cancer. Numerous studies have revealed the clinical value of HMGB1 in the diagnosis and therapy of breast cancer. However, the dual function of pro- and anti-tumor makes HMGB1 in cancer progression requires more profound understanding. This review summarizes the functions and mechanisms of HMGB1 on regulating breast cancer, including autophagy, immunogenic cell death, and interaction with the tumor microenvironment. These functions determine the strategies for the development of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy and combination therapies by targeting HMGB1 in breast cancer. Defining the mechanisms of HMGB1 on regulating breast cancer development and progression will facilitate the application of HMGB1 as a therapeutic target for breast cancer.",
  "Soy contains genistein and daidzein isoflavones. Isoflavones are phytoestrogens, with a similarity in structure to human 17-\u03b2 estradiol hormone. They imitate the action of estrogen on organs by binding and activating estrogen receptors. Numerous studies have examined the relationship between soy consumption and breast cancer but not the amount of consumption itself. We performed a systematic review of the literature in order to determine whether the amount of soy and isoflavones consumed has a positive effect in pre- and post-menopausal women.Data gathering was performed following PRISMA guidelines. Narrowing down the result set for all relevant data was performed via title, abstract, full-text evaluation and the snowball procedure. The selected articles had all relevant data extracted. Analysis of the data was performed using Cochrane's Review Manager statistical analysis tool in order to draw conclusions regarding the positive effect for the amount of soy and isoflavones consumed.Significant results were found when statistically analyzing data from prospective studies which compared soy isoflavones consumption, breast cancer risk and occurrence. The data were indicative of a clear inverse correlation between the amount of isoflavones consumed and breast cancer occurrence in pre- and post-menopausal women.The consumption of soy isoflavones can reduce the risk of breast cancer in pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women.",
  "To analyse the disease-free survival and overall survival in older adults with breast cancer after breast-conserving therapy, focusing on the relevance of non-breast malignancy (NBM) with respect to survival rates.Analyses were based on 1205 women aged 65 years and older with breast cancer treated with breast-conserving therapy between 1999 and 2015. Patients were divided into three age categories: 65-70, 71-75 and >75 years. Multivariate survival analysis was carried out using Cox regression analysis.The two youngest age categories showed excellent results, with a 12-year disease-free survival of 84.6 and 86.3%, respectively. We noted a 17.2% incidence of NBM, particularly for colon cancer and lung cancer. Most (72.9%) occurred after a diagnosis of breast cancer. Of those 72.9%, about 50% died as a result of NBM within 2 years of the diagnosis of NBM. The overall 12-year NBM-specific survival was 92.0%. The 12-year overall survival was 60.0% for all and for the three abovementioned age categories was 73.3, 54.4 and 28.4%, respectively. The cause of death for all was predominantly non-malignancy-related morbidity.The impact of breast cancer on life expectancy was limited, in particularly for women aged 65-75 years. The relevance of NBM on survival was limited.",
  "Male breast cancer (MBC) is rare, representing <1% of all breast cancers. Treatment recommendations have been extrapolated from trial data of female breast cancer patients. This study aims to report our institutional experience of MBC across a 20\u2009year period, analyse the survival outcome and prognosis of this group against female breast cancer patients treated at the same centre.Clinical, histopathological, treatment and survival data of male and female breast cancer patients treated between Jan 1999 and July 2019 at Singapore General Hospital and National Cancer Centre Singapore were identified and analysed.Fifty-seven male patients were identified. The median age at diagnosis was 63\u2009years. Majority had invasive ductal carcinoma (86%) and presented at an early disease stage: 70.2% presented as Tis/T1/T2 and 49.1% had no axillary nodal involvement. 84.2% had a simple mastectomy with either a sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary clearance. The median follow up was 5.69\u2009years for males and 5.83\u2009years for females. The median survival was 11.86\u2009years for males and 16.3\u2009years for females. At 5\u2009years, overall survival (OS) was 69.9% (52.3-82.1%) and disease free survival (DFS) was 62.9% (44.9-76.5%) for males compared with OS 83.8% (83.21-84.39%) and DFS 74.5% (73.91-75.09%) for females.MBC remains understudied. Our institutional data indicates that good long term survival in South-East Asian patients can be achieved with treatment protocols that are similar to female breast cancer. More prospective studies are required.",
  "There are racial/ethnic differences in the incidence of hormone receptor positive and negative breast cancer. To understand why these differences exist, we investigated associations between hormone-related factors and breast cancer risk by race/ethnicity in the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) Study. Among 81\u2009511 MEC participants (Native Hawaiian, Japanese American, Latina, African American and White women), 3806 estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and 828 ER- incident invasive breast cancers were diagnosed during a median of 21\u2009years of follow-up. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to calculate associations between race/ethnicity and breast cancer risk, and associations between hormone-related factors and breast cancer risk by race/ethnicity. Relative to White women, ER+ breast cancer risk was higher in Native Hawaiians and lower in Latinas and African Americans; ER- disease risk was higher in African Americans. We observed interaction with race/ethnicity in associations between oral contraceptive use (OC; P<sub>int</sub> .03) and body mass index (BMI; P<sub>int</sub> .05) with ER+ disease risk; ever versus never OC use increased risk only in Latinas and positive associations for obese versus lean BMI were strongest in Japanese Americans. For ER- disease risk, associations for OC use, particularly duration of use, were strongest for African Americans (P<sub>int</sub> .04). Our study shows that associations of OC use and obesity with ER+ and ER- breast cancer risk differ by race/ethnicity, but established risk factors do not fully explain racial/ethnic differences in risk. Further studies are needed to identify factors to explain observed racial/ethnic differences in breast cancer incidence.",
  "Reproductive and hormonal factors may influence breast cancer risk via endogenous estrogen exposure. Cumulative menstrual months (CMM) can be used as a surrogate measure of this exposure. Using harmonized data from four population-based breast cancer studies (7284 cases and 7242 controls), we examined ethnicity-specific associations between CMM and breast cancer risk using logistic regression, adjusting for menopausal status and other risk factors. Higher CMM was associated with increased breast cancer risk in non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanics and Asian Americans regardless of menopausal status (all FDR adjusted P trends\u00a0=\u00a0.0004), but not in African Americans. In premenopausal African Americans, there was a suggestive trend of lower risk with higher CMM. Stratification by body mass index (BMI) among premenopausal African American women showed a nonsignificant positive association with CMM in nonobese (BMI <30\u2009kg/m<sup>2</sup> ) women and a significant inverse association in obese women (OR per 50 CMM\u00a0=\u00a00.56, 95% CI 0.37-0.87, P<sub>trend</sub> \u00a0=\u00a0.03). Risk patterns were similar for hormone receptor positive (HR+; ER+ or PR+) breast cancer; a positive association was found in all premenopausal and postmenopausal ethnic groups except in African Americans. HR- (ER- and PR-) breast cancer was not associated with CMM in all groups combined, except for a suggestive positive association among premenopausal Asian Americans (OR per 50 CMM\u00a0=\u00a01.33, P\u00a0=\u00a0.07). In summary, these results add to the accumulating evidence that established reproductive and hormonal factors impact breast cancer risk differently in African American women compared to other ethnic groups, and also differently for HR- breast cancer than HR+ breast cancer.",
  "Chronic stress and related hormones are key in cancer progression. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) and its agonists was reported that inducing anti-tumor effect. However, the function of PPAR\u03b3 in pro-tumorigenic effects induced by chronic stress in breast cancer remains unknown. Herein, we have characterized a novel role of PPAR\u03b3 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) signals in breast cancer promoted by chronic stress.We performed experiments in vivo and in vitro and used bioinformatics data to evaluate the therapeutic potential of PPAR\u03b3 in breast cancer promoted by stress.Chronic stress significantly inhibited the PPAR\u03b3 expression and promoted breast cancer in vivo. VEGF/FGF2-mediated angiogenesis increased in the chronic stress group compared to the control group. PPAR\u03b3 agonist pioglitazone (PioG) injection offset the pro-tumorigenic effect of chronic stress. Moreover, specific \u03b22-adrenergic receptor (\u03b22R) antagonist ICI11-8551 inhibited the effect of chronic stress. In vitro, norepinephrine (NE) treatment had a similar tendency to chronic stress. The effect of NE was mediated by the \u03b22R/adenylate cyclase signaling pathway and suppressed by PioG. PPAR\u03b3 suppressed VEGF/FGF2 through reactive oxygen species inhibition. Bioinformatics data confirmed that therewas a lowPPAR\u03b3 expression in breast invasive carcinoma. Lower PPAR\u03b3 was associated with a significantly worse survival.\u03b22R activation induced by chronic stress and related hormones promotes growth and VEGF/FGF2-mediated angiogenesis of breast cancer by down-regulating PPAR\u03b3. Our findings hint that \u03b2 receptor and PPAR\u03b3 as two target molecules and the novel role for their agonists or antagonists as clinical medicine in breast cancer therapy.",
  "It has been proposed that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play crucial roles in the initiation and progression of various cancers including breast cancer. Our study aimed to determine the function and regulatory mechanism of hsa_circ_0000517 in breast cancer. qRT-PCR was applied to determine hsa_circ_0000517 expression in breast cancer cells. The circular structure of hsa_circ_0000517 was confirmed using RNase R digestion assay. The subcellular distribution of hsa_circ_0000517 was analyzed using nuclear mass separation assay. Effects of hsa_circ_0000517 on the malignant behaviors of breast cancer cells were determined using CCK-8, colony formation assay, flow cytometry analysis, caspase-3 activity assay, and Transwell invasion assay. Bioinformatics analysis, luciferase reporter assay, and RIP were used to predict and confirm the interaction between hsa_circ_0000517 and miR-326. Bioinformatics analysis was used to search the possible targets of miR-326. Hsa_circ_0000517 was upregulated in breast cancer tissues and cells. Hsa_circ_0000517 was a stable circularized transcript that was preferentially distributed in the cytoplasm. Hsa_circ_0000517 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation ability, and invasion and triggered apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Hsa_circ_0000517 acted as a sponge of miR-326 to suppress its expression. miR-326 inhibition abolished the effects of hsa_circ_0000517 knockdown on the malignant behaviors of breast cancer cells. Totally 17 genes were identified as the potential targets of miR-326 in breast cancer. In conclusion, hsa_circ_0000517 silencing repressed breast cancer progression by upregulating miR-326 expression.",
  "Treatment advances for metastatic breast cancer (mBC) have improved overall survival (OS) in some mBC subtypes; however, there remains no cure for mBC. Considering the use of progression-free survival (PFS) and other surrogate endpoints in clinical trials, we must understand patient perspectives on measures used to assess treatment efficacy.To explore global patient perceptions of the concept of PFS and its potential relation to quality of life (QoL).Virtual roundtables in Europe and the United States and interviews in Japan with breast cancer patients, patient advocates, and thought leaders. Discussions were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed thematically.Lengthened OS combined with no worsening or improvement in QoL remain the most important endpoints for mBC patients. Time when the disease is not progressing is meaningful to patients when coupled with improvements in QoL and no added treatment toxicity. Clinical terminology such as \"PFS\" is not well understood, and participants underscored the need for patient-friendly terminology to better illustrate the concept. Facets of care that patients with mBC value and that may be related to PFS include relief from cancer-related symptoms and treatment-related toxicities as well as the ability to pursue personal goals. Improved communication between patients and providers on managing treatment-related toxicities and addressing psychosocial challenges to maintain desired QoL is needed.While OS and QoL are considered the most relevant endpoints, patients also value periods of time without disease progression. Incorporation of these considerations into the design and conduct of future clinical trials in mBC, as well as HTA and reimbursement decision-making, is needed to better capture the potential value of a therapeutic innovation.",
  "Recurrence and metastasis affect the survival rate of breast cancer patients. The fundamental reason lies in the lack of understanding of the mechanism of breast cancer metastasis. In this study, the proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of breast cancer cells were evaluated. The mechanism of NUPR1/TFE3 signaling pathway on autophagy-related proteins and migration-invasion-related proteins was examined in cell model in vitro. The effects of NUPR1 on malignancy formation and metastasis were investigated in vivo. We found that NUPR1 was upregulated in breast cancer cells and tissues. NUPR1 knockdown inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of ZR-75-30\u00a0cells and inhibited malignancy formation and metastasis in vivo. Mechanically, NUPR1 promoted autophagy by activating of TFE3 transcription, thereby regulating breast cancer metastasis. This paper indicates that NUPR1 activates autophagy through the TFE3 signaling pathway to promote breast cancer metastasis, and provides a biological basis for the intervention of blocking distant metastasis.",
  "The incidence of male breast cancer (MBC), although rare, has shown an increase. However, the current epidemiology of and practice patterns for MBC remain unclear. This study evaluated the characteristics and care patterns for MBC compared with female breast cancer (FBC) in Japan.Using the National Database of Hospital-Based Cancer Registries (HBCR) linked to the Diagnosis Procedure Combination data, we analyzed newly diagnosed breast cancer cases between January 2012 and December 2015 at participating hospitals in a large quality-of-care monitoring project. We employed logistic regression models to assess cancer treatment differences between MBC and FBC in patients who were indicated for adjuvant radiation therapy and neo-adjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy.Of 142,636 breast cancer patients, 870 (0.61%) were MBC patients. At diagnosis, the mean age of MBC patients was 10\u00a0years older than FBC patients (70 vs 60\u00a0years; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Advanced-stage cancer was more frequently observed in MBC than in FBC (stage III/IV 18.9%/6.1% vs 10.6%/5.2%). Despite this, MBC patients were less likely to receive adjuvant radiation therapy and neo-adjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy. Gender was an independent treatment determinant factor for chemotherapy decisions.MBC patients were older and had higher stages of cancer than FBC patients at diagnosis, but received suboptimal treatment.",
  "Whether breast volume is a risk factor for breast cancer is controversial. This study aimed to evaluate whether a significant association between breast volume and risk of breast cancer, based on linear measurements, was present by applying propensity score matching (PSM).The study was designed as a hospital-based case-control study. Between March 2018 and May 2019, 208 cases and 340 controls were retrospectively reviewed. Information on menarche, smoking, feeding mode, oral contraceptives, reproductive history and family history was obtained through a structured questionnaire. Breast volume was calculated using a formula based on linear measurements of breast parameters. Cox regression and PSM were used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for breast cancer using risk factors adjusted for potential confounders.There was a significant difference in breast volume between the two groups before propensity score matching (P\u2009=\u20090.014). Binary logistic regression showed that the risk of breast cancer was slightly higher in the case group with larger breast volumes than in the control group(P\u2009=\u20090.009, OR\u2009=\u20091.002, 95%CI:1.000\u2009~\u20091.003). However, there was no significant statistical difference between the two groups using an independent sample Mann-Whitney U test (P\u2009=\u20090.438) or conditional logistic regression (P\u2009=\u20090.446).After PSM for potential confounding factors, there is no significant difference in breast volume estimated by BREAST-V formula between the case group and the control group. The risk of breast cancer may not be related to breast volume in Chinese women.",
  "Regional nodal irradiation (RNI) improves disease outcome in breast cancer patients, but the contribution of internal mammary node irradiation (IMNI) in the context of modern systemic treatment is still controversial. The aim of our study is to evaluate the effect of IMNI in patients with modern systemic treatment in real-world setting.We retrospectively analyzed patients with primary breast cancer treated with surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant chestwall/breast irradiation and RNI from 5/2007-12/2010. RNI was delivered to the ipsilateral supraclavicular region and infraclavicular region\u2009+\u2009/\u2009-\u2009IMNs. We separated two groups based on the presence and the absence of IMNI. The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS). DFS and overall survival (OS) were evaluated with Kaplan-Meier method. Differences between two groups were compared with the log-rank test (p\u2009<\u20090.05 considered significant). We used two methods to account for potential confounders: propensity score matching (PSM) and Cox regression analysis.We analyzed 872 patients who received RNI with IMNI (n\u2009=\u2009390) or without IMNI (n\u2009=\u2009482). Median radiation dose was 50\u00a0Gy. Median follow-up was 98\u00a0months. IMNI improved 8-year DFS rates versus no IMNI: 75.9% and 64.9% (p\u2009<\u20090.001). After PSM, baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two groups. IMNI significantly improved DFS (p\u2009<\u20090.001) in patients after PSM. IMNI was an independent prognostic factor for DFS.In this study, we found that IMNI improved DFS and OS in breast cancer patients in the context of modern systemic treatment. These data continue to support that IMNI is a key component of RNI.",
  "The treatment of early breast cancer using breast conservation therapy (BCT) commonly ensures local control and acceptable cosmetic results. We herein report a useful technique for obtaining symmetry of the breast shape and a level inframammary line and nipple-areola that achieved excellent results. Four Japanese patients with early breast cancer located on the upper inner area of the breast were enrolled into this study. De-epithelialized skin close to the resected area and skin from the epigastric area with subdermal fatty tissue were moved to repair the defect. Oncoplastic breast surgery (OBS) combining partial mastectomy with the V-rotation mammoplasty technique was useful for patients with breast cancer on the upper inner area of minimal ptotic breasts.",
  "Ribosomal biogenesis and ribosomal proteins have attracted attention in the context of tumor biology in recent years. Instead of being mere translational machineries, ribosomes might play an active role in tumor initiation and progression. Despite its importance, regulation of ribosomal biogenesis is still not completely understood.Using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of RNA sequencing and proteomical mass spectrometry data in breast cancer cells expressing Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 7 (KLF7), we identified processes altered by this transcription factor. In silico analyses of a cohort of breast cancer patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas confirmed our finding. We further verified the role of KLF7 the identified ribosomal processes in in vitro assays of mammary carcinoma cell lines and analyses of breast cancer patients' tissue slices.We identified the transcription factor Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 7 (KLF7) as a regulator of ribosomal biogenesis and translation in breast cancer cells and tissue. Highly significant overlapping processes related to ribosomal biogenesis were identified in proteomics and transcriptomics data and confirmed in patients' breast cancer RNA Seq data. Further, nucleoli, the sites of ribosomal biogenesis, were morphologically altered and quantitatively increased in KLF7-expressing cells. Pre-rRNA processing was identified as one potential process affected by KLF7. In addition, an increase in global translation independent from proliferation and transcription was observed upon exogenous KLF7 expression in vitro. Importantly, in a cohort of breast cancer patients, KLF7-expression levels correlated with aggressiveness of the intrinsic breast cancer subtype and tumor grading. Moreover, KLF7 correlated with nucleolar characteristics in human breast tumor tissue, indicating a role for KLF7 in ribosomal biogenesis.In mammary carcinoma, KLF7 is involved in ribosomal biogenesis. Alterations of ribosomal biogenesis has far reaching quantitative and qualitative implications for the proteome of the cancer cells. This might influence the aggressiveness of cancer cells.",
  "The molecular mechanisms driving metastatic progression in breast cancer patients remain poorly understood. Here, we identified N4BP3 as a new regulator in promoting breast cancer metastasis. N4BP3 is enriched in breast tumor tissue and negatively correlates with clinical outcomes in breast cancer patients. The results show that N4BP3 plays a crucial role in regulating breast cancer cell invasion in vitro, and N4BP3 depletion suppresses metastases formation in vivo. N4BP3 alters the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers and specifically targets E-cadherin in breast cancer cells. Intriguingly, we identified a novel E3 ligase NEDD4 for E-cadherin, and further revealed that N4BP3 promotes breast cancer metastasis via NEDD4-mediated E-cadherin ubiquitination and degradation. Together, this study uncovers an unprecedented role for N4BP3 in breast cancer metastasis and elucidates the underlying molecular mechanisms.",
  "This paper examines the utility of a common climacteric symptoms scale, the Greene Climacteric Scale (GCS), in two groups of women with a history of breast cancer, those who were at menopause before commencing breast cancer treatment, and those who were not.This pooled analysis of 297 women previously diagnosed with breast cancer, aged 28-74 years, was undertaken on baseline data from two structured lifestyle interventions: the Women's Wellness After Cancer Program (WWACP) and the Younger Women's Wellness After Cancer Program (YWWACP). Data were split into two data subsets (women who were post-menopausal on commencement of breast cancer treatment and those who were either pre- or peri\u2011menopausal). Multitrait/multi-item analysis was conducted to test scaling assumptions for each group separately.GCS domain scores were positively skewed, with significant floor effects for vasomotor symptoms and ceiling effects for sexual dysfunction. Multitrait analysis showed acceptable convergent validity (77% of items correlated \u2265 0.40 with their hypothesized domains) but weak discriminant validity for anxiety, depression, and somatic symptoms in both groups. The exploratory factor analysis in women who were menopausal at the commencement of breast cancer treatment and those who were not revealed distinct factor structures that accounted for 60.2% and 62.7% of the total variance, respectively.The original GCS factor structure was not replicated in this sample. Among women previously treated for breast cancer, the presence of multiple concurrent and severe menopausal symptoms with possible treatment-related causes underpins the need for a breast cancer-specific measure to enhance their identification and management.WWACP, ACTRN12614000800628; YWWACP, ACTRN12614001087640.",
  "Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies and the major cause of cancer-related death in women. Although the importance of PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in cancer has been increasingly recognized, few studies have been explored the functional mechanism of piRNAs in breast cancer development and progression.We examined the top 20 highly expressed piRNAs based on the analysis of TCGA breast cancer data in two patient cohorts to test the roles of piRNAs in breast cancer. The effects of piRNA-36,712 on the malignant phenotypes and chemosensitivity of breast cancer cells were detected in vitro and in vivo. MS2-RIP and reporter gene assays were conducted to identify the interaction and regulation among piRNA-36,712, miRNAs and SEPW1P. Kaplan-Meier estimate with log-rank test was used to compare patient survival by different piRNA-36,712 expression levels.We found piRNA-36,712 level was significantly lower in breast cancer than in normal breast tissues and low level was correlated with poor clinical outcome in patients. Functional studies demonstrated that piRNA-36,712 interacts with RNAs produced by SEPW1P, a retroprocessed pseudogene of SEPW1, and subsequently inhibits SEPW1 expression through competition of SEPW1 mRNA with SEPW1P RNA for microRNA-7 and microRNA-324. We also found that higher SEPW1 expression due to downregulation of piRNA-36,712 in breast cancer may suppress P53, leading to the upregulated Slug but decreased P21 and E-cadherin levels, thus promoting cancer cell proliferation, invasion and migration. Furthermore, we found that piRNA-36,712 had synergistic anticancer effects with the paclitaxel and doxorubicin, two chemotherapeutic agents for breast cancer.These findings suggest that piRNA-36,712 is a novel tumor suppressor and may serve as a potential predictor for the prognosis of breast cancer patients.",
  "The management of breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM) has historically involved local therapies. However, as novel systemic treatments have become more effective in controlling visceral disease, BCBM have also been better controlled. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have demonstrated efficacy in brain metastases in patients with lung cancer and melanoma and represent a promising option for patients with triple-negative BCBM, a group with limited systemic therapy options. In this review we summarize current data about the role of ICIs in the treatment BCBM. We identified 15 clinical trials that evaluated ICIs \u00b1 chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer. The studies were mostly focused on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Of these trials, 4 excluded patients with BCBM, while 11 allowed patients with stable, treated or asymptomatic BCBM. In total, 2692 patients were enrolled in the identified clinical trials, but only 91 trial patients (3.3%) had BCBM. Furthermore, only 2 of these clinical trials reported BCBM-specific outcomes and none of the clinical trials reported BCBM-specific adverse events. Up to 45% of patients with TNBC will develop BCBM; however, only 3.3% of the patients included in the clinical trials that led to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approvals for ICIs in advanced breast cancer had brain metastases. This review reinforces that efficacy data are greatly needed for patients with BCBM-this is an area of unmet need in oncology. More inclusive clinical trials and real-world data that evaluate the safety and efficacy of ICIs in patients with BCBM are greatly needed.",
  "Tumor stroma, of which fibroblasts are the most abundant cell, resembles a non-healing wound, where a procoagulant environment creates a permissive milieu for cancer growth. We aimed to determine if tumor expression of coagulation factors (procoagulant phenotype), and systemic hypercoagulability, occur at the preinvasive (ductal carcinoma in situ; DCIS) stage and correlate with breast cancer subtype, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS).In a prospective cohort of early breast cancer (DCIS, n\u00a0=\u00a076; invasive, n\u00a0=\u00a0248) tumor, normal breast and plasma were examined. Fibroblast and epithelial expression of Tissue Factor\u00a0(TF), thrombin, PAR1, PAR2, and plasma thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) and D-dimer were correlated with clinicopathological data, and 5-year survival.Fibroblast expression of TF, thrombin, and PAR1 was increased in DCIS and invasive cancer compared to normal breast fibroblasts (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a0.003, all). Fibroblast TF, thrombin, PAR1, and PAR2 was increased in cancers with high Ki67, high grade, ER-\u00a0(vs ER+), and HER2+ (vs HER2-) (all P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). On univariate analysis, fibroblast TF expression was inversely associated with DFS (P\u00a0=\u00a0.04) and OS (P\u00a0=\u00a0.02). D-dimer was higher in node positive (507 (CI: 411-625)\u00a0ng/mL, n\u00a0=\u00a068) vs negative patients\u00a0(428 (CI: 387-472)\u00a0ng/mL, n\u00a0=\u00a0171, P\u00a0=\u00a0.004) and inversely associated with OS (P\u00a0=\u00a0.047). On multivariate analysis, plasma TAT was associated with reduced OS (HR 3.26, CI 1.16-3.1, P\u00a0=\u00a0.02), with a high plasma TAT (\u22653.2\u00a0ng/mL) associated with\u00a0>\u00a03-fold mortality risk compared to low TAT.This demonstrates procoagulant phenotypic changes occur in fibroblasts at the preinvasive stage. Fibroblast procoagulant phenotype is associated with aggressive breast cancer subtypes and reduced survival. Coagulation may be a therapeutic target in breast cancer.",
  "<b>Objective:</b> To explore the method of predicting high lymph node load in patients with early breast cancer to avoid unnecessary sentinel lymph node biopsy. <b>Methods:</b> The clinicopathological and thoracic multi-slice spiral CT (MSCT) data of 2620 patients with early (cT1~2N0M0) breast cancer treated in the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University from January 1, 2014 to August 1, 2018 were collected. According to the postoperative pathological results, the patients were divided into the group with axillaryhigh lymph node burden (HNB) and the non-HNB group. The influencing factors of axillary lymph node burden in patients with early breast cancer were determined by univariate and multivariate analysis, and the diagnostic model of MSCT to HNB was established. The best cutoff value for the diagnosis of HNB was determined through analyzing the receiver operative characteristic (ROC) curve, and the consistency between MSCT diagnosis and pathological diagnosis was evaluated by <i>Kappa</i> test. <b>Results:</b> Among the 2 620 patients, 168 were diagnosed of HNB. Univariate analysis showed that the tumor size, the status of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), the number of abnormal lymph nodes showed in MSCT, the ratio of the length to the diameter of the maximum abnormal lymph node as shown in MSCT, the condition of the maximum abnormal lymph node door, and the parenchyma of the maximum abnormal lymph node were related to axillary lymph node burden in patients with early breast cancer (<i>P</i><0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that the number of abnormal lymph nodes showed in MSCT was an independent influencing factor of axillary HNB in patients with early breast cancer. Compared with patients without abnormal lymph nodes, the <i>OR</i> values of patients with 1, 2, 3 or more abnormal lymph nodes displayed by MSCT and in axillary HNB status were 3.305, 9.379, 126.163 and 780.953, respectively. Using 3 or more abnormal lymph nodes detected by MSCT to predict the area under the ROC curve of axillary HNB in patients with early breast cancer, the area was 0.928, the sensitivity was 82.1%, the specificity was 95.4%, and the accuracy was 94.5%. <i>Kappa</i> test showed that the consistency between MSCT diagnosis and pathological diagnosis was relatively high (<i>Kappa</i>=0.629, <i>P</i><0.001). <b>Conclusions:</b> The number of abnormal lymph nodes showed in MSCT is an independent influencing factor of axillary HNB in patients with early breast cancer. Taking 3 or more abnormal lymph nodes showed in MSCT as the threshold can help to predict the axillary HNB status of early breast cancer patients and exempt some of them from unnecessary sentinel lymph node biopsy.",
  "Breast cancer is an extremely aggressive cancer in women. Its abnormalities can be observed in the form of masses, calcification and lumps. In order to reduce the mortality rate of women its detection is needed at an early stage. The present paper proposes a novel bi-modal extended Huber loss function based refined mask regional convolutional neural network for automatic multi-instance detection and localization of breast cancer. To refine and increase the efficacy of the proposed method three changes are casted. First, a pre-processing step is performed for mammogram and ultrasound breast images. Second, the features of the region proposal network are separately mapped for accurate region of interest. Third, to reduce overfitting and fast convergence, an extended Huber loss function is used at the place of <i>Smooth</i><sub><i>L</i>1</sub>(<i>x</i>) in boundary loss. To extend the functionality of Huber loss, the delta parameter is automated by the aid of median absolute deviation with grid search algorithm. It provides the best optimum value of delta instead of user-based value. The proposed method is compared with pre-existing methods in terms of accuracy, true positive rate, true negative rate, precision, <i>F</i>-score, balanced classification rate, Youden's index, Jaccard Index and dice coefficient on CBIS-DDSM and ultrasound database. The experimental result shows that the proposed method is a better suited approach for multi-instance detection, localization and classification of breast cancer. It can be used as a diagnostic medium that helps in clinical purposes and leads to a precise diagnosis of breast cancer abnormalities.",
  "Locoregional therapy (LRT) in de novo metastatic disease is controversial with inconsistent results from randomized control trials (RCTs).RCTs comparing LRT and systemic therapy to standard therapy alone in de novo metastatic breast cancer were identified. Hazard ratios (HRs) and their associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed and pooled in a meta-analysis using generic inverse variance. Overall survival (OS) and time to locoregional progression data were extracted for the intention to treat (ITT) population. Data on OS for pre-specified subgroups defined by tumor subtype and by site of metastases were also extracted.Analyses included 4 trials comprising 970 patients. LRT included standard surgery to the primary breast tumor in all studies, and adjuvant radiation per standard of care was required in 3 studies. Compared to standard treatment, LRT was not associated with improved OS in the ITT population (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.72-1.29, p\u00a0=\u00a00.81). However, LRT was associated with improved time to locoregional progression (HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.14-0.95, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). LRT was not associated with improved OS in any tumor subtypes, including hormone receptor positive (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.65-1.43), triple negative (HR 1.4, 95% CI 0.50-3.91) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive disease (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.68-1.28). Additionally, LRT did not improve OS in bone only disease (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.58-1.62) and in visceral disease (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.02, 95% CI 0.77-1.35). Our critical appraisal has identified some methodological problems in the design and conduct of the studies included that could affect the meta-analysis result.LRT in de novo metastatic breast cancer is not associated with improved OS. Results are consistent among different breast cancer subgroups. However, this conclusion should be interpreted with caution in view of the limitations identified in meta-analysis.",
  "A healthy microbiome is important for human health because it exhibits a variety of functions in the human body wherein the microbiome dysbiosis can lead to a variety of diseases, including cancer. Recent advances in technology and cost reduction of sequencing have made it possible and much easier for researchers to investigate the role of the microbiome in carcinogenesis. Furthermore, modulation of microflora may serve as an effective adjunct to conventional anticancer therapy that is very important to improve the patient's quality of life. Additionally, microbiome biomarkers can also be used as a diagnostic tool for cancer. So far the association between oral microbial consortia and their interactions with the host in maintaining the human health and the pathogenesis of multiple cancers has gained much popularity in the scientific research community. While the interactions of oral microflora are better established in cancer- like gastric cancer, it is far less understood in others like breast cancer. Therefore, this review briefly outlines the current information on the role of oral microbiota in breast cancer with emphasis on the mechanisms of oral microflora induced carcinogenesis and discusses the emerging role of periodontitis as a risk factor for breast cancer. Clinical relevance; Periodontitis is a very common disease that is characterized by chronic polymicrobial infection and inflammation of gingiva. It might be associated as a risk factor for breast cancer. If this association is validated in large cohort studies, it would serve as a non-invasive biomarker for breast cancer.",
  "<i>Background and Objectives</i>: This study aimed to analyze the prevalence of mental disorders in patients with breast cancer at Ajou University Hospital. In addition, the patterns and prevalence of mental disorders according to the occurrence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were analyzed. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: From 1 January 2008 to 30 June 2021, psychiatric disorders were identified in 5174 female patients diagnosed with breast cancer at Ajou University Hospital. Based on the time when COVID-19 occurred, the pattern of onset of mental disorders in patients with breast cancer was analyzed. In addition, the prevalence of mental disorders according to the time of breast cancer diagnosis and age was evaluated. <i>Results</i>: A year before the diagnosis of breast cancer, 371 patients were diagnosed with a mental disorder. Of these, 201 patients were diagnosed with stress and adjustment disorders, and 97 patients had anxiety disorders. The overall frequency of psychiatric disorders after breast cancer diagnosis peaked two months later. Among psychiatric disorders reported before the COVID-19 pandemic, the proportion of stress/adaptation disorders was 52%, and among psychiatric disorders reported after the pandemic, it was significantly higher at 94.7%. Anxiety was found to be high in the elderly group aged \u2265 60 years, and the prevalence of stress and adjustment disorders tended to increase in the non-elderly group. <i>Conclusions</i>: Breast cancer patients showed different patterns of psychiatric disorders according to age, time of breast cancer diagnosis, and the occurrence of COVID-19. Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, delays in treatment and anxiety about infection have increased the rate of stress and adjustment disorders in cancer patients. Mental health management during the pandemic and after cancer diagnosis can improve the quality of life of patients with cancer.",
  "Studies examining biomarkers associated with fatigue in breast cancer survivors treated with radiation are limited. Therefore, we examined the longitudinal association between serum biomarkers and post-breast cancer fatigue in survivors treated with radiation: [oxidative stress] 8-hydroxyguanosine, myeloperoxidase; [inflammation] interleukin-6 (IL-6), c-reactive protein, growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), placental growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta, [cardiac damage] cystatin-C, troponin-I.In a secondary analysis, we included participants from the Women's Health Initiative if they had: a previous breast cancer diagnosis (stages I-III), no prior cardiovascular diseases, pre-and post-breast cancer serum samples drawn approximately 3\u00a0years apart, and fatigue measured using the Short-Form 36 vitality subscale at both serum collections. Biomarkers were measured using ELISA or RT-qPCR and modeled as the log<sub>2</sub> post-to pre-breast cancer ratio.Overall, 180 women with a mean (SD) age of 67.0 (5.5) years were included. The mean (SD) vitality scores were 66.2 (17.2) and 59.7 (19.7) pre- and post-breast cancer, respectively. Using multivariable weighted linear regression, higher biomarker ratios of cystatin-C, IL-6, and GDF-15 were associated with a lower vitality score (i.e., higher fatigue). For example, for each 2-fold difference in cystatin-C biomarker ratio, the vitality score was lower by 7.31 points (95% CI: -14.2, -0.45).Inflammatory and cardiac damage biomarkers are associated with fatigue in breast cancer survivors treated with radiation; however, these findings should be replicated in a larger sample. Biomarkers could be measured in clinical practice or assessed in risk prediction models to help identify patients at high risk for fatigue.",
  "Socioeconomic and treatment factors contribute to diagnosis of early-stage (local-stage) breast cancer, as well as excess deaths among African American women.We evaluated socioeconomic and treatment predictive factors for early-stage breast cancer among African American women compared to Caucasian women. A secondary aim evaluated predictors and overall risks associated with all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality.We used retrospective cohort population-based study data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program on 547,703 women aged \u2265\u200920\u00a0years diagnosed with breast cancer primary tumors from 2007 to 2016. Statistical analysis used logistic regression to assess predictors of early-stage breast cancer and Cox proportional hazards regression for mortality risks.African American women were more likely to be diagnosed at advanced-stage, had larger tumor size at diagnosis, and received less cancer-directed surgery, but more chemotherapy than Caucasian women. Insured women (>\u200950%) were more likely to be diagnosed at early-stage and to have smaller tumors (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Education level, poverty level, and household income had no impact on racial disparities or socioeconomic disparities in women diagnosed at early stage. We found increased risks for all-cause mortality (hazard ratio\u2009=\u20091.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-1.21) and breast cancer-specific mortality (HR\u2009=\u20091.22; 95% CI, 1.19-1.25) among African American women compared to Caucasian women after adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, and treatment factors.In this population-based study using the most recent SEER data, African American women with breast cancer continued to exhibit higher all-cause mortality and breast cancer-specific mortality compared to Caucasian women.",
  "The single progesterone receptor (PR)-positive phenotype (estrogen receptor (ER)-/PR\u2009+\u2009, sPR positive) is an infrequent and independent biological entity. However, the prognosis of patients with sPR-positive and her-2-negative phenotype is still controversial, and it is not always easy to decide treatment strategies for them.Patients during 2010-2014 were identified from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to evaluate\u00a0cancer-specific\u00a0survival (CSS). The propensity score matching (PSM) method was used to balance differences of characteristics in groups. The Life-Table method was used to calculate 5-year CSS rates and the annual hazard rate of death (HRD).A total of 97,527 patients were included, and only 745 (0.76%) patients were sPR-positive phenotype. The majority of sPR-positive breast cancer were basal-like subtype. Survival analysis showed that the sPR-positive breast cancer had similar prognosis comparing to double hormonal receptor-negative (ER-/PR-, dHoR-negative) breast cancer, and had the highest HRD during the initial 1-2\u00a0years of follow-up, then maintained the HRD of almost zero during the late years of follow-up.The patients with sPR-positive and her-2-negative breast cancer, similar to dHoR-negative breast cancer, had a worse survival, and could benefit from chemotherapy significantly. However, the escalating endocrine therapy was not recommended for sPR-positive patients. The patients with sPR positive should be excluded from future clinical trials concerning endocrine therapy.",
  "To evaluate prevalence of nonadherence to breast cancer screening guidelines after bedside educational intervention and informed individualized risk assessment score during an inpatient stay.A prospective intervention study was conducted among 507 cancer-free (except skin cancer) women aged 50-75\u00a0years hospitalized to a general medicine service. Study intervention included one-on-one bedside education via handout and videos about breast cancer screening and informed individualized risk assessment using the Gail risk model to predict 5-year risk for breast cancer development. Study outcomes were measured using posthospitalization follow-up survey to determine if intervention resulted in improved adherence to breast cancer screening. Chi-square and unpaired <i>t</i>-tests were utilized to compare population characteristics.The mean age for the study population was 60.5\u00a0years (SD\u00a0=\u00a06.9), the mean 5-year Gail risk score was 1.77 (SD\u00a0=\u00a01), and 36% of women were African American. One hundred sixty nine (33%) hospitalized women were nonadherent to breast cancer screening recommendations. Only 15% of the nonadherent women were reachable for follow-up survey, and 42% of these women self-reported adherence to screening mammography after a mean follow-up period of 27\u00a0months.This study provides evidence that most women who are nonadherent to breast cancer screening remain nonadherent after hospital discharge despite educational interventions. Our study intervention was only partially successful in enhancing breast cancer screening among hospitalized women who were overdue and at high risk. Further studies need to evaluate strategies to overcome the barriers and improve adherence whenever patients encounter health care system regardless of clinical locale.",
  "MDM2/MDMX proteins are frequently elevated in hormone receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. We sought to determine the antitumor efficacy of the combination of ALRN-6924, a dual inhibitor of MDM2/MDMX, with chemotherapy in ER+ breast cancer models.Three hundred two cell lines representing multiple tumor types were screened to confirm the role of TP53 status in ALRN-6924 efficacy. ER+ breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and ZR-75-1) were used to investigate the antitumor efficacy of ALRN-6924 combination. In vitro cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis assays were performed. Xenograft tumor volumes were measured, and reverse-phase protein array (RPPA), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and TUNEL assay of tumor tissues were performed to evaluate the in vivo pharmacodynamic effects of ALRN-6924 with paclitaxel.ALRN-6924 was active in wild-type TP53 (WT-TP53) cancer cell lines, but not mutant TP53. On ER+ breast cancer cell lines, it was synergistic in vitro and had enhanced in vivo antitumor activity with both paclitaxel and eribulin. Flow cytometry revealed signs of mitotic crisis in all treatment groups; however, S phase was only decreased in MCF-7 single agent and combinatorial ALRN-6924 arms. RPPA and IHC demonstrated an increase in p21 expression in both combinatorial and single agent ALRN-6924 in vivo treatment groups. Apoptotic assays revealed a significantly enhanced in vivo apoptotic rate in ALRN-6924 combined with paclitaxel treatment arm compared to either single agent.The significant synergy observed with ALRN-6924 in combination with chemotherapeutic agents supports further evaluation in patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.",
  "Light at night (LAN) may alter estrogen regulation through circadian disruption. High levels of outdoor LAN may increase breast cancer risk, but studies have largely not considered possible residual confounding from correlated environmental exposures. We evaluated the association between indoor and outdoor LAN and incident breast cancer.In 47,145 participants in the prospective Sister Study cohort living in the contiguous U.S., exposure to outdoor LAN was determined using satellite-measured residential data and indoor LAN was self-reported (light/TV on, light from outside the room, nightlight, no light). We used Cox proportional hazards models to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between outdoor and indoor LAN and breast cancer risk. Models were adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, annual household income, neighborhood disadvantage, latitude, and population density as a proxy for urbanicity. To evaluate the potential for residual confounding of the outdoor LAN and breast cancer relationship by factors associated with urbanicity, we considered further adjustment for exposures correlated with outdoor LAN including NO<sub>2</sub> [Spearman correlation coefficient, rho (\u03c1)\u00a0=\u00a00.78], PM<sub>2.5</sub> (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.36), green space (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a00.41), and noise (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.81).During 11\u00a0years of follow-up, 3,734 breast cancer cases were identified. Outdoor LAN was modestly, but non-monotonically, associated with a higher risk of breast cancer (Quintile 4 vs 1: HR\u00a0=\u00a01.10, 95% CI: 0.99-1.22; Quintile 5 vs 1: HR\u00a0=\u00a01.04, 95% CI: 0.93-1.16); however, no association was evident after adjustment for correlated ambient exposures (Quintile 4 vs 1: HR\u00a0=\u00a00.99, 95% CI: 0.86-1.14; Quintile 5 vs 1: HR\u00a0=\u00a00.89, 95% CI: 0.74-1.06). Compared to those with no indoor LAN exposure, sleeping with a light or TV on was associated with a HR\u00a0=\u00a01.09 (95% CI: 0.97-1.23) in the adjusted model.Outdoor LAN does not appear to increase the risk of breast cancer after adjustment for correlated environmental exposures.",
  "To explore the experiences of women with breast cancer and pelvic floor (PF) dysfunction and the perceived enablers and barriers to uptake of treatment for PF dysfunction during their recovery.Purposive sampling was used to recruit 30 women with a past diagnosis of breast cancer and PF dysfunction. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, and data were analysed inductively to identify new concepts in the experiences of PF dysfunction in women with breast cancer and deductively according to the capability, opportunity, motivation and behaviour (COM-B) framework to identify the enablers and barriers to the uptake of treatment for PF dysfunction in women with breast cancer.Participants were aged between 31 and 88\u00a0years, diagnosed with stages I-IV breast cancer and experienced either urinary incontinence (n\u2009=\u200924/30, 80%), faecal incontinence (n\u2009=\u20096/30, 20%) or sexual dysfunction (n\u2009=\u200920/30, 67%). They were either resigned to or bothered by their PF dysfunction; bother was exacerbated by embarrassment from experiencing PF symptoms in public. Barriers to accessing treatment for PF dysfunction included a lack of awareness about PF dysfunction following breast cancer treatments and health care professionals not focussing on the management of PF symptoms during cancer treatment. An enabler was their motivation to resume their normal pre-cancer lives.Participants in this study reported that there needs to be more awareness about PF dysfunction in women undergoing treatment for breast cancer. They would like to receive information about PF dysfunction prior to starting cancer treatment, be screened for PF dysfunction during cancer treatment and be offered therapies for their PF dysfunction after primary cancer treatment. Therefore, a greater focus on managing PF symptoms by clinicians may be warranted in women with breast cancer.",
  "Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is incurable, with a 5-year survival rate of 28%. In the USA, more than 42,000 patients die from MBC every year. The most common type of breast cancer is estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), and more patients die from ER+ breast cancer than from any other subtype. ER+ tumors can be successfully treated with hormone therapy, but many tumors acquire endocrine resistance, at which point treatment options are limited. There is an urgent need for model systems that better represent human ER+ MBC in vivo, where tumors can metastasize. Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) made from MBC spontaneously metastasize, but the immunodeficient host is a caveat, given the known role of the immune system in tumor progression and response to therapy. Thus, we attempted to develop an immune-humanized PDX model of ER+ MBC.NSG-SGM3 mice were immune-humanized with CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells, followed by engraftment of human ER+ endocrine resistant MBC tumor fragments. Strategies for exogenous estrogen supplementation were compared, and immune-humanization in blood, bone marrow, spleen, and tumors was assessed by flow cytometry and tissue immunostaining. Characterization of the new model includes assessment of the human tumor microenvironment performed by immunostaining.We describe the development of an immune-humanized PDX model of estrogen-independent endocrine resistant ER+ MBC. Importantly, our model harbors a naturally occurring ESR1 mutation, and immune-humanization recapitulates the lymphocyte-excluded and myeloid-rich tumor microenvironment of human ER+ breast tumors.This model sets the stage for development of other clinically relevant models of human breast cancer and should allow future studies on mechanisms of endocrine resistance and tumor-immune interactions in an immune-humanized in vivo setting.",
  "Schizophrenia is a devastating mental disease that affects approximately 1% of the world's population. Breast cancer is the second most common type of cancer in the world that causes death in women. It is often unclear whether patients with schizophrenia receive recommended cancer treatment that met the guideline. This study characterized breast cancer treatment disruptions in schizophrenia patients and sought to identify and resolve correctable predictors of those disruptions.A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 55 primary breast cancer patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and treated for breast cancer. We evaluated the characteristics of the breast cancer patients with schizophrenia compared to those of 610 breast cancer patients without schizophrenia.Compared to the control group, the schizophrenia group had significantly advanced T and N factors and disease stage. Significantly fewer patients in the schizophrenia group than in the control group received chemotherapy (P < .0001) or recommended cancer treatment (P\u00a0=\u00a0.0004). Within the schizophrenia group, the patients in need of ADL support were significantly less likely to receive recommended cancer treatment.Patients with schizophrenia are often diagnosed with breast cancer in advanced stages. In addition, patients with schizophrenia with reduced ADL are less likely to receive chemotherapy or recommended cancer treatment. It is highly recommended that patients with schizophrenia undergo breast cancer screening so that they can be diagnosed early and treated adequately.",
  "Preclinical and epidemiological studies indicate a potential chemopreventive role of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) -lowering drugs in the risks of breast cancer and prostate cancer, but the causality remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the association of genetically proxied inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) with risks of breast cancer and prostate cancer using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) method.Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HMGCR, NPC1L1, and PCSK9 associated with LDL-C in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis from the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (GLGC; up to 188,577 European individuals) were used to proxy inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, NPC1L1, and PCSK9. Summary statistics with outcomes were obtained from a GWAS meta-analysis of the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC; 228,951 European females) and a Prostate Cancer\u00a0Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome (PRACTICAL; 140,254 European males)\u00a0consortium. SNPs were combined into multiallelic models and MR estimates representing lifelong inhibition of targets were generated using the inverse-variance weighted method.Genetically proxied inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase (OR: 0.84; 95% CI 0.74-0.95; P\u2009=\u20090.005) and NPC1L1 (OR: 0.72; 95% CI 0.58-0.90; P\u2009=\u20090.005) equivalent to a 1-mmol/L (38.7\u00a0mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C was associated with reduced breast cancer risk. There were no significant associations of genetically proxied inhibition of PCSK9 with breast cancer. In contrast, genetically proxied inhibition of PCSK9 (OR: 0.81; 95% CI 0.73-0.90; P\u2009<\u20090.001) but not HMG-CoA reductase and NPC1L1 was negatively associated with prostate cancer. In the secondary analysis, genetically proxied inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase (OR: 0.82; 95% CI 0.71-0.95; P\u2009=\u20090.008) and NPC1L1 (OR: 0.66; 95% CI 0.50-0.86; P\u2009=\u20090.002) was associated with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, whereas there was no association of HMG-CoA reductase and NPC1L1 with estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer.Genetically proxied inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase and NPC1L1 was significantly associated with lower odds of breast cancer, while genetically proxied inhibition of PCSK9 was associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the respective roles of these LDL-C-lowering drugs in breast cancer and prostate cancer.",
  "While the association between diagnosis of breast cancer and post-diagnosis psychological distress has been well documented, data regarding pre-diagnosis psychological distress in the breast cancer population are limited. Here, we assessed pre-diagnosis major life stressors and breast cancer outcomes, namely stage of disease and choice of surgery, in a single-center population.Patients with newly diagnosed clinical stage 0-3 breast cancer seen at Mayo Clinic Florida between June 11, 2018, and October 7, 2019, were administered voluntary telephone surveys to assess major life stressors during the 24\u00a0months preceding their cancer diagnosis. Subsequent clinical outcomes of cancer stage at diagnosis and surgical treatment were obtained through retrospective chart review. Study subjects who had experienced major life stressors and those who had not were compared using Chi-square tests.Of 222 patients who were included, 51.3% reported experiencing a major life event before breast cancer diagnosis. 43.9% of these patients endorsed family-related stress. 21.1% had experienced multiple stressors. 1.8% described financial stress. Although more patients in the group with pre-diagnosis stress had carcinoma in situ (21.1% versus 13.0%, p\u2009=\u20090.11) and fewer had stage T1/T2 disease (64% versus 73.1%, p\u2009=\u20090.14) than in the group without stress, these differences were not statistically significant. More patients with pre-diagnosis stress chose mastectomy (34.2% versus 22.2%, p\u2009=\u20090.048).Psychological distress is prevalent prior to breast cancer diagnosis and may merit early intervention. While additional study in diverse populations is needed, current data suggest possible associations between pre-diagnosis psychological distress and surgical decision making, specifically mastectomy.",
  "Worldwide breast cancer ranks first in mortality and incidence rates in women over 20 years old. Rather than one disease, breast cancer is a heterogeneous group of diseases that express distinct molecular profiles. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is an important therapeutic strategy for breast cancer patients independently of their molecular subtype, with the drawback of resistance development. In addition, chemotherapy has adverse effects that combined with resistance could contribute to lower overall survival. Although great efforts have been made to find diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for breast cancer and for response to targeted and immune therapy for this pathology, little has been explored regarding biomarkers of response to anthracyclines and taxanes based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This work aimed to evaluate the molecular profile of patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that could be used as biomarkers of chemotherapy response and overall survival. Breast cancer patients who were candidates for neoadjuvant chemotherapy were enrolled in this study. After treatment and according to their pathological response, they were assigned as sensitive or resistant. To evaluate DEGs, Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia Gene and Genome (KEGG), and protein-protein interactions, RNA-seq information from all patients was obtained by next-generation sequencing. A total of 1985 DEGs were found, and KEGG analysis indicated a great number of DEGs in metabolic pathways, pathways in cancer, cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, and neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions. A selection of 73 DEGs was used further for an analysis of overall survival using the METABRIC study and the ductal carcinoma dataset of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Nine DEGs correlated with overall survival, of which the subexpression of <i>C1QTNF3, CTF1, OLFML3, PLA2R1, PODN, KRT15, HLA-A,</i> and the overexpression of <i>TUBB</i> and <i>TCP1</i> were found in resistant patients and related to patients with lower overall survival.",
  "<b>Background:</b> Breast cancer is a pivotal cause of global women cancer death. Immunotherapy has become a promising means to cure breast cancer. As constitutes of immune microenvironment of breast cancer, macrophages exert complicated functions in the tumour development and treatment. This study aims to develop a prognostic macrophage marker genes signature (MMGS).<b>Methods:</b> Single cell RNA sequence data analysis was performed to identify macrophage marker genes in breast cancer. TCGA database was used to construct MMGS model as a training cohort, and GSE96058 dataset was used to validate the MMGS as a validation cohort.<b>Results:</b> Genes included in the MMGS model were: SERPINA1, CD74, STX11, ADAM9, CD24, NFKBIA, PGK1. MMGS risk score stratified by overall survival of patients divided them into high- and low-risk groups. And MMGS risk score remained independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis after adjusting for classical clinical factors in both training and validation cohorts. Besides, hormone receptors negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive patients had higher risk score. MMGS showed better distinguishing capability between high-risk and low-risk groups in hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative subgroup.<b>Conclusion:</b> MMGS provides a new understanding of immune cell marker genes in breast cancer prognosis and may offer reference for immunotherapy decision for breast cancer patients.",
  "Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) is a potential oncogene that is significantly up-regulated in patients with breast cancer. MicroRNAs (miRs) are a group of small non-coding and regulatory RNAs which have recently been proposed as promising molecules for breast cancer target therapy. In the current study, we investigated the impact of miR-589-5p/ HDAC3 axis on cancer cell development in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells.In-silico analysis determined that miR-589-5p potentially targets HDAC3. We evaluated the HDAC3 and mir-589-5p expression levels in clinical samples and breast cancer cell lines including MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, MCF-7 and MCF-10A. HDAC3 was knocked out to investigate its role on cancer cell progression. Anti-cancerous role of the miR-589-5p was assessed using an expression vector. We evaluated possible alteration in the cell cycle progression, cell viability and cell proliferation, after transient transfection.HDAC3 was over-expressed in TNBC clinical samples and breast cancer cell lines compared to non-cancerous controls while miR-589-5p was down regulated in cancer cells. Suppression of HDAC3 decreased the cell viability, cell proliferation and colony formation. Similar results were observed after over-expression of the miR-589-5p. Dual-Luciferase reporter assay confirmed the direct targeting of HDAC3 by miR-589-5p.Our results showed that miR-589-5p mediates its anti-proliferative effects on breast cancer cells via targeting HDAC3. These findings suggest that the miR-589-5p/ HDAC3 axis could be considered as a possible therapeutic strategy in TNBC.",
  "A breast cancer diagnosis can be a life-changing and stressful experience that can lead to chronic mental health conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Greater than one-third of patients initially diagnosed with PTSD after a diagnosis of breast cancer continue to have persistent or worsening PTSD symptoms after 4\u00a0years. An emerging body of literature has indicated several key environmental and biological risk factors for PTSD among survivors of breast cancer. Well-recognized risk factors include having a history of childhood trauma, being nonwhite, obesity, younger age at the time of diagnosis, diagnosis with a higher stage of breast cancer, and short time since treatment. Of the emerging risk factors related to fear circuitry in the brain, 2 pathways of particular importance are the stress-driven activation of inflammatory pathways and the long-term effect of antiendocrine therapies. These central and peripheral responses during and after stress exposure are important because increased fear and anxiety can lead to the maintenance of PTSD and worse patient outcomes. Given the poor outcomes associated with PTSD and the high prevalence of breast cancer in women, more research to identify those women at heightened risk of PTSD after breast cancer is warranted to reduce the number of diagnoses and lessen the negative impact of this chronic mental health condition.",
  "Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and is one of the three most common malignancies worldwide. Serum microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) are ideal biomarkers for tumor diagnosis and prognosis due to their specific biological characteristics. In several different types of cancer, miRNAs are associated with cell migration and invasion. In the present study, miR\u201125\u20113p expression levels were detected in tissue and serum samples derived from patients with breast cancer, and the diagnostic and prognostic value of miR\u201125\u20113p in breast cancer was evaluated. Cellular function assays were performed to evaluate the role of miR\u201125\u20113p in breast cancer. Moreover, dual\u2011luciferase reporter assays and western blotting were performed to investigate the target of miR\u201125\u20113p. miR\u201125\u20113p expression was upregulated in breast cancer tissue and serum samples compared with normal breast tissue and serum samples. Patients with breast cancer with high serum miR\u201125\u20113p levels were more likely to have lymph node metastasis compared with those with low serum miR\u201125\u20113p levels. The area under the curve for miR\u201125\u20113p in the diagnosis of breast cancer was 0.748, with 57.1%\u00a0sensitivity and 95.0%\u00a0specificity. Moreover, the Kaplan\u2011Meier survival curves demonstrated that patients with breast cancer with a low expression of serum miR\u201125\u20113p had a higher overall survival rate compared with patients with a high serum miR\u201125\u20113p expression. miR\u201125\u20113p knockdown suppressed breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion, and transducer of ERBB2, 1\u00a0(<i>TOB1</i>) was identified as a potential target gene regulated by miR\u201125\u20113p. Therefore, the present study suggested that miR\u201125\u20113p regulated cellular functions via <i>TOB1</i> in breast cancer; therefore, miR\u201125\u20113p may serve as a breast cancer biomarker.",
  "Many women with breast cancer also have a high likelihood of cardiovascular mortality, and while there are several cardiovascular risk prediction models, none have been validated in a cohort of breast cancer patients. We first compared the performance of commonly-used cardiovascular models, and then derived a new model where breast cancer and cardiovascular mortality were modeled simultaneously, to account for the competing risk endpoints and commonality of risk factors between the two events.We included 20,462 women diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer between 2000 and 2010 in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) with follow-up through April 30, 2015, and examined the performance of the Framingham, CORE and SCOREOP cardiovascular risk models by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and observed-to -expected (O/E) ratio. We developed a multi-state model based on cause-specific hazards (CSH) to jointly model the causes of mortality.The extended models including breast cancer characteristics (grade, tumor size, nodal involvement) with CVD risk factors had better discrimination at 5-years with AUCs of 0.85 (95% CI 0.83, 0.86) for cardiovascular death and 0.80 (95% CI 0.78, 0.87) for breast cancer death compared with the existing cardiovascular models evaluated at 5\u00a0years AUCs ranging 0.71-0.78. Five-year calibration for breast and cardiovascular mortality from our multi-state model was also excellent (O/E\u2009=\u20091.01, 95% CI\u20090.91-1.11).A model incorporating cardiovascular risk factors, breast cancer characteristics, and competing events, outperformed traditional models of cardiovascular disease by simultaneously estimating cancer and cardiovascular mortality risks.",
  "The improvement in the quality of life is accompanied by an accelerated pace of living and increased work-related pressures. Recent decades has seen an increase in the proportion of obese patients, as well as an increase in the prevalence of breast cancer. More and more evidences prove that obesity may be one of a prognostic impact factor in patients with breast cancer. Obesity presents unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in the population of breast cancer patients. Therefore, it is essential to have a better understanding of the relationship between obesity and breast cancer. This study aims to construct a prognostic risk prediction model combining obesity and breast cancer. In this study, we obtained a breast cancer sample dataset from the GEO database containing obesity data [determined by the body mass index (BMI)]. A total of 1174 genes that were differentially expressed between breast cancer samples of patients with and without obesity were screened by the rank-sum test. After weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), 791 related genes were further screened. Relying on single-factor COX regression analysis to screen the candidate genes to 30, these 30 genes and another set of TCGA data were intersected to obtain 24 common genes. Finally, lasso regression analysis was performed on 24 genes, and a breast cancer prognostic risk prediction model containing 6 related genes was obtained. The model was also found to be related to the infiltration of immune cells. This study provides a new and accurate prognostic model for predicting the survival of breast cancer patients with obesity.",
  "Breast cancer has an extremely high incidence in women, and its morbidity and mortality rank first among female tumors. With the increasing development of medicine today, the clinical application of neoadjuvant chemotherapy has brought new hope to the treatment of breast cancer. Although the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been confirmed, drug resistance is one of the main reasons for its treatment failure, contributing to the difficulty in the treatment of breast cancer. This article focuses on multiple mechanisms of action and expounds a series of recent research advances that mediate drug resistance in breast cancer cells. Drug metabolizing enzymes can mediate a catalytic reaction to inactivate chemotherapeutic drugs and develop drug resistance. The drug efflux system can reduce the drug concentration in breast cancer cells. The combination of glutathione detoxification system and platinum drugs can cause breast cancer cells to be insensitive to drugs. Changes in drug targets have led to poorer efficacy of HER2 receptor inhibitors. Moreover, autophagy, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and tumor microenvironment can all contribute to the development of resistance in breast cancer cells. Based on the relevant research on the existing drug resistance mechanism, the current treatment plan for reversing the resistance of breast cancer to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is explored, and the potential drug targets are analyzed, aiming to provide a new idea and strategy to reverse the resistance of neoadjuvant chemotherapy drugs in breast cancer.",
  "We hypothesize that 5-fraction once weekly hypofractionated (WH) whole breast irradiation (WBI) would be safe and effective after breast-conserving surgery for medically underserved patients with breast cancer. We report the protocol-specified primary endpoint of in-breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) at 5 years.After provided informed consent, patients were treated with WH-WBI after breast-conserving surgery were followed prospectively on an institutional review board-approved protocol. Women included in this study had stage 0-II breast cancer treated with negative surgical margins and met prespecified criteria for being underserved. WH-WBI was 28.5 or 30 Gy delivered to the whole breast with no elective coverage of lymph nodes. The primary endpoint was IBTR at 5 years. Secondary endpoints were distant disease-free survival, recurrence-free survival, overall survival, adverse events, and cosmesis.One hundred fifty-eight patients received WH-WBI on protocol from 2010 to 2015. Median follow-up was 5.5 years (range, 0.2-10.0 years). Stage distribution was 22% ductal carcinoma in situ, 68% invasive pN0, and 10% invasive pN1. Twenty-eight percent of patients had grade 3 tumors, 10% were estrogen receptor negative, and 24% required adjuvant chemotherapy. There were 6 IBTR events. The 5-, 7-, and 10-year risks of IBTR for all patients were 2.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89-6.34), 4.7% (95% CI, 1.4-11.0) and 7.2% (95% CI, 2.4-15.8), respectively. The 5-, 7-, and 10-year rates of distant disease-free survival were 96.4%, 96.4%, and 86.4%; the recurrence-free survival rates were 95.8%, 93.6%, and 80.7%; and the overall survival rates were 96.7%, 88.6%, and 76.7%, respectively. Improvement in IBTR-free time was seen in ductal carcinoma in situ, lobular histology, low-grade tumors, T1 stage, Her2-negative tumors, and receipt of a radiation boost to the lumpectomy bed.Postoperative WH-WBI has favorable disease-specific outcomes that are comparable to those seen with conventional and moderately hypofractionated radiation techniques. WH-WBI could improve access to care for underserved patients with stage 0-II breast cancer.",
  "Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data from 1973-2010 have been used to show that minority women have disproportionately higher percentages of breast cancers diagnosed at younger ages in comparison with White women.The authors analyzed SEER 21 invasive breast cancer incidence data for 2014-2017 and National Center for Health Statistics mortality data for 2014-2018 and compared invasive incidence and mortality by age in non-Hispanic Black (NH-Black), Asian American/Pacific Islander (AAPI), Native American, and Hispanic women with those in non-Hispanic White (NH-White) women. They evaluated incidence rates and percentages of invasive breast cancer cases and breast cancer deaths occurring before the age of 50\u00a0years along with advanced-stage incidence rates and percentages in minority women versus NH-White women.Recent SEER data showed that invasive breast cancers were diagnosed at significantly younger ages in minority women versus NH-White women. Among women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer, compared with NH-White women, minority women were 72% more likely to be diagnosed under the age of 50\u00a0years (relative risk [RR], 1.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.70-1.75), 58% more likely to be diagnosed with advanced-stage breast cancer under the age of 50\u00a0years (RR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.55-1.61), and 24% more likely to be diagnosed with advanced-stage (regional or distant) breast cancer at all ages (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.23-1.25). Among women dying of breast cancer, minority women were 127% more likely to die under the age of 50\u00a0years than NH-White women.NH-Black, AAPI, Native American, and Hispanic women have higher proportions of invasive breast cancers at younger ages and at advanced stages and breast cancer deaths at younger ages than NH-White women.This study analyzes the most recently available data on invasive breast cancers and breast cancer deaths in US women by age and race/ethnicity. Its findings show that non-Hispanic Black, Asian American/Pacific Islander, Native American, and Hispanic women have a higher percentage of invasive breast cancers at younger ages and at more advanced stages and a higher percentage of breast cancer deaths at younger ages than non-Hispanic White women.",
  "To develop and validate radiomic models for preoperative prediction of intraductal component in invasive breast cancer (IBC-IC) using the intratumoral and peritumoral features derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI).The prediction models were developed in a primary cohort of 183 consecutive patients from September 2017 to December 2018, consisting of 45 IBC-IC and 138 invasive breast cancers (IBC). The validation cohort of 111 patients (27 IBC-IC and 84 IBC) from February 2019 to January 2020 was enrolled to test the prediction models. A total of 208 radiomic features were extracted from the intratumoral and peritumoral regions of MRI-visible tumors. Then the radiomic features were selected and combined with clinical characteristics to construct predicting models using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. The area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic, sensitivity, and specificity were used to evaluate the performance of radiomic models.Four radiomic models for prediction of IBC-IC were built including intratumoral radiomic signature, peritumoral radiomic signature, peritumoral radiomic nomogram, and combined intratumoral and peritumoral radiomic signature. The combined intratumoral and peritumoral radiomic signature had the optimal diagnostic performance, with the AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.821 (0.758-0.874), 0.822 (0.680-0.920), and 0.739 (0.658-0.810) in the primary cohort and 0.815 (0.730-0.882), 0.778 (0.577-0.914), and 0.738 (0.631-0.828) in the validation cohort.The radiomic model based on the combined intratumoral and peritumoral features from DCE-MRI showed a good ability to preoperatively predict IBC-IC, which might facilitate the individualized surgical planning for patients with breast cancer before breast-conserving surgery.\u2022\u00b7Preoperative prediction of intraductal component in invasive breast cancer is crucial for breast-conserving surgery planning. \u2022 Peritumoral radiomic features of invasive breast cancer contain useful information to predict intraductal components. \u2022\u00b7Radiomics is a promising non-invasive method to facilitate individualized surgical planning for patients with breast cancer before breast-conserving surgery.",
  "Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers in women and a leading cause of mortality. As per the GLOBCAN report of 2021, breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer which until recently was the most commonly diagnosed cancer. Despite significant efforts to improve early detection and therapeutic efficacy of breast cancer, the frequent emergence of drug resistance remains the predominant basis for the poor prognosis of cancer patients harboring various malignancies. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs) are known to affect a variety of components of genome function, including epigenetics, gene transcription, splicing, translation, as well as many central biological processes like cell cycle progression, cell differentiation, development, and pluripotency. LncRNAs are dysregulated in various malignancies and interact with a multitude of RNAs and proteins to impact drug resistance. LncRNAs regulate chemoresistance in cancer by employing an assortment of molecular mechanisms including multidrug efflux, suppression of apoptosis, DNA damage response, epigenetic alterations, as well as functioning as competitive endogenous RNA. When combined with other regulatory mechanisms, these pathways form a complex orchestration of signaling that ultimately lead to chemoresistance. The current review delves into the role of lncRNAs in inducing drug resistance to conventional therapeutic anti-cancer drugs used for the treatment of breast cancer. We propose that lncRNAs that provoke drug resistance could be used to develop new targeted and tailored therapeutics providing a novel approach to introduce promising personalized treatment modalities to overcome chemoresistance in breast cancer patients. Hence, lncRNAs that drive anticancer drug resistance can be potentially explored as biomarkers of disease prognosis and may provide unique opportunities to circumvent chemoresistance in breast cancer patients.",
  "The progesterone receptor (PR) modulates estrogen receptors \u03b1 (ER\u03b1) action in breast cancer; it is an upregulated target gene of ER, and its expression is dependent on estrogen. PR is also a valuable prognostic biomarker in breast cancer, especially in hormone-positive breast cancer. High expression of PR is more frequently observed in tumors with a better baseline prognosis (ie, luminal A) than tumors with a poor baseline prognosis (ie, luminal B). In the following review, we present the role of PR in breast cancer, including the genomic characteristics and pathways in breast cancer, PR and endocrine therapy.",
  "Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutations have been discovered in solid and hematological malignancies, where they reflect TERT activation and cell-cycle progression. In melanoma, glioma, and thyroid cancers, TERT promoter mutations are associated with a poor prognosis. However, no studies have evaluated the prevalence and prognostic significance of TERT promoter mutations in breast cancer.We analyzed TERT promoter hotspot mutations (C228T and C250T) using direct sequencing of DNA from 319 tumor tissues. We also collected clinical data from cases that were positive for TERT promoter mutations.We detected TERT promoter mutations in three (0.9%) of the 319 cases. Two patients had hormone receptor-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative cancer, while the third patient had triple-negative cancer. All three patients had initially been diagnosed with operable breast cancer and undergone surgical treatment. The relapse-free survivals of these patients were 83, 226, and 270\u00a0months, respectively. The mutations were C250T in the triple-negative cancer case and C228T in the remaining two cases.Given the rarity of TERT promoter mutations, further studies are needed to confirm their prognostic significance in breast cancer cases.",
  "Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a potential non-invasive biomarker of disease status in patients with cancer, and provides important diagnostic and prognostic information in breast cancer. The goal of this study was to quantify cfDNA concentrations during the perioperative period and investigate its potential utility to detect recurrence outcomes in patients with breast cancer.Sixty-two (n\u202f=\u202f62) patients with non-metastatic breast cancer, undergoing curative-intent surgery were screened for inclusion. Blood samples were collected from these patients: pre-operatively (Preop) and post-operatively (PO) at either of the following PO time points; PO week 1-2, PO week 3-4 and PO weeks 5-12 following surgery. cfDNA was extracted and quantified using nanodrop spectrophotometer.In a cohort of 62 patients (age, median (IQR), 51.5(45.0-65.0) years), with a median follow-up of 90 months (interquartile range (IQR),60-120 months), significant association was observed between cfDNA concentrations and risk of recurrence in patients with breast cancer. The group of patients who had disease recurrence during follow-up had significantly higher cfDNA concentrations (cutoff:400\u202fng/ml) compared to the group of patients who remain disease-free (Preop and PO period: p\u202f<\u202f0.0001). The median Recurrence Free Survival (RFS) between the Disease Recurrence (DR) and the Disease Free (DF) groups of patients with breast cancer were 12(20-28.5) months and 72.00 (96-120) months; p\u202f<\u202f0.0001). Univariate and multivariate cox regression analysis indicated that postoperative cfDNA concentration (Hazard ratio:5.0, 95% Confidence Interval:1.19-21.28, p\u202f=\u202f0.028) was an independent negative prognostic factor for RFS in patients with non-metastatic breast cancer.Our study demonstrated that high postoperative cfDNA is associated with increased risk of future recurrence in patients with non-metastatic breast cancer. Further, prospective studies are warranted to validate its clinical utility in breast cancer.",
  "Anterior gradient 3 (AGR3) is associated with breast cancer progression, but its relationship with estrogen and tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer is still unclear. This study was designed to investigate the correlation of ARG3 and estrogen as well as the roles of ARG3 in tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer.Online database including GEPIA, UALCAN, and TCGA and rVista predictive tool were applied to analyze the expression patterns of AGR3 and its relationship with estrogen receptor 1. AGR3 knockdown and overexpression cell models were constructed. Luciferase reporter assay and ChIP were performed to investigate intermolecular interactions. Western blotting and qPCR were applied to assess targets at mRNA and protein levels, respectively. Cell counting and MTT assay were applied to determine the cell proliferation.An elevation of AGR3 was observed in patients with breast cancer, especially in the patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. The TCGA dataset and in vitro data supported that AGR3 was positively correlated to ER. Further results demonstrated that ER protein bound to AGR3 promoter sites. AGR3 expression exhibited a positive correlation to cell viability. Besides, AGR3 promoted tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer.AGR3 is associated with estrogen and promotes tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer.",
  "Genome-wide association studies have identified several breast cancer susceptibility loci.\u00a0However, biomarkers for risk assessment are still missing. Here, we investigated cancer-related molecular changes detected in tissues from women at high risk for breast cancer prior to disease manifestation. Disease-free breast tissue cores donated by healthy women (N\u2009=\u2009146, median age\u2009=\u200939\u00a0years) were processed for both methylome (MethylCap) and transcriptome (Illumina's HiSeq4000) sequencing. Analysis of tissue microarray and primary breast epithelial cells was used to confirm gene expression dysregulation.Transcriptomic analysis identified 69 differentially expressed genes between women at high and those at average risk of breast cancer (Tyrer-Cuzick model) at FDR\u2009<\u20090.05 and fold change\u2009\u2265\u20092. Majority of the identified genes were involved in DNA damage checkpoint, cell cycle, and cell adhesion. Two genes, FAM83A and NEK2, were overexpressed in tissue sections (FDR\u2009<\u20090.01) and primary epithelial cells (p\u2009<\u20090.05) from high-risk breasts. Moreover, 1698 DNA methylation changes were identified in high-risk breast tissues (FDR\u2009<\u20090.05), partially overlapped with cancer-related signatures, and correlated with transcriptional changes (p\u2009<\u20090.05, r\u2009\u2264\u20090.5). Finally, among the participants, 35 women donated breast biopsies at two time points, and age-related molecular alterations enhanced in high-risk subjects were identified.Normal breast tissue from women at high risk of breast cancer bears molecular aberrations that may contribute to breast cancer susceptibility. This study is the first molecular characterization of the true normal breast tissues, and provides an opportunity to investigate molecular markers of breast cancer risk, which may lead to new preventive approaches.",
  "The exact location of the original tumor should be known for a targeted increase in the dose to the tumor bed after breast cancer surgery. Therefore, at our site, we perform CT examinations of patients in the radiation position before breast cancer surgery.Preoperative native CT scans were performed in the patients in the planning position for radiotherapy; these data were fused with standard planning CT for boost irradiation. We evaluated whether the tumor was accurately identifiable in preoperative CT scans. We also contoured one irradiation volume in the standard planning CT scans and the other in the fusion CT scans with preoperative examination, and compared these volumes.Out of the total number of 554 patients, we were able to identify the exact location of the breast tumor in 463 cases (83.6 %). In a group of 50 randomly selected patients, the clinical target volume for the boost dose to the postlumpectomy cavity was changed in 20 patients (40%) - decreased in 9 cases (18%) and increased in 11 cases (22%).As shown by the results of our study, preoperative CT in the planning position can be used in patients with confirmed breast cancer. This method allows us to more accurately locate the tumor bed and thus more accurately draw the target volume for boost irradiation. We confirmed that preoperative CT had an impact on the size of the target volume.",
  "Many risk factors have been identified for breast cancer. The potential causality for some of them remains uncertain, and few studies have comprehensively investigated these associations by molecular subtypes. We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to evaluate potential causal associations of 23 known and suspected risk factors and biomarkers with breast cancer risk overall and by molecular subtypes using data from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium. The inverse-variance weighted method was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for association of each trait with breast cancer risk. Significant associations with breast cancer risk were found for 15 traits, including age at menarche, age at menopause, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, height, physical activity, cigarette smoking, sleep duration, and morning-preference chronotype, and six blood biomarkers (estrogens, insulin-like growth factor-1, sex hormone-binding globulin [SHBG], telomere length, HDL-cholesterol and fasting insulin). Noticeably, an increased circulating SHBG was associated with a reduced risk of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive cancer (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.83, 95% CI: 0.73-0.94), but an elevated risk of ER-negative (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.12, 95% CI: 0.93-1.36) and triple negative cancer (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.19, 95% CI: 0.92-1.54) (P<sub>heterogeneity</sub> \u00a0=\u00a00.01). Fasting insulin was most strongly associated with an increased risk of HER2-negative cancer (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.94, 95% CI: 1.18-3.20), but a reduced risk of HER2-enriched cancer (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.46, 95% CI: 0.26-0.81) (P<sub>heterogeneity</sub> \u00a0=\u00a00.006). Results from sensitivity analyses using MR-Egger and MR-PRESSO were generally consistent. Our study provides strong evidence supporting potential causal associations of several risk factors for breast cancer and suggests potential heterogeneous associations of SHBG and fasting insulin levels with subtypes of breast cancer.",
  "The tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL)-ultrasonography (US) score determined through characteristic US findings has predictive performance of lymphocyte-predominant breast cancer (LPBC). This study aimed to investigate whether the TIL-US score before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) can predict the pathological complete response (pCR).We evaluated patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer (n\u00a0=\u00a055) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (n\u00a0=\u00a024) who underwent surgery after NAC from November 2012 to April 2019. Pre-NAC biopsy examination was performed to examine stromal TILs; the cutoff value for predicting pCR was defined as \u226550% stromal TILs. The TILs-US score was calculated from the pre-NAC US findings. Based on previous data, the cutoff value for predicting pCR was set at \u22654 points.Forty-six patients achieved pCR. The TIL-US score was significantly associated with the pCR rate (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) but not the pre-NAC biopsy findings (p\u00a0=\u00a00.055). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that a TILs-US score \u22654 and HER2 positivity were significant pCR predictors (odds ratio [OR] 3.69; p\u00a0=\u00a00.031; OR 8.74; p\u00a0=\u00a00.025).TILs-US scores can be used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of NAC, and may be used as a non-invasive, convenient, and an alternative method to assess stromal TILs in pre-treatment biopsies.",
  "Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor diagnosed in women. It is the second leading cause of cancer-related death among women in the world. Aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified to be involved in the development and progression of breast cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the function of miR-223-3p in breast cancer progression and metastasis.qRT-PCR was used to analyze the expression levels of miR-223-3p in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. Wound healing and Matrigel assays were used to examine cell motility and invasiveness. FBXW7 3'-UTR construct and luciferase reporter assays were performed for the target gene.miR-223-3p was overexpressed in breast cancer tissue and cell lines. A high level of miR-223-3p was associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. In addition, overexpressed miR-223-3p promoted the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that tumor suppressor gene FBXW7 is a target of miR-223-3p. Luciferase activity reporter assay indicated miR-223-3p could directly bind with the 3'-UTR of FBXW7. miR-223-3p exhibited its oncogenic role partly by decreasing FBXW7 expression, and consequently promoted the invasion and metastasis of breast cancer cells.Our study revealed a physical and functional relationship among miR-223-3p and FBXW7. By negatively regulating FBXW7 expression, miR-223-3p exerts a tumor promotion role promoting cell invasion and metastasis in breast cancer.",
  "Hormone therapy targeting the estrogen receptor (ER) pathway is the most common treatment used for ER-positive breast cancer. However, some patients experience de novo or acquired resistance, which becomes a critical problem. Activation of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway allows breast cancer cells to proliferate and is associated with the ER pathway. Little is known about the role of the IGF pathway in hormone therapy and resistance; therefore, we investigated whether the inhibition of this pathway may represent a novel therapeutic target for overcoming hormone therapy resistance in ER-positive breast cancers.Crosstalk between the ER and IGF pathways was analyzed in breast cancer cell lines by inhibiting or stimulating either one or both pathways. We studied the effect of insulin-like growth factor one receptor (IGF1R) inhibition in aromatase inhibitor-resistant breast cancer cell lines and fulvestrant-resistant cell lines which were uniquely established in our laboratory.Under normal conditions, IGF signaling is controlled by ER signaling to promote cell growth. Temporary disruption of the estrogen supply results in attenuated ER signaling, and IGF-1 dramatically increased relative growth compared with normal conditions. In addition, IGF1R inhibitor strongly suppressd cell growth in hormone-resistant breast cancer cells where ER remains than cells where ER decreased or was almost lost.Our study suggests that inhibition of the IGF pathway may be an effective strategy for ER-positive breast cancer therapy, even in hormone therapy-resistant cases.",
  "Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has become one of the most promising approaches to activating antitumor immunity. However, only a small subset of patients with breast cancer benefit from ICB treatment. To improve the therapeutic effect in the clinic, precision immunotherapy is proposed to accurately eliminate cancer stem cells that contribute to local recurrence or metastasis, but currently little is known about their immunological properties. In this study, breast cancer-specific datasets in The Cancer Genome Atlas were collected and analyzed by using multiple open-access web servers. We found that the immunophenotype of breast cancer was characterized by a hypoactive immune microenvironment and a low response to immune checkpoint blockade. The innate immune checkpoint CD200 and the adaptive immune checkpoint CD276, respectively, exhibited a strong correlation with basal/stem gene signature and invasiveness gene signature, both of which represent breast cancer stem cells. Wnt, TGF-\u03b2, and Hedgehog signaling, which are recognized as stemness-related pathways, showed a significant association with the expression of CD200 and CD276, suggesting cancer stem cell-specific immune checkpoints could be downregulated by inhibiting these pathways. Of note, levels of CD200 and CD276 expression were higher in TGF-\u03b2 dominant breast cancer than in other immune types of breast cancer. We also identified gene signatures that represent Wnt, TGF-\u03b2, and Hedgehog signaling-related CD200 and CD276 expression in breast cancer stem cells. For the luminal A subtype, the patient group with a high level of these gene signatures plus a low infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, or dendritic cells, or M1 macrophages had poor overall survival. Our study suggested that CD200 and CD276 are candidate inhibitory immune checkpoints in breast cancer stem cells, which are potentially regulated by Wnt, TGF-\u03b2, and Hedgehog signaling. Synergistic inhibition of these stemness-related pathways may improve the efficacy of ICB treatment targeting breast cancer stem cells in precision immunotherapy.",
  "Breast cancer ranks as the major reason for mortality in women populations, accounting for 23% of all cancer deaths. One in every three Asian women encounters the risk of this cancer in their lifetime. Long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) have emerged as tumor promoters and suppressors. The molecular mechanism of breast cancer remains elusive. Therefore, the current study aimed to explore the role lincRNA LINC00922 plays in the development of breast cancer. Breast cancer tissues and adjacent tissues were obtained from 109 patients with breast cancer. The RNA extraction and quantification and immunohistochemical staining characterized the high expression of LINC00922 and low expression of NKD2 in breast cancer tissues in comparison to its adjacent counterparts. Furthermore, the ectopic expression and knockdown experiments were conducted to figure out the in vivo and in vitro effects of LINC00922 on breast cancer progression. The ectopically expressed LINC00922 activated the Wnt signaling pathway, promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cell proliferative, invasive and migratory capacities, tumor growth and metastasis. Additionally, the RIP and ChIP assay identified that LINC00922 recruited DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B proteins in the promoter region of NKD2 to promote NKD2 promoter methylation, thus reducing the NKD2 expression. Moreover, the Wnt signaling pathway was activated subsequent to NKD2 silencing, which was reversed by LINC00922 silencing. Lastly, the anti-oncogenic effects of LINC00922 inhibition was antagonized after NKD2 knocked down. The current study provides evidence that LINC00922 acts as a tumor promoter by promoting NKD2 methylation. Hopefully, it provides a novel potential gene target for the treatment of breast cancer.",
  "Disparities in breast cancer survival by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status have been reported. However, it is unclear if these findings are reproducible among subpopulations. This study aimed to assess if socially oriented factors are predictive of overall survival (OS) among patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR<sup>+</sup>), human epidermal growth factor 2-positive (HER2<sup>+</sup>) metastatic breast cancer (MBC).We analyzed patients with MBC included in the National Cancer Database diagnosed with HR<sup>+</sup> and HER2<sup>+</sup> disease treated between 2010 and 2015. Multivariate analyses describe the association between non-clinical prognostic factors and OS. A matched analysis, which balanced prognostic factors between whites and African Americans (AA), was also conducted.Of the 6200 patients analyzed, the majority were 50 years or older, white, and treated with hormonal therapy. Disparities in OS were observed; multivariate analysis revealed diminished survival was associated with low income (< $38K vs.\u00a0\u2265 $63K, hazard ratio [HR], 1.30; P\u00a0< .001), having government insurance (government vs. private, HR, 1.55; P\u00a0< .001), living closer to one's treatment facility (< 4 miles vs.\u00a0\u2265 18 miles, HR, 1.16; P\u00a0= .04), and being AA (AA vs. white, HR, 1.20; P\u00a0= .006). The mortality disparity attributed to race was insignificant in the matched analysis (AA vs. white, HR, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.98-1.30; P\u00a0= .09).This study confirms that the known sociodemographic disparities in OS among patients with MBC are similar within the HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>+</sup> subpopulation. The discordance of outcomes between matched and unmatched analysis demonstrate that there is a highly vulnerable subgroup of AAs. Further investigation is required to determine if the identified associations are independently causal of poor prognosis.",
  "A clear picture of treatment-related health problems following breast cancer treatment is useful in anticipating the informational and other needs of patients during follow-up. This study aimed to identify treatment-related health problems in breast cancer patients up to five years after diagnosis. Secondly, the use of care associated with these health problems was identified.876 surgically-treated female patients diagnosed between 2012 and 2016 with early-stage breast cancer were asked to complete an online survey about their current health problems and use of care. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied to determine the effect of patient and treatment characteristics on health problems.404 patients responded (46%). The median age was 62.0 years (SD:10.9). Apart from breast surgery, patients had been treated with radiotherapy (72%), chemotherapy (49%), anti-hormonal therapy (57%), and axillary dissection (21%). Ninety-three percent experienced one or more health problems. Over 50% of respondents experienced fatigue, psychological problems, and health problems regarding the breast, and/or musculoskeletal, central nervous, and reproductive system. Treatment with chemotherapy was significantly associated (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) with an increased risk of health problems, respectively fatigue (OR:2.00), respiratory (OR:1.81), gastrointestinal (OR:1.87), central nervous (OR:3.40), and skin problems (OR:2.62). Use of healthcare for one or more health problems was reported by 64% of respondents.Almost all patients experienced health problems up to five years after breast cancer diagnosis, with a range of complaints that were consistently present over time. Factors associated with the development of health problems are useful for better informing patients beforehand and targeting follow-up care.",
  "The Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) model predicts risk of invasive breast cancer risk based on age, race, family history, breast density, and history of benign breast disease, including lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). However, validation studies for this model included few women with LCIS. We sought to evaluate the accuracy of the BCSC model among this cohort.Women with LCIS diagnosed between 1983 and 2017 were identified from a prospectively maintained database. The BCSC score was calculated; those with prior breast cancer, unknown breast density, age < 35 years or > 74 years, or with history of chemoprevention use were excluded. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate incidence rates. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to analyze the discriminative capacity of the model.1302 women with LCIS were included. At a median follow-up of 7\u00a0years, 152 women (12%) developed invasive cancer (6 with bilateral disease). Cumulative incidences of invasive breast cancer were 7.1% (95% CI 5.6-8.7) and 13.3% (95% CI 10.9-15.6), respectively, and the median BCSC risk scores were 4.9 and 10.4, respectively, at 5 and 10\u00a0years. The median 10-year BCSC score was significantly lower than the 10-year Tyrer-Cuzick score (10.4 vs 20.8, p\u2009<\u20090.001). The ROC curve scores (AUC) for BCSC at 5 and 10\u00a0years were 0.59 (95% CI 0.52-0.66) and 0.58 (95% CI 0.52-0.64), respectively.The BCSC model has moderate accuracy in predicting invasive breast cancer risk among women with LCIS with fair discrimination for risk prediction between individuals."
